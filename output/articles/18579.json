{"title":"Government shutdowns in the United States","summary":"Government shutdowns in the United States occur when there is a failure to enact funding legislation to finance the government for its next fiscal year or a temporary funding measure. Ever since a 1980 interpretation of the 1884 Antideficiency Act, a \"lapse of appropriation\" due to a political impasse on proposed appropriation bills requires that the US federal government curtail agency activities and services, close down non-essential operations, furlough non-essential workers, and only retain essential employees in departments covering the safety of human life or protection of property.[1] Voluntary services may only be accepted when required for the safety of life or property.[1]  Shutdowns can also occur within and disrupt state, territorial, and local levels of government.","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg.png.webp"}
