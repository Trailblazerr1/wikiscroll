{"title":"Jan van Eyck","summary":"Jan van Eyck (/væn ˈaɪk/ van EYEK, Dutch: [ˈjɑn vɑn ˈɛik]; c.  before 1390 – 9 July 1441) was a painter active in Bruges who was one of the early innovators of what became known as Early Netherlandish painting, and one of the most significant representatives of Early Northern Renaissance art. According to Vasari and other art historians including Ernst Gombrich, he invented oil painting,[1] though most now regard that as an over-simplification.","image":"Portrait_of_a_Man_by_Jan_van_Eyck-small.jpg.webp"}
