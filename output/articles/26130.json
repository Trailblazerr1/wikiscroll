{"title":"Ligand","summary":"In coordination chemistry, a ligand[lower-alpha 1] is an ion or molecule (functional group) that binds to a central atom to form a coordination complex. The bonding with the metal generally involves formal donation of one or more of the ligand's electron pairs often through Lewis Bases.[1] The nature of metal–ligand bonding can range from covalent to ionic. Furthermore, the metal–ligand bond order can range from one to three. Ligands are viewed as Lewis bases, although rare cases are known to involve Lewis acidic \"ligands\".[2][3]","image":"HCo(CO)4-3D-balls.png.webp","url":"Ligand"}
