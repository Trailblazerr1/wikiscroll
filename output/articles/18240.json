{"title":"Globus pallidus","summary":"The globus pallidus (GP), also known as paleostriatum or dorsal pallidum,[1] is a subcortical structure of the brain. It consists of two adjacent segments, one external, known in rodents simply as the globus pallidus, and one internal, known in rodents as the entopeduncular nucleus. It is part of the telencephalon, but retains close functional ties with the subthalamus in the diencephalon â€“ both of which are part of the extrapyramidal motor system.[2] The globus pallidus is a major component of the basal ganglia, with principal inputs from the striatum, and principal direct outputs to the thalamus and the substantia nigra. The latter is made up of similar neuronal elements, has similar afferents from the striatum, similar projections to the thalamus, and has a similar synaptology. Neither receives direct cortical afferents, and both receive substantial additional inputs from the intralaminar thalamus.","image":"Globus_pallidus.svg.png.webp","url":"Globus_pallidus"}
