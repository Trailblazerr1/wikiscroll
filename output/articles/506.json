{"title":"2010 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans","summary":"An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\".  Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media.  Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.[1]  The 2010 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the Sporting News (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.  All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC and AP choose third teams, and TSN chooses third, fourth and fifth teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.","image":"Sherron_Collins_by_Judd_Furlong_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
