{"title":"Milton Obote","summary":"Apollo Milton Obote (28 December 1925 – 10 October 2005)[1] was a Ugandan political leader who led Uganda to independence in 1962 from British colonial administration. Following the nation's independence, he served as prime minister of Uganda from 1962 to 1966 and the second president of Uganda from 1966 to 1971, then again from 1980 to 1985. He was overthrown in a coup d'état by Idi Amin in 1971, but was re-elected in 1980 a year after Amin's 1979 overthrow.[2] His second period of rule ended after a long and bloody conflict known as the Ugandan Bush War,[3] during which he was overthrown a second time by another coup d'état in 1985, prompting him to live the rest of his life in exile.","image":"Obote_cropped.png.webp"}
