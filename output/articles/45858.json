{"title":"Treaty of San Francisco","summary":"The Treaty of San Francisco (サンフランシスコ講和条約, San-Furanshisuko kōwa-Jōyaku), also called the Treaty of Peace with Japan (日本国との平和条約, Nihon-koku to no Heiwa-Jōyaku), re-established peaceful relations between Japan and the Allied Powers on behalf of the United Nations by ending the legal state of war and providing for redress for hostile actions up to and including World War II. It was signed by 49 nations on 8 September 1951, in San Francisco, California, U.S. at the War Memorial Opera House[2]. Communist-controlled Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia, all part of the Soviet Bloc, refused to send representatives, as did India and Yugoslavia. Italy and \"China\" were not invited, the latter due to disagreements on whether the Republic of China or the People's Republic of China represented the Chinese people. Korea was also not invited due to a similar disagreement on whether South Korea or North Korea represented the Korean people.[3]","image":"Yoshida_signs_San_Francisco_Peace_Treaty.jpg.webp","url":"Treaty_of_San_Francisco"}
