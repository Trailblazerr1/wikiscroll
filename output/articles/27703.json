{"title":"Lynn Margulis","summary":"Lynn Margulis (born Lynn Petra Alexander;[2][3] March 5, 1938 – November 22, 2011)[4] was an American evolutionary theorist, biologist, science author, educator, and science popularizer, and was the primary modern proponent for the significance of symbiosis in evolution. Historian Jan Sapp has said that \"Lynn Margulis's name is as synonymous with symbiosis as Charles Darwin's is with evolution.\"[5] In particular, Margulis transformed and fundamentally framed current understanding of the evolution of cells with nuclei – an event Ernst Mayr called \"perhaps the most important and dramatic event in the history of life\"[6] – by proposing it to have been the result of symbiotic mergers of bacteria. Margulis was also the co-developer of the Gaia hypothesis with the British chemist James Lovelock, proposing that the Earth functions as a single self-regulating system, and was the principal defender and promulgator of the five kingdom classification of Robert Whittaker.","image":"Lynn_Margulis.jpg.webp","url":"Lynn_Margulis"}
