{"title":"Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien","summary":"The English philologist and author J. R. R. Tolkien created a number of constructed languages, including languages devised for fictional settings. Inventing languages, something that he called glossopoeia (paralleling his idea of mythopoeia or myth-making), was a lifelong occupation for Tolkien, starting in his teens.[1] An early project was the reconstruction of an unrecorded early Germanic language which might have been spoken by the people of Beowulf in the Germanic Heroic Age.[2]","image":"Linguistic_Map_of_Middle-Earth.svg.png.webp","url":"Languages_constructed_by_J._R._R._Tolkien"}
