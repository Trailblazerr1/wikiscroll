{"title":"White genocide conspiracy theory","summary":"The white genocide, white extinction,[1] or white replacement conspiracy theory[2][3][4] is a white supremacist[5][6][7][8] conspiracy theory which states that there is a deliberate plot, often blamed on Jews,[5][8] to promote miscegenation,[9] interracial marriage, mass non-white immigration, racial integration, low fertility rates, abortion, governmental land-confiscation from whites, organised violence,[10] and eliminationism in white-founded countries[5] in order to cause the extinction of whites through forced assimilation,[10] mass immigration, and violent genocide.[11][12][13][14] Less frequently, black people,[15] Hispanics,[16] and Muslims[17] are blamed, but merely as more fertile immigrants,[18] invaders,[19] or violent aggressors,[20] rather than the masterminds of a secret plot.[21]","image":"Calais_-_Manifestation_contre_les_clandestins%2C_l'immigration-invasion_et_l'islamisation_de_l'Europe%2C_8_novembre_2015_(22).JPG.webp"}
