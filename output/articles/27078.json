{"title":"Lithium–sulfur battery","summary":"The lithium–sulfur battery (Li–S battery) is a type of rechargeable battery, notable for its high specific energy.[2] The low atomic weight of lithium and moderate atomic weight of sulfur means that Li–S batteries are relatively light (about the density of water). They were used on the longest and highest-altitude unmanned solar-powered aeroplane flight (at the time) by Zephyr 6 in August 2008.[3]","image":"Li-S_battery_EN.png.webp","url":"Lithium–sulfur_battery"}
