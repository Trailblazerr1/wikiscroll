{"title":"Unreliable narrator","summary":"An unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility is compromised.[1] They can be found in fiction and film, and range from children to mature characters.[2] The term was coined in 1961 by Wayne C. Booth in The Rhetoric of Fiction.[1][3] While unreliable narrators are almost by definition first-person narrators, arguments have been made for the existence of unreliable second- and third-person narrators, especially within the context of film and television, and sometimes also in literature.[4]","image":"Gustave_Doré_-_Baron_von_Münchhausen_-_067.jpg.webp","url":"Unreliable_narrator"}
