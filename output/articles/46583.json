{"title":"Ungulate","summary":"Ungulates (/ˈʌŋɡjəleɪts, -ləts/ UNG-gyə-layts, -⁠ləts) are members of the diverse clade Ungulata which primarily consists of large mammals with hooves. These include odd-toed ungulates such as horses, rhinoceroses, and tapirs; and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, sheep, deer, and hippopotamuses. Cetaceans such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises are also classified as even-toed ungulates, although they do not have hooves. Most terrestrial ungulates use the hoofed tips of their toes to support their body weight while standing or moving.","image":"Clade_Ungulata_Two_Orders.jpg.webp","url":"Ungulate"}
