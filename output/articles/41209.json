{"title":"Sodom and Gomorrah","summary":"Sodom and Gomorrah (/ˈsɒdəm ... ɡəˈmɒrə/) were two legendary biblical cities destroyed by God for their wickedness.[1] Their story parallels the Genesis flood narrative in its theme of God's anger provoked by sin (see Book of Genesis 19:1–28).[2] They are mentioned frequently in the prophets and the New Testament as symbols of human wickedness and divine retribution, and the Quran also contains a version of the story about the two cities.[3] The legend of their destruction may have originated as an attempt to explain the remains of third-millennium Bronze Age cities in the region.[1]","image":"Sodom_and_Gomorrah_afire%2C_by_Jacob_Jacobsz._de_Wet_d._J.%2C_probably_Köln%2C_c._1680%2C_oil_on_canvas_-_Hessisches_Landesmuseum_Darmstadt_-_Darmstadt%2C_Germany_-_DSC01149.jpg.webp","url":"Sodom_and_Gomorrah"}
