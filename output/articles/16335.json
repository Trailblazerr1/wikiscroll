{"title":"Fitness (biology)","summary":"Fitness (often denoted w {\\displaystyle w} or Ï‰ in population genetics models) is the quantitative representation of natural and sexual selection within evolutionary biology. It can be defined either with respect to a genotype or to a phenotype in a given environment. In either case, it describes individual reproductive success and is equal to the average contribution to the gene pool of the next generation that is made by individuals of the specified genotype or phenotype. The fitness of a genotype is manifested through its phenotype, which is also affected by the developmental environment. The fitness of a given phenotype can also be different in different selective environments.","image":"88b1e0c8e1be5ebe69d18a8010676fa42d7961e6.svg","url":"Fitness_(biology)"}
