{"title":"Stereochemistry","summary":"Stereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, involves the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation.[1] The study of stereochemistry focuses on stereoisomers, which by definition have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. For this reason, it is also known as 3D chemistryâ€”the prefix \"stereo-\" means \"three-dimensionality\".[2]","image":"Isomerism.svg.png.webp","url":"Stereochemistry"}
