{"title":"SMS Goeben","summary":"SMS Goeben[lower-alpha 1] was the second of two  Moltke-class battlecruisers of the Imperial German Navy, launched in 1911 and named after the German Franco-Prussian War veteran General August Karl von Goeben. Along with her sister ship, Goeben was similar to the previous German battlecruiser design, Von der Tann, but larger, with increased armor protection and two more main guns in an additional turret. Goeben and Moltke were significantly larger and better armored than the comparable British  Indefatigable class.[lower-alpha 2]","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-61-15%2C_Panzerkreuzer_\"SMS_Goeben\".jpg.webp","url":"SMS_Goeben"}
