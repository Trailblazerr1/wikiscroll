{"title":"Perfect (grammar)","summary":"The perfect tense or aspect (abbreviated PERF or PRF) is a verb form that indicates that an action or circumstance occurred earlier than the time under consideration, often focusing attention on the resulting state rather than on the occurrence itself. An example of a perfect construction is I have made dinner. Although this gives information about a prior action (my making of the dinner), the focus is likely to be on the present consequences of that action (the fact that the dinner is now ready). The word perfect in this sense means \"completed\" (from Latin perfectum, which is the perfect passive participle of the verb perficere \"to complete\").","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
