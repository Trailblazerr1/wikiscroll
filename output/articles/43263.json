{"title":"Tactical role-playing game","summary":"Tactical role-playing games[1][2][3][4] (abbreviated as TRPG), known in Japan as simulation RPG[lower-alpha 1] (abbreviated SRPG), are a genre of video games which combine core elements of role-playing video games with that of tactical (turn-based or real-time) strategy video games. The formats of tactical RPGs are much like traditional tabletop role-playing games and strategy games in their appearance, pacing and rule structure. Likewise, early tabletop role-playing games are descended from skirmish wargames like Chainmail, which were primarily concerned with combat.","image":"Role-playing_video_game_icon.svg.png.webp"}
