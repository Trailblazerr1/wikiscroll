{"title":"Line (geometry)","summary":"In geometry, the notion of line or straight line was introduced by ancient mathematicians to represent straight objects (i.e., having no curvature) with negligible width and depth. Lines are an idealization of such objects, which are often described in terms of two points (e.g., \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              A\n              B\n            \n            ↔\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\overleftrightarrow {AB}}}\n  \n) or referred to using a single letter (e.g., \n  \n    \n      \n        ℓ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ell }\n  \n).[1]","image":"c2eb924a8b10e054cea618dd9a53c96550b7fb4b.svg"}
