{"title":"Belgian Shepherd","summary":"The Belgian Shepherd  (also known as the Belgian Sheepdog or the Chien de Berger Belge) is a breed of medium-sized herding dog from Belgium. While predominantly considered a single breed, it is bred in four distinct varieties based on coat type and colour; the long-haired black Groenendael, the rough-haired fawn Laekenois, the short-haired fawn Malinois, and the long-haired fawn Tervuren; in the United States the American Kennel Club considers the four varieties to be separate breeds.","image":"04_-_Belgian_shepherd_dog_varieties_-_Groenendael%2CTervuren%2C_Malinois%2C_Laekenois.jpg.webp"}
