{"title":"Tonicity","summary":"Tonicity is a measure of the effective osmotic pressure gradient; the water potential of two solutions separated by a semipermeable cell membrane. Tonicity depends on the relative concentration of selectively membrane permeable solutes across a cell membrane which determine the direction and extent of osmotic flux. It is commonly used when describing the swelling versus shrinking response of cells immersed in an external solution.","image":"Osmotic_pressure_on_blood_cells_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
