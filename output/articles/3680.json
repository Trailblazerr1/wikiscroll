{"title":"Angiogenesis","summary":"Angiogenesis is the physiological process through which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels,[1][2][3] formed in the earlier stage of vasculogenesis. Angiogenesis continues the growth of the vasculature by processes of sprouting and splitting.[4] Vasculogenesis is the embryonic formation of endothelial cells from mesoderm cell precursors,[5] and from neovascularization, although discussions are not always precise (especially in older texts). The first vessels in the developing embryo form through vasculogenesis, after which angiogenesis is responsible for most, if not all, blood vessel growth during development and in disease.[6]","image":"Angiogenesis.png.webp","url":"Angiogenesis"}
