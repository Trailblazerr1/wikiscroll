{"title":"Heinrich Heine","summary":"Christian Johann Heinrich Heine (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈhaɪnə] (listen); born Harry Heine; 13 December 1797 – 17 February 1856) was a German poet, writer and literary critic. He is best known outside Germany for his early lyric poetry, which was set to music in the form of lieder (art songs) by composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert. Heine's later verse and prose are distinguished by their satirical wit and irony. He is considered a member of the Young Germany movement. His radical political views led to many of his works being banned by German authorities—which, however, only added to his fame.[1] He spent the last 25 years of his life as an expatriate in Paris.","image":"Heinrich_Heine-Oppenheim.jpg.webp","url":"Heinrich_Heine"}
