{"title":"Acyl chloride","summary":"In organic chemistry, an acyl chloride (or acid chloride) is an organic compound with the functional group -COCl. Their formula is usually written RCOCl, where R is a side chain.  They  are reactive derivatives of carboxylic acids.  A specific example of an acyl chloride is acetyl chloride, CH3COCl. Acyl chlorides are the most important subset of acyl halides.","image":"General_structural_formula_of_carboxylic_acid_chlorides.svg.png.webp","url":"Acyl_chloride"}
