{"title":"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid","summary":"\"Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid\" was the first article published to describe the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, using X-ray diffraction and the mathematics of a helix transform. It was published by Francis Crick and James D. Watson in the scientific journal Nature on pages 737â€“738 of its 171st volume (dated 25 April 1953).[1][2]","image":"DNA-structure-and-bases.png.webp"}
