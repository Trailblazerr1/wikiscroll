{"title":"Gene regulatory network","summary":"A gene (or genetic) regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the gene expression levels of mRNA and proteins which, in turn, determine the function of the cell. GRN also play a central role in morphogenesis, the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).","image":"Gene_Regulatory_Network.jpg.webp","url":"Gene_regulatory_network"}
