{"title":"Spiel des Jahres","summary":"The Spiel des Jahres (German: [ˈʃpiːl dəs ˈjaːʁəs], Game of the Year) is an award for board and card games, created in 1978 with the purpose of rewarding family-friendly game design, and promoting excellent games in the German market.[1] It is thought that the existence and popularity of the award was one of the major drivers of the quality of games coming out of Germany, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.  A Spiel des Jahres nomination can increase the typical sales of a game from 500 to 3,000 copies to around 10,000; and the winner can usually expect to sell to as large as 30 million copies.[2]","image":"Harald_Schrapers.jpg.webp"}
