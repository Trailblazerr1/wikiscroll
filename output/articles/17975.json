{"title":"Gestation","summary":"Gestation is the period of development during the carrying of an embryo, and later fetus, inside viviparous animals (the embryo develops within the parent).[1] It is typical for mammals, but also occurs for some non-mammals. Mammals during pregnancy can have one or more gestations at the same time, for example in a multiple birth.[2]","image":"Feminology%3B_a_guide_for_womankind%2C_giving_in_detail_instructions_as_to_motherhood%2C_maidenhood%2C_and_the_nursery_(1902)_(14761381441).jpg.webp","url":"Gestation"}
