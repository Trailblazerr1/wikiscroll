{"title":"Testosterone","summary":"Testosterone is the primary sex hormone and anabolic steroid in males.[3] In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.[4] In addition, testosterone in both sexes is involved in health and well-being, including moods, behaviour, and in the prevention of osteoporosis.[5][6] Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.","image":"Testosteron.svg.png.webp"}
