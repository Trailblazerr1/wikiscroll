{"title":"Biopharmaceutical","summary":"A biopharmaceutical, also known as a biologic(al) medical product,[1] or biologic, is any pharmaceutical drug product manufactured in, extracted from, or semisynthesized from biological sources. Different from totally synthesized pharmaceuticals, they include vaccines, whole blood, blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene therapies, tissues, recombinant therapeutic protein, and living medicines used in cell therapy. Biologics can be composed of sugars, proteins, nucleic acids, or complex combinations of these substances, or may be living cells or tissues. They (or their precursors or components) are isolated from living sourcesâ€”human, animal, plant, fungal, or microbial. They can be used in both human and animal medicine.[2][3]","image":"FreshFrozenPlasma.JPG.webp","url":"Biopharmaceutical"}
