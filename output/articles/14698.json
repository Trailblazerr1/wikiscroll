{"title":"Emma Lazarus","summary":"Emma Lazarus (July 22, 1849 â€“ November 19, 1887) was an American author of poetry, prose, and translations, as well as an activist for Jewish causes. She is remembered for writing the sonnet \"The New Colossus\" in 1883.[1] Its lines appear inscribed on a bronze plaque, installed in 1903,[2] on the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.[3] The last lines of the sonnet were set to music by Irving Berlin as the song \"Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor\" for the 1949 musical Miss Liberty, which was based on the sculpting of the Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World). The latter part of the sonnet was also set by Lee Hoiby in his song \"The Lady of the Harbor\" written in 1985 as part of his song cycle \"Three Women\".","image":"Emmalazarusengraving.jpg.webp"}
