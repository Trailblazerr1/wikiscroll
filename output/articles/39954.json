{"title":"Selene","summary":"In Greek mythology, Selene (/sɪˈliːniː/; Ancient Greek: Σελήνη, romanized: Selḗnē, lit. '\"Moon\"', Greek pronunciation: [selɛ̌ːnɛː]) is the goddess of the Moon. She is the daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, and sister of the sun god Helios and the dawn goddess Eos. She drives her moon chariot across the heavens. Several lovers are attributed to her in various myths, including Zeus, Pan, and the mortal Endymion. In classical times, Selene was often identified with Artemis, much as her brother, Helios, was identified with Apollo.[2] Selene and Artemis were also associated with Hecate and all three were regarded as moon and lunar goddesses, but only Selene was regarded as the personification of the Moon itself. Her Roman equivalent is Luna.[3]","image":"Clipeus_Selene_Terme.jpg.webp","url":"Selene"}
