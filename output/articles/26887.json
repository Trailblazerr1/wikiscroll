{"title":"List of justices of the Supreme Court of Canada","summary":"The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court of Canada. It was established by the Parliament of Canada through the Supreme and Exchequer Court Act of 1875.[1]  Since 1949, the Court has been the final court of appeal in the Canadian justice system.  Originally composed of six justices (the Chief Justice of Canada and five puisne justices), the Court was expanded to seven justices by the creation of an additional puisne justice position in 1927,[2] and then to nine justices by the creation of two more puisne justice positions in 1949.[3]","image":"St_Edward's_Crown_with_maple_leaves.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_justices_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_Canada"}
