{"title":"Badmotorfinger","summary":"Badmotorfinger is the third studio album by American rock band Soundgarden, released on October 8, 1991,[2] through A&M Records. Soundgarden began the recording sessions for the album with new bassist Ben Shepherd in the spring of 1991. The album maintained the band's heavy metal sound while featuring an increased focus on songwriting as compared with the band's previous releases. AllMusic considered the album's music to be \"surprisingly cerebral and arty\"; alternative tunings and odd time signatures were present on several of the album's songs, and lyrics were intended to be ambiguous and create imagery.","image":"Soundgarden_-_Badmotorfinger.jpg.webp","url":"Badmotorfinger"}
