{"title":"Aristotle's biology","summary":"Aristotle's biology is the theory of biology, grounded in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science. Many of his observations were made during his stay on the island of Lesbos, including especially his descriptions of the marine biology of the Pyrrha lagoon, now the Gulf of Kalloni. His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.","image":"Costantinopoli%2C_aristotele%2C_historia_animalium_e_altri_scritti%2C_xii_sec.%2C_pluteo_87%2C4.JPG.webp","url":"Aristotle's_biology"}
