{"title":"Atypical antipsychotic","summary":"The atypical antipsychotics (AAP), also known as second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) and serotoninâ€“dopamine antagonists (SDAs),[1][2] are a group of antipsychotic drugs (antipsychotic drugs in general are also known as major tranquilizers and neuroleptics, although the latter is usually reserved for the typical antipsychotics) largely introduced after the 1970s and used to treat psychiatric conditions. Some atypical antipsychotics have received regulatory approval (e.g. by the FDA of the US, the TGA of Australia, the MHRA of the UK) for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, and as an adjunct in major depressive disorder.","image":"Clozapine.svg.png.webp","url":"Atypical_antipsychotic"}
