{"title":"New York City English","summary":"New York City English, or Metropolitan New York English,[1] is a regional dialect of American English spoken by many people in New York City and much of its surrounding metropolitan area. Described by sociolinguist William Labov as the most recognizable regional dialect in North America,[2] its pronunciation system, the New York accent, is widely represented in American media with many public figures and fictional characters. Major features of the accent include a high, gliding /ɔ/ vowel (in words like talk and caught); a split of the \"short a\" vowel /æ/ into two separate sounds; variable dropping of r sounds; and a lack of the cot–caught, Mary–marry–merry, and hurry–furry mergers heard in many other American accents.","image":"Flag_of_New_York_City.svg.png.webp"}
