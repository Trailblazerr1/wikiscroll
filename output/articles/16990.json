{"title":"Free software","summary":"Free software (or libre software)[1][2] is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions.[3][4][5][6] Free software is a matter of liberty, not price; all users are legally free to do what they want with their copies of a free software (including profiting from them) regardless of how much is paid to obtain the program.[7][2] Computer programs are deemed \"free\" if they give end-users (not just the developer) ultimate control over the software and, subsequently, over their devices.[5][8]","image":"Desktop-Linux-Mint.png.webp"}
