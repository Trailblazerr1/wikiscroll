{"title":"Genome size","summary":"Genome size is the total amount of DNA contained within one copy of a single complete genome. It is typically measured in terms of mass in picograms (trillionths (10âˆ’12) of a gram, abbreviated pg) or less frequently in daltons, or as the total number of nucleotide base pairs, usually in megabases (millions of base pairs, abbreviated Mb or Mbp). One picogram is equal to 978 megabases.[1] In diploid organisms, genome size is often used interchangeably with the term C-value.","image":"Genome_Sizes.png.webp"}
