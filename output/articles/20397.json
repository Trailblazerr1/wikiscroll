{"title":"Historian","summary":"A historian is a person who studies and writes about the past and is regarded as an authority on it.[1] Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Some historians are recognized by publications or training and experience.[2]  \"Historian\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere.","image":"Herodotos_Met_91.8.jpg.webp"}
