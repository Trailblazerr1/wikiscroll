{"title":"Quantitative trait locus","summary":"A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a locus (section of DNA) that correlates with variation of a quantitative trait in the phenotype of a population of organisms.[1] QTLs are mapped by identifying which molecular markers (such as SNPs or AFLPs) correlate with an observed trait. This is often an early step in identifying and sequencing the actual genes that cause the trait variation.","image":"Example_of_QTL-Scan_on_a_single_Chromosom_from_PLoS_Biology.jpg.webp","url":"Quantitative_trait_locus"}
