{"title":"Tent","summary":"A tent (/t…õnt/ (listen)) is a shelter consisting of sheets of fabric or other material draped over, attached to a frame of poles or attached to a supporting rope. While smaller tents may be free-standing or attached to the ground, large tents are usually anchored using guy ropes tied to stakes or tent pegs. First used as portable homes by nomads, tents are now more often used for recreational camping and as temporary shelters.","image":"Tent_at_High_Shelf_Camp_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Tent"}
