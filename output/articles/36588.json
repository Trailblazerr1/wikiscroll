{"title":"Pyramid of Sahure","summary":"The Pyramid of Sahure (Egyptian: Ḫꜥỉ-bꜣ Sꜣḥw-Rꜥ \"The rising of the ba spirit of Sahure\") is a pyramid complex built in the late-26th-to-25th century BC for the Egyptian pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty.[10][lower-alpha 1] It introduced a period of pyramid building by Sahure's successors in Abusir, on a location earlier used by Userkaf for his sun temple. The site was first thoroughly excavated by Ludwig Borchardt between March 1907 and 1908, who wrote the standard work Das Grabdenkmal des Königs Sahu-Re (The Funerary Monument of King Sahure) between 1910 and 1913.","image":"Pyramide_de_Sahourê_Abousir.JPG.webp","url":"Pyramid_of_Sahure"}
