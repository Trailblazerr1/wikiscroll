{"title":"Lepidoptera","summary":"Lepidoptera (/ˌlɛpəˈdɒptərə/ lep-ə-DOP-tər-ə; from Ancient Greek  λεπίδος (lepídos) 'scale', and  πτερά (pterá) 'wings') is an order of insects that includes butterflies and moths (both are called lepidopterans). About 180,000 species of the Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families[1] and 46 superfamilies,[2] 10 percent of the total described species of living organisms.[2][3] It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world.[4] The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought,[5] and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera.[4]","image":"Peacock_butterfly_(Aglais_io)_2.jpg.webp"}
