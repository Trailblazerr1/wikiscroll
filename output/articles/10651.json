{"title":"Committee for Skeptical Inquiry","summary":"The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), formerly known as the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), is a program within the transnational American non-profit educational organization Center for Inquiry (CFI), which seeks to \"promote scientific inquiry, critical investigation, and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims.\"[1] Paul Kurtz proposed the establishment of CSICOP in 1976 as an independent non-profit organization (before merging with CFI as one of its programs in 2015[2]), to counter what he regarded as an uncritical acceptance of, and support for, paranormal claims by both the media and society in general.[3] Its philosophical position is one of scientific skepticism. CSI's fellows have included notable scientists, Nobel laureates, philosophers, psychologists, educators and authors.[4] It is headquartered in Amherst, New York.","image":"CSI_logo_new.png.webp","url":"Committee_for_Skeptical_Inquiry"}
