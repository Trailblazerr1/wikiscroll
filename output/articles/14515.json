{"title":"Elephant seal","summary":"Elephant seals are large, oceangoing earless seals in the genus Mirounga. The two species, the northern elephant seal (M. angustirostris) and the southern elephant seal (M. leonina), were both hunted to the brink of extinction by the end of the 19th century, but their numbers have since recovered. They are the largest extant carnivorans, weighing up to 4,000 kilograms (8,800Â lb).","image":"See_elefanten_edit.jpg.webp","url":"Elephant_seal"}
