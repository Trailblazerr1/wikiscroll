{"title":"Commuter town","summary":"A commuter town is a populated area that is primarily residential, rather than commercial or industrial. Routine travel from home to work and then from work to home is called commuting, which is where the term comes from. A commuter town may be called by many other terms: \"bedroom community\" (Canada and northeastern US), \"bedroom town\", \"bedroom suburb\" (US), \"dormitory town\", \"dormitory suburb\" or \"dormitory village\" (Britain/Commonwealth/Ireland). In Japan, a commuter town may be referred to with the wasei-eigo coinage \"bed town\" (ベッドタウン, beddotaun).[2] The term \"exurb\" was also used from the 1950s, but since 2006, is generally used for areas beyond suburbs and specifically less densely built than the suburbs to which the exurbs' residents commute.[3]","image":"Commuters_in_Maplewood_NJ.jpg.webp","url":"Commuter_town"}
