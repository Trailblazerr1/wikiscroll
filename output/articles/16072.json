{"title":"Fiber bundle","summary":"In mathematics, and particularly topology, a fiber bundle (or, in Commonwealth English: fibre bundle) is a space that is locally a product space, but globally may have a different topological structure. Specifically, the similarity between a space \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n and a product space \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        ×\n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B\\times F}\n  \n is defined using a continuous surjective map, \n  \n    \n      \n        π\n        :\n        E\n        →\n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi \\colon E\\to B}\n  \n, that in small regions of \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n        ×\n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B\\times F}\n  \n to \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n.  The map \n  \n    \n      \n        π\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\pi }\n  \n, called the projection or submersion of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle.  The space \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n is known as the total space of the fiber bundle, \n  \n    \n      \n        B\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle B}\n  \n as the base space, and \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F}\n  \n the fiber.","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg"}
