{"title":"Evolution of reptiles","summary":"Reptiles arose about 310â€“320 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. Reptiles, in the traditional sense of the term, are defined as animals that have scales or scutes, lay land-based hard-shelled eggs, and possess ectothermic metabolisms. So defined, the group is paraphyletic, excluding endothermic animals like birds and mammals that are descended from early traditionally-defined reptiles.  A definition in accordance with phylogenetic nomenclature, which rejects paraphyletic groups, includes birds while excluding mammals and their synapsid ancestors. So defined, Reptilia is identical to Sauropsida.","image":"Casineria_kiddi.jpg.webp","url":"Evolution_of_reptiles"}
