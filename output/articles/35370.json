{"title":"Polis","summary":"Polis (/ˈpɒlɪs/, US: /ˈpoʊlɪs/; Greek: πόλις, Ancient Greek pronunciation: [pólis]), plural poleis (/ˈpɒleɪz/, πόλεις, Ancient Greek pronunciation: [póleːs]), literally means \"city\" in Greek. In Ancient Greece, it originally referred to an administrative and religious city center, as distinct from the rest of the city.[1] Later, it also came to mean the body of citizens under a city's jurisdiction. In modern historiography, the term is normally used to refer to the ancient Greek city-states, such as Classical Athens and its contemporaries, and thus is often translated as \"city-state\". This term, a calque of the German Stadtstaat, does not fully translate the Greek term. The poleis were not like other primordial ancient city-states like Tyre or Sidon, which were ruled by a king or a small oligarchy; rather, they were political entities ruled by their bodies of citizens.","image":"Attica_06-13_Athens_50_View_from_Philopappos_-_Acropolis_Hill.jpg.webp","url":"Polis"}
