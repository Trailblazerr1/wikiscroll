{"title":"Migraine","summary":"A migraine (UK: /ˈmiːɡreɪn/, US: /ˈmaɪ-/)[12][13] is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurrent headaches that are moderate to severe.[1] Typically, episodes affect one side of the head, are pulsating in nature, and last from a few hours to three days.[1] Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smell.[2] The pain is generally made worse by physical activity,[14] although regular exercise may have prophylactic effects.[15] Up to one-third of people affected have aura: typically a short period of visual disturbance that signals that the headache will soon occur.[14] Occasionally, aura can occur with little or no headache following, but not everyone has this symptom.[16]","image":"Migraine.jpg.webp"}
