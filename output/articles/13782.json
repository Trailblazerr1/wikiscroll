{"title":"Dupuytren's contracture","summary":"Dupuytren's contracture (also called Dupuytren's disease, Morbus Dupuytren, Viking disease, and Celtic hand) is a condition in which one or more fingers become permanently bent in a flexed position.[2] It is named after Guillaume Dupuytren, who first described the underlying mechanism of action, followed by the first successful operation in 1831 and publication of the results in The Lancet in 1834.[6] It usually begins as small, hard nodules just under the skin of the palm,[2] then worsens over time until the fingers can no longer be straightened. While typically not painful, some aching or itching may be present.[2] The ring finger followed by the little and middle fingers are most commonly affected.[2] The condition can interfere with activities such as preparing food and writing.[2]","image":"Morbus_dupuytren_fcm.jpg.webp"}
