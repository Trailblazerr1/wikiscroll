{"title":"Blank Space","summary":"\"Blank Space\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from her fifth studio album, 1989. The song was released to US radio stations as the second single from 1989 on November 10, 2014, by Republic Records in partnership with Swift's label at the time, Big Machine. Swift co-wrote \"Blank Space\" with its producers Max Martin and Shellback. For the lyrics, she conceived the song as a satirical self-referential nod to her reputation as a flirtatious woman with a series of romantic attachments, which blemished her once-wholesome girl next door image. Musically, it is an electropop song with minimal hip hop-influenced beats.","image":"Taylor_Swift_-_Blank_Space_(Official_Single_Cover).png.webp"}
