{"title":"ADAC","summary":"ADAC (an acronym for Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil-Club; General German Automobile Club) is Europe's largest motoring association. It would be more aptly described today as an individual mobility association since it looks more broadly at all transport options ensuring individual mobility. Its headquarters is located in Munich.\nThe object of ADAC is “the representation, promotion and advocacy of motoring, motorsport and tourism interests.”[2] Its original and most well-known service is roadside assistance. The club also offers other products and services – directly or through subsidiaries, distributes city maps, road maps and road atlases and operates several driver safety centres. It works together closely with its Austrian counterpart ÖAMTC. Via its charitable subsidiary ADAC Luftrettung gGmbH, ADAC operates the largest fleet of ambulance helicopters in Germany. In 2019, the ADAC helicopters started into approx. 54,000 missions.","image":"ADAC-Logo.svg.png.webp"}
