{"title":"Operation Priboi","summary":"Operation Priboi (Russian: Операция «Прибой» – \"Operation 'Coastal Surf'\") was the code name for the Soviet mass deportation from the Baltic states on 25–28 March 1949. The action is also known as the March deportation (Estonian: Märtsiküüditamine; Latvian: Marta deportācijas; Russian: Мартовская депортация) by Baltic historians. More than 90,000 Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians, labeled as \"enemies of the people\", were deported to forced settlements in inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union. Over 70% of the deportees were either women or children under the age of 16.","image":"Priboi_planas.jpg.webp"}
