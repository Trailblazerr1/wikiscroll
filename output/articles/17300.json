{"title":"Gabriela Sabatini","summary":"Gabriela Beatriz Sabatini (Spanish pronunciation: [gaˈβɾjela saβaˈtini]; born 16 May 1970) is an Argentine former professional tennis player. She was one of the leading players from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, amassing 41 titles and achieving a career-high ranking of 3 in both singles and doubles. In singles, Sabatini won the 1990 US Open, the WTA Finals in 1988 and 1994, and was runner-up at Wimbledon 1991, the 1988 US Open and the silver medalist at the 1988 Olympics. In doubles, she won Wimbledon in 1988 with Steffi Graf, and reached three French Open finals. Among Open era players who did not reach world No. 1 themselves, Sabatini retains the record for accumulating the most wins over reigning world No. 1 ranked players.[1] In 2006, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and in 2018 Tennis Magazine ranked her as the 20th-greatest player of the preceding 50 years.","image":"Gabriela_Sabatini_US_Embassy_in_Argentina_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Gabriela_Sabatini"}
