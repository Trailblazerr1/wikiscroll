{"title":"Cashew","summary":"The cashew tree (Anacardium occidentale) is a tropical evergreen tree that produces the cashew seed and the cashew apple accessory fruit.[1][2] The tree can grow as high as 14 m (46 ft), but the dwarf cultivars, growing up to 6 m (20 ft), prove more profitable, with earlier maturity and greater yields. The cashew seed is commonly considered a snack nut (cashew nut) eaten on its own, used in recipes, or processed into cashew cheese or cashew butter.[3]  Like the tree, the nut is often simply called  cashew. Cashew allergies are triggered by the proteins found in tree nuts, and cooking often does not remove or change these proteins.","image":"Cashew_apples.jpg.webp","url":"Cashew"}
