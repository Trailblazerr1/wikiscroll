{"title":"Dhimmi","summary":"Dhimmī (Arabic: ذمي‎ ḏimmī, IPA: [ˈðimmiː], collectively أهل الذمة ahl aḏ-ḏimmah/dhimmah \"the people of the covenant\") or Mu'ahid is a historical[1] term for non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection.[1][2]: 470  The word literally means \"protected person\",[3] referring to the state's obligation under sharia to protect the individual's life, property, as well as freedom of religion, in exchange for loyalty to the state and payment of the jizya tax, in contrast to the zakat, or obligatory alms, paid by the Muslim subjects.[4] Dhimmi were exempt from certain duties assigned specifically to Muslims if they paid the poll tax (jizya) but were otherwise equal under the laws of property, contract, and obligation.[5][6][7]","image":"ALFiqh.png.webp","url":"Dhimmi"}
