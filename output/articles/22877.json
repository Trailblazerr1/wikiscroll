{"title":"Jamaica at the 2008 Summer Olympics","summary":"Jamaica sent a delegation to compete at the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, China from August 8 to August 24, 2008. This was, by far, Jamaica's best showing at the Summer Olympics; it was the nation's largest delegation yet, and its athletes nearly doubled its total gold medal count in addition to breaking the nation's record for number of medals earned in a single games. Jamaica's appearance at Beijing was its fifteenth consecutive appearance and appearance as an independent nation, although it had previously participated in four other games (including its 1948 debut) as a British colony and as part of the West Indies Federation. In the 29 events that included Jamaican athletes, there were 26 cases in which a Jamaican athlete or relay progressed to a final round. Usain Bolt won three of Jamaica's six gold medals at Beijing, breaking an Olympic and world record in all three of the events in which he participated.  Shelly-Ann Fraser led an unprecedented Jamaican sweep of the medals in the Women's 100 m.  Female sprinter Veronica Campbell-Brown carried Jamaica's flag at the ceremonies.","image":"Flag_of_Jamaica.svg.png.webp"}
