{"title":"Romansh language","summary":"Romansh (/roʊˈmænʃ, roʊˈmɑːnʃ/; sometimes also spelled Romansch and Rumantsch; Sursilvan: romontsch [ʁoˈmɔntʃ] (listen); Vallader, Surmiran, and Rumantsch Grischun: rumantsch [rʊˈmantʃ] (listen); Putèr: rumauntsch [rʊˈmɛntʃ] (listen); Sutsilvan: rumàntsch [rʊˈmantʃ], [rʊˈmaʊ̯ntʃ], [rəˈmœntʃ]; Jauer: [rʊˈmaʊ̯ntʃ]) is a Romance language spoken predominantly in the Swiss canton of the Grisons (Graubünden). Romansh has been recognized as a national language of Switzerland since 1938, and as an official language in correspondence with Romansh-speaking citizens since 1996, along with German, French, and Italian.[6] It also has official status in the canton of the Grisons alongside German and Italian and is used as the medium of instruction in schools in Romansh-speaking areas. It is sometimes grouped by linguists with Ladin and Friulian as the Rhaeto-Romance languages, though this is disputed.","image":"Romansh_language_composite.png.webp","url":"Romansh_language"}
