{"title":"Directive (European Union)","summary":"A directive is a legal act of the European Union[1] that requires member states to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. Directives first have to be enacted into national law by member states before their laws are ruling on individuals residing in their countries.[2] Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted. Directives can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter.","image":"Flag_of_Europe.svg.png.webp","url":"Directive_(European_Union)"}
