{"title":"Thalamus","summary":"The thalamus (from Greek θάλαμος, \"chamber\")[1] is a large mass of gray matter located in the dorsal part of the diencephalon (a division of the forebrain). Nerve fibers project out of the thalamus to the cerebral cortex in all directions, allowing hub-like exchanges of information. It has several functions, such as the relaying of sensory signals, including motor signals to the cerebral cortex[2][3] and the regulation of consciousness, sleep, and alertness.[4]","image":"Brain_chrischan_thalamus.jpg.webp","url":"Thalamus"}
