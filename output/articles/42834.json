{"title":"Supercontinent","summary":"In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass.[1][2][3] However, some earth scientists use a different definition, \"a grouping of formerly dispersed continents\", which leaves room for interpretation and is easier to apply to Precambrian times[4] although at least about 75% of the continental crust then in existence has been proposed as a limit to separate supercontinents from other groupings.[5]","image":"Afro-Eurasia.png.webp"}
