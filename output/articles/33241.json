{"title":"Ordinary differential equation","summary":"In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and the derivatives of those functions.[1] The term ordinary is used in contrast with the term partial differential equation which may be with respect to more than one independent variable.[2]","image":"Navier_Stokes_Laminar.svg.png.webp","url":"Ordinary_differential_equation"}
