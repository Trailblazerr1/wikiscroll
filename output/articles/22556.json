{"title":"Isle of Skye","summary":"The Isle of Skye,[9] or simply Skye (/skaɪ/; Scottish Gaelic: An t-Eilean Sgitheanach or Eilean a' Cheò; Scots: Isle o Skye), is the largest and northernmost of the major islands in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland.[Note 1] The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous hub dominated by the Cuillin, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country.[11][12] Although it has been suggested that Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
