{"title":"Akamai Technologies","summary":"Akamai Technologies, Inc. is an American content delivery network[2] (CDN), cybersecurity, and cloud service company, providing web and Internet security services.[3][4] Akamai's Intelligent Edge Platform[5] is one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms. The company operates a network of servers around the world and rents out capacity on these servers to customers who want their websites to work faster by distributing content from locations near the user. When a user navigates to the URL of an Akamai customer, their browser is directed by Akamai's domain name system[6] to a proximal edge server that can serve the requested content. Akamai's mapping system[7] assigns each user to a proximal edge server using sophisticated algorithms[8] such as stable matching and consistent hashing, enabling more reliable and faster web downloads. Further, Akamai implements DDoS mitigation and other security services[9] in its edge server platform.","image":"Akamai_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Akamai_Technologies"}
