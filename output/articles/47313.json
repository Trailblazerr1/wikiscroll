It is sometimes known in English as the European wasp, but the same name is used for the species Vespula germanica or German wasp. Another name for Vespula vulgaris is the common yellow-jacket.[2][3] In 2010, the ostensible Vespula vulgaris wasps in North America were found to be a different species, Vespula alascensis.[4]","image":"Vespula_vulgaris_queen.jpg.webp","url":"Vespula_vulgaris"}
