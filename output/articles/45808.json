{"title":"Transposable element","summary":"A transposable element (TE, transposon, or jumping gene) is a DNA sequence that can change its position within a genome, sometimes creating or reversing mutations and altering the cell's genetic identity and genome size.[1] Transposition often results in duplication of the same genetic material. Barbara McClintock's discovery of them earned her a Nobel Prize in 1983.[2]","image":"Composite_transposon.svg.png.webp","url":"Transposable_element"}
