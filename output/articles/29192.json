{"title":"Medusa","summary":"In Greek mythology, Medusa (/mɪˈdjuːzə, -sə/; Ancient Greek: Μέδουσα \"guardian, protectress\")[1] also called Gorgo, was one of the three  monstrous Gorgons, generally described as winged human females with living venomous snakes in place of hair.  Those who gazed into her eyes would turn to stone. Most sources describe her as the daughter of Phorcys and Ceto,[2] although the author Hyginus makes her the daughter of Gorgon and Ceto.[3]","image":"Gorgona_pushkin.jpg.webp","url":"Medusa"}
