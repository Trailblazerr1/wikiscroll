{"title":"North American fur trade","summary":"The North American fur trade refers to the commercial trade in furs in North America. Various indigenous people of the Americas traded furs with other tribes during the pre-Columbian era. Europeans started their participation in the North American fur trade from the initial period of their colonization of the Americas onward, extending the trade's reach to Europe. European merchants from France, England and the Dutch Republic established trading posts and forts in various regions of North America to conduct the trade with local indigenous tribes. The trade reached the peak of its economic importance in the 19th century, by which time it relied upon elaborately developed trade networks.","image":"Fur_traders_in_canada_1777.jpg.webp","url":"North_American_fur_trade"}
