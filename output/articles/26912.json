{"title":"List of most-viewed YouTube videos","summary":"YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. Although the most-viewed videos were initially viral videos, such as \"Evolution of Dance\" and \"Charlie Bit My Finger\", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to music videos. Since Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" in 2009, every video that has reached the top of the \"most-viewed YouTube videos\" list has been a music video. Some of the previously most-viewed videos are no longer listed on the site.","image":"0fff2b101c927208f715974044a787aa.png.webp"}
