{"title":"Whipped cream","summary":"Whipped cream is liquid heavy cream that is whipped by a whisk or mixer until it is light and fluffy and holds its shape, or by the expansion of dissolved gas, forming a firm colloid. It is often sweetened, typically with white sugar, and sometimes flavored with vanilla. Whipped cream is also called Chantilly cream (or crème Chantilly; pronounced [kʁɛm ʃɑ̃tiji]).","image":"Kakao_mit_Sahne_281104.jpg.webp"}
