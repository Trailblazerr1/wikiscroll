{"title":"Time standard","summary":"A time standard is a specification for measuring time: either the rate at which time passes or points in time or both.  In modern times, several time specifications have been officially recognized as standards, where formerly they were matters of custom and practice.  An example of a kind of time standard can be a time scale, specifying a method for measuring divisions of time.  A standard for civil time can specify both time intervals and time-of-day.","image":"Wooden_hourglass_3.jpg.webp","url":"Time_standard"}
