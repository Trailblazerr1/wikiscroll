{"title":"Interstate 80 in Iowa","summary":"Interstate 80 (I-80) is a transcontinental Interstate Highway in the United States, stretching from San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey.  In Iowa, the highway travels west to east through the center of the state.  It enters the state at the Missouri River in Council Bluffs and heads east through the southern Iowa drift plain.  In the Des Moines area, I-80 meets up with I-35 and the two routes bypass Des Moines together.  On the northern side of Des Moines, the Interstates split and I-80 continues east.  In eastern Iowa, it provides access to the University of Iowa in Iowa City. Northwest of the Quad Cities in Walcott is IowaÂ 80, the world's largest truck stop. I-80 passes along the northern edge of Davenport and Bettendorf and leaves Iowa via the Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge over the Mississippi River into Illinois.","image":"I-80_(IA).svg.png.webp"}
