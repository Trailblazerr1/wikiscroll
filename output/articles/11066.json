{"title":"Continuous function","summary":"In mathematics, a continuous function is a function that does not have any abrupt changes in value, known as discontinuities. More precisely, a function is continuous if arbitrarily small changes in its output can be assured by restricting to sufficiently small changes in its input. If not continuous, a function is said to be discontinuous. Up until the 19th century, mathematicians largely relied on intuitive notions of continuity, during which attempts such as the epsilonâ€“delta definition were made to formalize it.","image":"2311a6a75c54b0ea085a381ba472c31d59321514.svg","url":"Continuous_function"}
