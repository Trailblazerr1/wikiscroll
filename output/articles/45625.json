{"title":"Toxic masculinity","summary":"The concept of toxic masculinity is used in academic and media discussions of masculinity to refer to certain cultural norms that are associated with harm to society and men themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered \"toxic\" due in part to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. The socialization of boys in patriarchal societies often normalizes violence, such as in the saying \"boys will be boys\" about bullying and aggression.","image":"I_Won't_Cry_Daddy.jpg.webp","url":"Toxic_masculinity"}
