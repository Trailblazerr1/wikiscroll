{"title":"Beta distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] parameterized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by α and β, that appear as exponents of the random variable and control the shape of the distribution. The generalization to multiple variables is called a Dirichlet distribution.","image":"Beta_distribution_pdf.svg.png.webp","url":"Beta_distribution"}
