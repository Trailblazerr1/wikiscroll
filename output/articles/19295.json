{"title":"HMS Courageous (50)","summary":"HMS Courageous was the lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by First Sea Lord John Fisher, the ship was very lightly armoured and armed with only a few heavy guns. Courageous was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea. She participated in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later.","image":"HMS_Courageous_WWI.jpg.webp","url":"HMS_Courageous_(50)"}
