{"title":"Cartridge (firearms)","summary":"A cartridge[1][2] or a round is a type of pre-assembled firearm ammunition packaging a projectile (bullet, shot, or slug), a propellant substance (usually either smokeless powder or black powder) and an ignition device (primer) within a metallic, paper, or plastic case that is precisely made to fit within the barrel chamber of a breechloading gun, for the practical purpose of convenient transportation and handling during shooting.[3] Although in popular usage the term \"bullet\" is often informally used to refer to a complete cartridge, it is correctly used only to refer to the projectile.","image":"Cartridge_cross_section.svg.png.webp"}
