{"title":"Río de la Plata","summary":"The Río de la Plata (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈri.o ðe la ˈplata] (listen), lit. \"river of silver\"), called River Plate in British English and the Commonwealth and La Plata River (occasionally Plata River) in other English-speaking countries, is the estuary formed by the confluence of the Uruguay River and the Paraná River at Punta Gorda. It empties into the Atlantic Ocean and forms a funnel-shaped indentation on the southeastern coastline of South America. Depending on the geographer, the Río de la Plata may be considered a river, an estuary, a gulf, or a marginal sea.[3] If considered a river, it is the widest in the world, with a maximum width of 220 kilometres (140 mi).","image":"Río_de_la_Plata_costa_norte_21.JPG.webp","url":"A%2fRío_de_la_Plata"}
