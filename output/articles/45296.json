{"title":"Titanic II","summary":"Titanic II is a planned passenger ocean liner intended to be a functional modern-day replica of the Olympic-class RMSÂ Titanic. The new ship is planned to have a gross tonnage (GT) of 56,000, while the original ship measured about 46,000 gross register tons (GRT).[note 1] The project was announced by Australian billionaire Clive Palmer in April 2012 as the flagship of the proposed cruise company Blue Star Line Pty. Ltd. of Brisbane, Australia.[3] The intended launch date was originally set in 2016,[4] delayed to 2018,[5] then 2022.[6] The development of the project was resumed in November 2018 after a hiatus which began in 2015, caused by a financial dispute[7][8] that affected the $500 million project.[9]","image":"Titanic_II.jpg.webp"}
