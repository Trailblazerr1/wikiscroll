{"title":"Nastaliq","summary":"Nastaʼlīq (/ˌnæstəˈliːk, ˈnæstəliːk/;[8] Persian: نستعلیق‎, IPA: [næsˈtæʔliːq]) is one of the main calligraphic hands used to write the Perso-Arabic script in the Persian and Urdu languages,[9] and traditionally the predominant style in Persian calligraphy.[10] It was developed in the land of Persia (modern-day Iran) in the 14th and 15th centuries.[11] It is sometimes used to write Arabic language text (where it is mainly used for titles and headings), but its use has always been more popular in the Persian, Urdu and Turkic sphere of influence. Nastaliq remains very widely used in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan and other countries for written poetry and as a form of art.[12]","image":"Welcome_to_Persian_Wikipedia.svg.png.webp"}
