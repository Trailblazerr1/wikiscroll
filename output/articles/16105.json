{"title":"Field extension","summary":"In mathematics, particularly in algebra, a field extension is a pair of fields \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        âŠ†\n        F\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E\\subseteq F,}\n  \n such that the operations of E are those of F restricted to E. In this case, F is an extension field of E and E is a subfield of F.[1][2][3] For example, under the usual notions of addition and multiplication, the complex numbers are an extension field of the real numbers; the real numbers are a subfield of the complex numbers.","image":"be8932e3dd0f0f144b6c6fbb088fe21a08640ad8.svg"}
