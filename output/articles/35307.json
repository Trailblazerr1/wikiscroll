{"title":"Poikilotherm","summary":"A poikilotherm (/ˈpɔɪkələˌθɜːrm, pɔɪˈkɪləˌθɜːrm/) is an animal whose internal temperature varies considerably. Poikilotherms have to survive and adapt to environmental stress.[1] One of the most important stressors is temperature change, which can lead to alterations in membrane lipid order and can cause protein unfolding and denaturation at elevated temperatures.[1] It is the opposite of a homeotherm, an animal which maintains thermal homeostasis. While the term in principle can apply to all organisms, it is generally only applied to animals, and mostly to vertebrates. Usually the fluctuations are consequence of variation in the ambient environmental temperature. Many terrestrial ectotherms are poikilothermic.[2] However some ectotherms remain in temperature-constant environments to the point that they are actually able to maintain a constant internal temperature (i.e. are homeothermic). It is this distinction that often makes the term \"poikilotherm\" more useful than the vernacular \"cold-blooded\", which is sometimes used to refer to ectotherms more generally.","image":"Wiki_ostrich.jpg.webp","url":"Poikilotherm"}
