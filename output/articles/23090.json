{"title":"Jarrow March","summary":"The Jarrow March of 5â€“31 October 1936, also known as the Jarrow Crusade,[n 1] was an organised protest against the unemployment and poverty suffered in the English town of Jarrow during the 1930s. Around 200 men (or \"Crusaders\" as they preferred to be referred to) marched from Jarrow to London, carrying a petition to the British government requesting the re-establishment of industry in the town following the closure in 1934 of its main employer, Palmer's shipyard. The petition was received by the House of Commons but not debated, and the march produced few immediate results. The Jarrovians went home believing that they had failed.","image":"Jarrow_Marchers_en_route_to_London_(3084877308).jpg.webp"}
