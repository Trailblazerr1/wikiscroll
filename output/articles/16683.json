{"title":"Forgiveness","summary":"Forgiveness, in a psychological sense, is the intentional and voluntary process by which one who may initially feel victimized, undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding a given offense, and overcomes [1][2][3] negative emotions such as resentment and vengeance (however justified it might be). Theorists differ, however, in the extent to which they believe forgiveness also implies replacing the negative emotions with positive attitudes (i.e. an increased ability to wish the offender well).[4][5][6] In certain legal contexts, forgiveness is a term for absolving or giving up all claims on account of debt, loan, obligation, or other claims.[7][8]","image":"Marco_aurelio_e_barbaros_-_museus_capitolinos.jpg.webp","url":"Forgiveness"}
