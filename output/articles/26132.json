{"title":"Ligand (biochemistry)","summary":"In biochemistry and pharmacology, a ligand is a substance that forms a complex with a biomolecule to serve a biological purpose. The etymology stems from ligare, which means 'to bind'. In protein-ligand binding, the ligand is usually a molecule which produces a signal by binding to a site on a target protein.  The binding typically results in a change of conformational isomerism (conformation) of the target protein. In DNA-ligand binding studies, the ligand can be a small molecule, ion,[1] or protein[2] which binds to the DNA double helix.  The relationship between ligand and binding partner is a function of charge, hydrophobicity, and molecular structure.  The instance of binding occurs over an infinitesimal range of time and space, so the rate constant is usually a very small number.","image":"Myoglobin_and_heme.png.webp"}
