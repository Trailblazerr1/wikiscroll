{"title":"Charter Oath","summary":"The Charter Oath (五箇条の御誓文, Gokajō no Goseimon, more literally, the Oath in Five Articles) was promulgated on 6 April 1868 in Kyoto Imperial Palace.[1][2] The Oath outlined the main aims and the course of action to be followed during Emperor Meiji's reign, setting the legal stage for Japan's modernization. This also set up a process of urbanization as people of all classes were free to move jobs so people went to the city for better work. It remained influential, if less for governing than inspiring, throughout the Meiji era and into the twentieth century, and can be considered  the first constitution of modern Japan.[3]","image":"5jo1.gif","url":"Charter_Oath"}
