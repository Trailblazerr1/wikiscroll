{"title":"Book of Wisdom","summary":"The Book of Wisdom, or the Wisdom of Solomon, is a Jewish work written in Greek and most likely composed in Alexandria, Egypt. Generally dated to the mid-first century BC,[1] the central theme of the work is \"Wisdom\" itself, appearing under two principal aspects. In its relation to man, Wisdom is the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. In direct relation to God, Wisdom is with God from all eternity.[2] It is one of the seven Sapiential or wisdom books in the Septuagint, the others being Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs (Song of Solomon), Job, and Sirach. It is included in the deuterocanonical books by the Catholic Church and the anagignoskomena (Gr. ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, meaning \"those which are to be read\") of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Most Protestants consider it part of the Apocrypha.","image":"Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg.webp"}
