{"title":"Ergotism","summary":"Ergotism (pron. /ˈɜːrɡətˌɪzəm/ UR-gət-iz-əm) is the effect of long-term ergot poisoning, traditionally due to the ingestion of the alkaloids produced by the Claviceps purpurea fungus—from the Latin noun clava meaning \"club\" and the suffix -ceps meaning \"head\", i.e. the purple club-headed fungus—that infects rye and other cereals, and more recently by the action of a number of ergoline-based drugs. It is also known as ergotoxicosis, ergot poisoning, and Saint Anthony's fire.","image":"lossy-page1-300px-Barger.TIF.jpg.webp","url":"Ergotism"}
