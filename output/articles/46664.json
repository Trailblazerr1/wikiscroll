{"title":"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","summary":"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an international environmental treaty to combat \"dangerous human interference with the climate system\", in part by stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.[1]  It was signed by 154 states at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992.  It established a Secretariat headquartered in Bonn and entered into force on 21 March 1994.[2]  The treaty called for ongoing scientific research and regular meetings, negotiations, and future policy agreements designed to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.[2][3]","image":"UNFCCC_logo.svg.png.webp"}
