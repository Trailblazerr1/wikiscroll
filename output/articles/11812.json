{"title":"Cydonia (Mars)","summary":"Cydonia (/sɪˈdoʊniə/, /saɪˈdoʊniə/) is a region on the planet Mars that has attracted both scientific[1] and popular interest.[2][3] The name originally referred to the albedo feature (distinctively coloured area) that was visible from earthbound telescopes. The area borders the plains of Acidalia Planitia and the Arabia Terra highlands.[4] The area includes the regions: \"Cydonia Mensae\", an area of flat-topped mesa-like features, \"Cydonia Colles\", a region of small hills or knobs, and \"Cydonia Labyrinthus\", a complex of intersecting valleys.[5][6] As with other albedo features on Mars, the name Cydonia was drawn from classical antiquity, in this case from Cydonia or Kydonia (Ancient Greek: Κυδωνία; Latin: Cydonia), a historic polis (city state) on the island of Crete.[7]\nCydonia contains the \"Face on Mars\", located about halfway between Arandas Crater and Bamberg Crater.[4]","image":"Martian_face_viking.jpg.webp"}
