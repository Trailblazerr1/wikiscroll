{"title":"James IV of Scotland","summary":"James IV (17 March 1473 – 9 September 1513) was King of Scotland from 11 June 1488 until his death in battle in 1513. He assumed the throne following the death of his father King James III (r. 1460–1488) at the Battle of Sauchieburn, a rebellion in which the younger James played an indirect role. He is generally regarded as the most successful of the Stewart monarchs of Scotland, but his reign ended in a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Flodden.  He was the last monarch from Great Britain to be killed in battle.","image":"James_IV_of_Scotland.jpg.webp","url":"James_IV_of_Scotland"}
