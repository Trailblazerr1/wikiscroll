{"title":"Ampère's circuital law","summary":"In classical electromagnetism, Ampère's circuital law (not to be confused with Ampère's force law that André-Marie Ampère discovered in 1823)[1] relates the integrated magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop. James Clerk Maxwell (not Ampère) derived it using hydrodynamics in his 1861 published paper \"On Physical Lines of Force\"[2] In 1865 he generalized the equation to apply to time-varying currents by adding the displacement current term, resulting in the modern form of the law, sometimes called the Ampère–Maxwell law,[3][4][5] which is one of Maxwell's equations which form the basis of classical electromagnetism.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp","url":"Ampère's_circuital_law"}
