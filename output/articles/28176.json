{"title":"Mali Empire","summary":"The Mali Empire (Manding: Mandé[4] or Manden; Arabic: مالي‎, romanized: Mālī) was an empire in West Africa from c. 1235 to 1670. The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita (c. 1214 – c. 1255) and became renowned for the wealth of its rulers, especially Mansa Musa (Musa Keita). The Manding languages were spoken in the empire. At its peak, Mali was the largest empire in West Africa, profoundly and widely influencing the culture of the region through the spread of its language, laws and customs.[5] Much of the recorded information about the Mali Empire comes from 14th-century North African historian Ibn Khaldun, 14th-century Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta and 16th-century Moroccan traveller Leo Africanus. The other major source of information is Mandinka oral tradition, as recorded by storytellers known as griots.[6]","image":"Flag_of_the_Mali_Empire.svg.png.webp","url":"Mali_Empire"}
