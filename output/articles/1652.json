{"title":"XMPP","summary":"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP, originally named Jabber[1]) is an open communication protocol designed for instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance.[2] Based on XML (Extensible Markup Language), it enables the near-real-time exchange of structured data between two or more network entities.[3] Designed to be extensible, the protocol offers a multitude of applications beyond traditional IM in the broader realm of message-oriented middleware, including signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming and other uses.","image":"XMPP_logo.svg.png.webp"}
