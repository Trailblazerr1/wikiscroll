{"title":"Ramlila","summary":"Ramlila (Rāmlīlā) (literally 'Rama’s lila or play') is any dramatic folk re-enactment of the life of Rama according to the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana or secondary literature based on it such as the Ramcharitmanas.[1] It particularly refers to the thousands[2] of Hindu god Rama-related dramatic plays and dance events, that are staged during the annual autumn festival of Navratri in India.[3] After the enactment of the legendary war between Good and Evil, the Ramlila celebrations climax in the Dussehra (Dasara, Vijayadashami) night festivities where the giant grotesque effigies of Evil such as of demon Ravana are burnt, typically with fireworks.[4][5][6]","image":"Ramnnagar_Varanasi_Ramlila.jpg.webp","url":"Ramlila"}
