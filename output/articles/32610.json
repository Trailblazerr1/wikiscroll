{"title":"OLED","summary":"An organic light-emitting diode (OLED or organic LED), also known as organic electroluminescent (organic EL) diode,[1][2] is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound that emits light in response to an electric current. This organic layer is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, and portable systems such as smartphones and handheld game consoles. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.[3][4][5]","image":"OEL_right.JPG.webp","url":"OLED"}
