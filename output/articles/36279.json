{"title":"Prostaglandin","summary":"The prostaglandins (PG) are a group of physiologically active lipid compounds called eicosanoids[1] having diverse hormone-like effects in animals.  Prostaglandins have been found in almost every tissue in humans and other animals. They are derived enzymatically from the fatty acid arachidonic acid.[2] Every prostaglandin contains 20 carbon atoms, including a 5-carbon ring. They are a subclass of eicosanoids and of the prostanoid class of fatty acid derivatives.","image":"Prostaglandin_E1.svg.png.webp"}
