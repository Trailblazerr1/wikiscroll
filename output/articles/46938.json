{"title":"Usage share of operating systems","summary":"The usage share of operating systems is the percentage of computing devices that run each operating system (OS) at any particular time.

Operating systems are used in numerous device types, from embedded devices without a screen through to supercomputers.","image":"Increase2.svg.png.webp"}
