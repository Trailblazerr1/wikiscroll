{"title":"Talk show","summary":"A talk show (or chat show in British English) is a television programming or radio programming genre structured around the act of spontaneous conversation.[1][2][3] A talk show is distinguished from other television programs by certain common attributes.[4] In a talk show, one person (or group of people or guests) discusses various topics put forth by a talk show host.[5] This discussion can be in the form of an interview or a simple conversation about important social, political or religious issues and events.[6] The personality of the host shapes the tone of the show, which also defines the \"trademark\" of the show.[1][7] A common feature or unwritten rule of talk shows is to be based on \"fresh talk\", which is talk that is spontaneous or has the appearance of spontaneity.[1][3][7]","image":"Lady_Night_1.png.webp","url":"Talk_show"}
