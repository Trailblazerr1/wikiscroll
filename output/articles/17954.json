{"title":"Germans","summary":"Germans (German: Deutsche, pronounced [ˈdɔɪ̯t͡ʃə] (listen)) are the natives or inhabitants of Germany, and sometimes more broadly any people who are of German descent or native speakers of the German language.[9][10] The constitution of Germany defines a German as a German citizen.[11] During the 19th and much of the 20th century, discussions on German identity were dominated by concepts of a common language, culture, descent and history.[12] Today, the German language is widely seen as the primary though not exclusive criterion of German identity.[13]  Estimates on the total number of Germans in the world range from 100 to 150 million, and most of them live in Germany.[14]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
