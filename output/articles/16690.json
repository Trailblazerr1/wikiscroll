{"title":"Formal grammar","summary":"In formal language theory, a grammar (when the context is not given, often called a formal grammar for clarity) describes how to form strings from a language's alphabet that are valid according to the language's syntax. A grammar does not describe the meaning of the strings or what can be done with them in whatever contextâ€”only their form. A formal grammar is defined as a set of production rules for such strings in a formal language.","image":"148a47440ef7233f89bec3dab3f99e3a37d7a22b.svg","url":"Formal_grammar"}
