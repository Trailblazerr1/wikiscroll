{"title":"River Forth","summary":"The River Forth is a major river in central Scotland, 47 km (29 mi) long, which drains into the North Sea on the east coast of the country. Its drainage basin covers much of Stirlingshire in Scotland's Central Belt.[1] The Gaelic name for the upper reach of the river, above Stirling, is Abhainn Dubh, meaning \"black river\". The name for the river below the tidal reach[2] (just past where it is crossed by the M9 motorway) is Uisge For.","image":"River_Forth_near_Stirling.jpg.webp","url":"River_Forth"}
