{"title":"Accelerometer","summary":"An accelerometer is a tool that measures proper acceleration.[1] Proper acceleration is the acceleration (the rate of change of velocity) of a body in its own instantaneous rest frame;[2] this is different from coordinate acceleration, which is acceleration in a fixed coordinate system. For example, an accelerometer at rest on the surface of the Earth will measure an acceleration due to Earth's gravity, straight upwards[3] (by definition) of g ≈ 9.81 m/s2. By contrast, accelerometers in free fall (falling toward the center of the Earth at a rate of about 9.81 m/s2) will measure zero.","image":"Motorola_Xoom_-_Kionix_KXTF9-1171.jpg.webp"}
