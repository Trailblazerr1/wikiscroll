{"title":"Ladislaus I of Hungary","summary":"Ladislaus I or Ladislas I, also Saint Ladislaus or Saint Ladislas (Hungarian: Szent László, Croatian: Ladislav I., Slovak: Svätý Ladislav, Polish: Władysław I Święty; c. 1040 – 29 July 1095) was King of Hungary from 1077 and King of Croatia from 1091. He was the second son of King Béla I of Hungary. After Béla's death in 1063, Ladislaus and his elder brother, Géza, acknowledged their cousin Solomon as the lawful king in exchange for receiving their father's former duchy, which included one-third of the kingdom. They cooperated with Solomon for the next decade. Ladislaus's most popular legend, which narrates his fight with a \"Cuman\" (a Turkic nomad marauder) who abducted a Hungarian girl, is connected to this period. The brothers' relationship with Solomon deteriorated in the early 1070s, and they rebelled against him. Géza was proclaimed king in 1074, but Solomon maintained control of the western regions of his kingdom. During Géza's reign, Ladislaus was his brother's most influential adviser.","image":"Ladislaus_I_(Chronica_Hungarorum).jpg.webp","url":"Ladislaus_I_of_Hungary"}
