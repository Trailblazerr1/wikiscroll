{"title":"Copyright law of the United States","summary":"The Copyright Law of the United States grants monopoly protection for \"original works of authorship\".[1][2] With the stated purpose to promote art and culture, copyright law assigns a set of exclusive rights to authors: to make and sell copies of their works, to create derivative works, and to perform or display their works publicly. These exclusive rights are subject to a time limit, and generally expire 70 years after the author's death or 95 years after publication. In the United States, works published before January 1, 1926, are in the public domain.","image":"Newspaper_advert_copyright_patent_and_trade_mark.jpg.webp","url":"Copyright_law_of_the_United_States"}
