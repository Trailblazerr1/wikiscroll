{"title":"Baker Island","summary":"Baker Island (previously New Nantucket[1]) is an uninhabited atoll just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean about 3,090 km (1,920 mi) southwest of Honolulu. The island lies almost halfway between Hawaii and Australia. Its nearest neighbor is Howland Island, 42 mi (68 km) to the north-northwest; both have been claimed as territories of the United States since 1857, though the United Kingdom considered them part of the British Empire between 1897 and 1936.","image":"Nwrbakerisle_a320.gif"}
