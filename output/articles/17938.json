{"title":"German cruiser Prinz Eugen","summary":"Prinz Eugen (German pronunciation: [ˈpʁɪnts ɔʏˈɡeːn]) was an  Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruiser, the third of a class of five vessels. She served with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The ship was laid down in April 1936, launched in August 1938, and entered service after the outbreak of war, in August 1940. She was named after Prince Eugene of Savoy, an 18th-century general in the service of Austria. She was armed with a main battery of eight 20.3 cm (8 in) guns and, although nominally under the 10,000-long-ton (10,160 t) limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, actually displaced over 16,000 long tons (16,257 t).","image":"PE_Atomtest_1.jpg.webp","url":"German_cruiser_Prinz_Eugen"}
