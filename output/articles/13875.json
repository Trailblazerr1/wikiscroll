{"title":"Déjà vu","summary":"Déjà vu (/ˌdeɪʒɑː ˈv(j)uː/ (listen)[1][2] DAY-zhah-VOO, -⁠VEW, French: [deʒa vy] (listen); \"already seen\") is a borrowed French word expressing the feeling that one has lived through the present situation before.[3][4][5][6] Although some interpret déjà vu in a paranormal context,[7] mainstream scientific approaches reject the explanation of déjà vu as \"precognition\" or \"prophecy\".[3][4][5][6] It is an anomaly of memory whereby, despite the strong sense of recollection, the time, place, and practical context of the \"previous\" experience are uncertain or believed to be impossible.[8][9][10] Two types of déjà vu are recognized: the pathological déjà vu usually associated with epilepsy or that which, when unusually prolonged or frequent, or associated with other symptoms such as hallucinations, may be an indicator of neurological or psychiatric illness,[11] and the non-pathological type characteristic of healthy people, about two-thirds of whom have had déjà vu experiences.[12][13][14][15][16] People who travel often or frequently watch films are more likely to experience déjà vu than others.[17] Furthermore, people also tend to experience déjà vu more in fragile conditions or under high pressure, and research shows that the experience of déjà vu also decreases with age.[18]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Déjà_vu"}
