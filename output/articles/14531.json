{"title":"Eli Wallach","summary":"Eli Herschel Wallach (/ˈiːlaɪ ˈwɒlək/; December 7, 1915 – June 24, 2014) was an American film, television and stage actor whose career spanned more than seven decades, beginning in the late 1940s. Trained in stage acting, which he enjoyed doing most, he became \"one of the greatest 'character actors' ever to appear on stage and screen\",[1] with over 90 film credits. He and his wife Anne Jackson often appeared together on stage, and were one of the best-known acting couples in American theater. As a stage and screen character actor, Wallach had one of the longest-ever careers in show business, spanning 62 years from his Broadway debut to his last two major Hollywood studio movies (which were released in the same year).","image":"Eli_Wallach_-_publicity.jpg.webp","url":"Eli_Wallach"}
