{"title":"Off the Deep End","summary":"Off the Deep End is the seventh studio album by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, released in 1992. This album was the first album self-produced by Yankovic, after six albums with Rick Derringer. Recorded between June 1990 and January 1992, the album was a follow-up to the unsuccessful soundtrack to Yankovic's 1989 film UHF. Off the Deep End and its lead single \"Smells Like Nirvana\" helped to revitalize Yankovic's career after a lull following his last hit single, \"Fat\", in 1988.","image":"Weird_Al_Yankovic_-_Off_the_Deep_End.jpg.webp"}
