{"title":"David Pearson (racing driver)","summary":"David Gene Pearson (December 22, 1934 â€“ November 12, 2018) was an American stock car driver, who raced from 1960 to 1986 in the former NASCAR Grand National and Winston Cup Series (now called the NASCAR Cup Series), most notably driving the No. 21 Mercury for Wood Brothers Racing. Pearson won the 1960 NASCAR Rookie of the Year award[2] and three Cup Series championships (1966, 1968, and 1969). He never missed a race in the years he was active.[2] NASCAR described his 1974 season as an indication of his \"consistent greatness\", finishing third in the season points having competed in only 19 of 30 races.[3] Pearson's career paralleled Richard Petty's, the driver who has won the most races in NASCAR history.[4] They accounted for 63 first/second-place finishes, with the edge going to Pearson. Petty had 200 wins in 1,184 starts, while Pearson had 105 wins in 574 starts. Pearson was nicknamed the \"Fox\" (and later the \"Silver Fox\") for his calculated approach to racing.[5]","image":"DavidPearson2008.jpg.webp"}
