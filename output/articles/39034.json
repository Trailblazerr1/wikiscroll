{"title":"Saint Helena pound","summary":"The Saint Helena pound is the currency of the Atlantic islands of Saint Helena and Ascension, which are constituent parts of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It is fixed at parity with the British pound sterling, and so both currencies are commonly accepted and circulated within Saint Helena. It is subdivided into 100 pence.","image":"Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png.webp","url":"Saint_Helena_pound"}
