{"title":"Post-traumatic stress disorder","summary":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[lower-alpha 1] is a mental and behavioral disorder[6] that can develop because of exposure to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, child abuse, domestic violence or other threats on a person's life.[1][7] Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in the way a person thinks and feels, and an increase in the fight-or-flight response.[1][3] These symptoms last for more than a month after the event.[1] Young children are less likely to show distress, but instead may express their memories through play.[1] A person with PTSD is at a higher risk of suicide and intentional self-harm.[2][8]","image":"A_mask%2C_painted_by_a_Marine_who_attends_art_therapy_to_relieve_post-traumatic_stress_disorder_symptoms%2C_USMC-120503-M-9426J-001.jpg.webp"}
