{"title":"Therapsid","summary":"Therapsida[lower-alpha 1] is a major group of eupelycosaurian synapsids that includes mammals and their ancestors.[1][2] Many of the traits today seen as unique to mammals had their origin within early therapsids, including limbs that were oriented more underneath the body, as opposed to the sprawling posture of many reptiles and salamanders. The earliest fossil attributed to Therapsida used to be Tetraceratops insignis from the Lower Permian.[3][4] However, in 2020 a study concluded that Tetraceratops is not a true therapsid, but should be considered a member of the more ancient Sphenacodontia, from which the therapsids evolved.[5]","image":"Therapsida_3.jpg.webp","url":"Therapsid"}
