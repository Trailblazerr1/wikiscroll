{"title":"Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)","summary":"The Trump International Hotel and Tower is a skyscraper condo-hotel in downtown Chicago, Illinois. The building, named for Donald Trump, was designed by architect Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Bovis Lend Lease built the 98-story structure, which reaches a height of 1,388 feet (423.2 m) including its spire, its roof topping out at 1,171 feet (357 m).  It is next to the main branch of the Chicago River, with a view of the entry to Lake Michigan beyond a series of bridges over the river.  The building received publicity when the winner of the first season of The Apprentice reality television show, Bill Rancic, chose to manage the construction of the tower over managing a Rancho Palos Verdes based \"Trump National Golf Course & Resort\" in the Los Angeles metro area.","image":"Chicago_September_2016-2.jpg.webp","url":"Trump_International_Hotel_and_Tower_(Chicago)"}
