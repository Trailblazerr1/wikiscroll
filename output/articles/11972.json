{"title":"Dalton's law","summary":"Dalton's law (also called Dalton's law of partial pressures) states that in a mixture of non-reacting gases, the total  pressure exerted is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases.[1] This empirical law was observed by John Dalton in 1801 and published in 1802.[2] Dalton's law is related to the ideal gas laws.","image":"Dalton's_law_of_partial_pressures.svg.png.webp"}
