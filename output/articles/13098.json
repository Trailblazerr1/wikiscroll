{"title":"Director-General of the World Trade Organization","summary":"The director-general of the World Trade Organization is the officer of the World Trade Organization (WTO) responsible for supervising and directing the organization's administrative operations. Since the World Trade Organization's decisions are made by member states, through either a Ministerial Conference or through the General Council, the director-general has little power over matters of policy â€“ the role is primarily advisory and managerial in nature. The director-general supervises the WTO secretariat of about 700 staff and is appointed by WTO members for a term of four years.[1]","image":"Okonjo-Iweala%2C_Ngozi_(2008_portrait).jpg.webp","url":"Director-General_of_the_World_Trade_Organization"}
