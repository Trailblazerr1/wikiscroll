{"title":"Auricularia auricula-judae","summary":"Auricularia auricula-judae, known most commonly as wood ear or black wood ear (alternatively, black fungus, jelly ear, tree ear, or by a number of other common names), is a species of edible Auriculariales fungus found worldwide. The fruiting body is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like shape and brown colouration; it grows upon wood, especially elder. Its specific epithet is derived from the belief that Judas Iscariot hanged himself from an elder tree; the common name \"Judas's ear\" was largely eclipsed by the corruption \"Jew's ear\". Today, \"wood ear\", \"jelly ear\", \"tree ear\", and other names are sometimes used. The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide, where it grows upon both dead and living wood.","image":"Auricularia_auricula-judae_64485.JPG.webp"}
