{"title":"Value-added tax","summary":"A value-added tax (VAT), known in some countries as a goods and services tax (GST), is a type of tax that is assessed incrementally. It is levied on the price of a product or service at each stage of production, distribution, or sale to the end consumer. If the ultimate consumer is a business that collects and pays to the government VAT on its products or services, it can reclaim the tax paid. It is similar to, and is often compared with, a sales tax. VAT is an indirect tax because the person who ultimately pays the tax isn't necessarily the same person as the one who pays the tax to the tax authorities.","image":"Countries_with_VAT.svg.png.webp","url":"Value-added_tax"}
