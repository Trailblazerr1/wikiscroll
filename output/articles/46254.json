{"title":"Two-dimensional space","summary":"Two-dimensional space (also known as 2D space, 2-space, or bi-dimensional space) is a geometric setting in which two values (called parameters) are required to determine the position of an element (i.e., point). The set R 2 {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}} of pairs of real numbers with appropriate structure often serves as the canonical example of a two-dimensional Euclidean space. For a generalization of the concept, see dimension.","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg","url":"Two-dimensional_space"}
