{"title":"Two-dimensional space","summary":"Two-dimensional space (also known as 2D space, 2-space, or bi-dimensional space) is a geometric setting in which two values (called parameters) are required to determine the position of an element (i.e., point). The set \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{2}}\n  \n of pairs of real numbers with appropriate structure often serves as the canonical example of a two-dimensional Euclidean space. For a generalization of the concept, see dimension.","image":"e150115ab9f63023215109595b76686a1ff890fd.svg"}
