{"title":"Siren (mythology)","summary":"In Greek mythology, the sirens (Ancient Greek: singular: Σειρήν, Seirḗn; plural: Σειρῆνες, Seirênes) were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. It is also said that they can even charm the winds.[1] Roman poets placed them on some small islands called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the \"flowery\" island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa,[2] is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.[3] All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.","image":"NAMA_Sirène.jpg.webp","url":"Siren_(mythology)"}
