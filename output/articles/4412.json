{"title":"Armenian genocide recognition","summary":"Armenian genocide recognition is the formal acceptance that the systematic massacres and forced deportation of Armenians committed by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, during and after the First World War, constituted genocide. Most historians outside of Turkey recognize that the Ottoman persecution of Armenians was a genocide.[1][2][3] However, despite the recognition of the genocidal character of the massacre of Armenians in scholarship as well as in civil society, some governments have been reticent to officially acknowledge the killings as genocide because of political concerns about their relations with the Republic of Turkey.[4] As of 2021, governments and parliaments of 33 countries—including the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Russia and Brazil—have formally recognized the Armenian genocide.","image":"The_Eternal_Flame_-_Armenian_Genocide_Memorial_in_Yerevan.jpg.webp","url":"Armenian_genocide_recognition"}
