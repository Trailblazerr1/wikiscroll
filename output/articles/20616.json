{"title":"Hobart","summary":"Hobart (/ˈhoʊbɑːrt/ (listen)[5]) is the capital and most populous city of the Australian island state of Tasmania. Home to almost half of all Tasmanians, it is the least-populated Australian state capital city, and second-smallest if territories are taken into account, after Darwin, Northern Territory.[1] Hobart is located in Tasmania's south-east on the estuary of the River Derwent, making it the most southern of Australia's capital cities. Its skyline is dominated by the 1,271-metre (4,170 ft) kunanyi/Mount Wellington,[6] and its harbour forms the second-deepest natural port in the world,[7] with much of the city's waterfront consisting of reclaimed land.[8] The metropolitan area is often referred to as Greater Hobart, to differentiate it from the City of Hobart, one of the five local government areas that cover the city.[9] It has a mild maritime climate.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
