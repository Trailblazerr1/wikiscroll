{"title":"Joel (prophet)","summary":"Joel (/ˈdʒoʊəl/; Hebrew: יוֹאֵל‎ – Yō'ēl; Greek: Ἰωήλ – Iōḗl; Syriac: ܝܘܐܝܠ‎ – Yu'il) was a prophet of ancient Israel, the second of the twelve minor prophets and according to the book itself the author of the Book of Joel. He is mentioned by name only once in the Hebrew Bible, in the introduction to that book, as the son of Pethuel (Joel 1:1). The name Joel combines the covenant name of God, YHWH (or Yahweh), and El (god), and has been translated as \"one to whom YHWH is God,\" that is, a worshiper of YHWH.[1]","image":"Joel_(Michelangelo).jpg.webp"}
