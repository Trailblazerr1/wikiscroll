{"title":"Photodiode","summary":"A photodiode is a semiconductor pâ€“n junction device that converts light into an electrical current.[1]  The current is generated when photons are absorbed in the photodiode.  Photodiodes may contain optical filters, built-in lenses, and may have large or small surface areas. Photodiodes usually have a slower response time as their surface area increases. The common, traditional solar cell used to generate electric solar power is a large area photodiode.","image":"Fotodio.jpg.webp"}
