{"title":"Fiction","summary":"Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying people, events, or places in imaginary ways that are not strictly based on history or fact.[1][2][3] In its most narrow usage, fiction applies to written narratives in prose and often specifically novels,[4][5] as well as novellas and short stories. More broadly, however, fiction has come to encompass imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games.","image":"Alice_par_John_Tenniel_30.png.webp"}
