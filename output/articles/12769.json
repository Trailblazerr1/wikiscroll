{"title":"Developed country","summary":"A developed country (or industrialized country, high-income country, more economically developed country (MEDC), advanced country[3][4]) is a sovereign state that has a high quality of life, developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are gross domestic product (GDP), gross national product (GNP), the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.[5] Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate. A point of reference of US$20,000 in 2021 USD nominal GDP per capita for the IMF is a good point of departure, it is a similar level of development to the United States in 1960.[6]","image":"Imf-advanced-un-least-developed-2008.svg.png.webp","url":"Developed_country"}
