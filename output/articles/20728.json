{"title":"Homotopy","summary":"In topology, a branch of mathematics, two continuous functions from one topological space to another are called homotopic (from Ancient Greek: ὁμός homós \"same, similar\" and τόπος tópos \"place\") if one can be \"continuously deformed\" into the other, such a deformation being called a homotopy between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of homotopy groups and cohomotopy groups, important invariants in algebraic topology.[1]","image":"HomotopySmall.gif"}
