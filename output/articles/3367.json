{"title":"Amniocentesis","summary":"Amniocentesis (also referred to as an amniotic fluid test or, informally, an \"amnio\") is a medical procedure[note 1] used primarily in prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and fetal infections[1] as well as for sex determination. In this procedure, a small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus. The fetal DNA is then examined for genetic abnormalities.","image":"Amniocentesis.png.webp"}
