{"title":"Abortion in Canada","summary":"Abortion in Canada is technically legal at all stages of pregnancy (regardless of the reason) and is publicly funded as a medical procedure under the combined effects of the federal Canada Health Act and provincial health-care systems.[1] However, access to services and resources varies by region.[2] While some non-legal barriers to access continue to exist,[1] Canada is the only nation with absolutely no legal restrictions at the federal level to access abortion services.[3][4] Nevertheless few providers in Canada offer abortion care beyond 23 weeks and 6 days without a medical reason due to professional medical guidelines.[5]","image":"Red_leaf_with_white_cross3.svg-removebg-preview_(1).png.webp","url":"Abortion_in_Canada"}
