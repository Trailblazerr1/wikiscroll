{"title":"Short QT syndrome","summary":"Short QT syndrome (SQT) is a very rare genetic disease of the electrical system of the heart, and is associated with an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death.[1] The syndrome gets its name from a characteristic feature seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG) – a shortening of the QT interval.  It is caused by mutations in genes encoding ion channels that shorten the cardiac action potential, and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.[1] The condition is diagnosed using a 12-lead ECG.[2]  Short QT syndrome can be treated using an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or medications including quinidine.[3]  Short QT syndrome was first described in 2000,[4] and the first genetic mutation associated with the condition was identified in 2004.[5]","image":"SinusRhythmLabels.svg.png.webp"}
