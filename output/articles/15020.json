{"title":"Equinox","summary":"An equinox is traditionally defined as the time when the plane of Earth's equator passes through the geometric center of the Sun's disk.[3][4] This occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September. In other words, it is the moment at which the center of the visible Sun is directly above the equator.","image":"Earth-lighting-equinox_EN.png.webp"}
