{"title":"VX (nerve agent)","summary":"VX is an extremely toxic synthetic chemical compound in the organophosphorus class, specifically, a thiophosphonate. In the class of nerve agents, it was developed for military use in chemical warfare after translation of earlier discoveries of organophosphate toxicity in pesticide research. In recent years, VX was found to be the agent used in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam. In its pure form, VX is an oily, relatively non-volatile, liquid that is amber-like in color.[4] Because of its low volatility, VX persists in environments where it is dispersed.[5]","image":"VX-S-enantiomer-2D-skeletal.png.webp"}
