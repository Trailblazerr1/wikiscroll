{"title":"Anal sex","summary":"Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure.[1][2][3] Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging.[4][5] Although anal sex most commonly means penile–anal penetration,[3][4][6] sources sometimes use anal intercourse to exclusively denote penile–anal penetration, and anal sex to denote any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.[6][7]","image":"Wiki-analsex.png.webp","url":"Anal_sex"}
