{"title":"Emphysema","summary":"Emphysema, or pulmonary emphysema, is a lower respiratory tract disease,[5] characterised by air-filled spaces (pneumatoses) in the lung, that can vary in size and may be very large. The spaces are caused by the breakdown of the walls of the alveoli and they replace the spongy lung parenchyma. This reduces the total alveolar surface available for gas exchange leading to a reduction in oxygen supply for the blood.[6] Emphysema usually affects the middle aged or older population because it takes time to develop with the effects of smoking, and other risk factors. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic risk factor that may lead to the condition presenting earlier.[7]","image":"Emphysema%2C_centrilobular_(4563270814).jpg.webp","url":"Emphysema"}
