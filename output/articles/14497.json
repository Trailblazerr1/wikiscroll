{"title":"Electroreception","summary":"Electroreception or electroception is the biological ability to perceive natural electrical stimuli.[1] It has been observed almost exclusively in aquatic or amphibious animals since water is a much better conductor of electricity than air. The known exceptions are the monotremes\n(echidnas and platypuses), cockroaches, and bees. Electroreception is used in electrolocation (detecting objects) and for electrocommunication.","image":"Electroreceptors_in_a_sharks_head.svg.png.webp"}
