{"title":"Porosity","summary":"Porosity or void fraction is a measure of the void (i.e. \"empty\") spaces in a material, and is a fraction of the volume of voids over the total volume, between 0 and 1, or as a percentage between 0% and 100%. Strictly speaking, some tests measure the \"accessible void\", the total amount of void space accessible from the surface (cf. closed-cell foam).","image":"43be9f48ff5af36c9b4c0eb2e1757a0b7424f811.svg"}
