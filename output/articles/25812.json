{"title":"Legal tender","summary":"Legal tender is a form of money that courts of law are required to recognize as satisfactory payment for any monetary debt.[1] Each jurisdiction determines what is legal tender, but essentially it is anything which when offered (\"tendered\") in payment of a debt extinguishes the debt. There is no obligation on the creditor to accept the tendered payment, but the act of tendering the payment in legal tender discharges the debt.","image":"RBI_5-rupee_note%2C_overprinted_Government_of_Pakistan%2C_1947.jpg.webp"}
