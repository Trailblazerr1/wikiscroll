{"title":"Matsuo Bashō","summary":"Matsuo Bashō, (松尾 芭蕉, 1644 – November 28, 1694[2]) born Matsuo Kinsaku, (松尾 金作) then Matsuo Chūemon Munefusa, (松尾 忠右衛門 宗房)[3] was the most famous poet of the Edo period in Japan. During his lifetime, Bashō was recognized for his works in the collaborative haikai no renga form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with “Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton” (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara.[4] Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, \"Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.\"[5]","image":"Basho_by_Hokusai-small.jpg.webp","url":"Matsuo_Bashō"}
