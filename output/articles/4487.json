{"title":"Artesian aquifer","summary":"An artesian aquifer is a confined aquifer containing groundwater under positive pressure.[1] An artesian aquifer has trapped water, surrounded by layers of impermeable rock or clay which apply positive pressure to the water contained within the aquifer.[1] If a well were to be sunk into an artesian aquifer, water in the well-pipe would rise to a height corresponding to the point where hydrostatic equilibrium is reached.[1]","image":"Artesian_aquifer_scheme.svg.png.webp","url":"Artesian_aquifer"}
