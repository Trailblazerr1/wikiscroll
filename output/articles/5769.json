{"title":"Batted ball","summary":"In the sports of baseball and softball, a batted ball is a pitch that has been contacted by the batter's bat.  Depending on where the ball lands, a batted ball can become either a fair ball or a foul ball.  If a batted ball is a fair ball, fielders attempt to get the batter out.  A foul ball is assessed as a strike unless the batter has already accumulated two strikes, in which case the number of strikes does not increase (with the exception of a foul bunt or foul tip).  Batted balls are also classified by their trajectory.  The most common of these trajectory-based classifications are fly balls, line drives, and ground balls.","image":"Casey_McGehee_2009.jpg.webp","url":"Batted_ball"}
