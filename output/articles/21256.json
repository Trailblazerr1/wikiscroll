{"title":"Hydrophobe","summary":"In chemistry, hydrophobicity is the physical property of a molecule that is seemingly repelled from a mass of water (known as a hydrophobe).[1] (There is no repulsive force involved; it is an absence of attraction.) In contrast, hydrophiles are attracted to water.","image":"150_deg_water_contact_angle.png.webp","url":"Hydrophobe"}
