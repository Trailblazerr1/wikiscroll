{"title":"Freedom of Information Act (United States)","summary":"The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, is a federal freedom of information law that requires the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the United States government upon request. The act defines agency records subject to disclosure, outlines mandatory disclosure procedures, and defines nine exemptions to the statute.[1][2] The act was intended to make U.S. government agencies' functions more transparent so that the American public could more easily identify problems in government functioning and put pressure on Congress, agency officials, and the president to address them.[3]","image":"Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg.png.webp","url":"Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)"}
