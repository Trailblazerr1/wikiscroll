{"title":"Protectorate","summary":"A protectorate is a state that is controlled and protected by another sovereign state. It is a dependent territory that has been granted local autonomy over most internal affairs while still recognizing the suzerainty of a more powerful sovereign state without being its direct possession.[1][2][3] In exchange, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations depending on the terms of their arrangement.[3] Usually protectorates are established de jure by a treaty.[1][2] Under certain conditions as of Egypt under British rule (1882â€“1914) e.g., a state can also be labelled  as a de facto protectorate or a \"veiled protectorate\".[4][5][6]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp","url":"Protectorate"}
