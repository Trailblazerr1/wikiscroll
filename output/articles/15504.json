{"title":"Existential crisis","summary":"Existential crisis, also known as existential dread, are moments when individuals question whether their lives have meaning, purpose, or value, and are negatively impacted by the contemplation.[1] It may be commonly, but not necessarily, tied to depression or inevitably negative speculations on purpose in life such as the futility of all effort (e.g., \"if one day I will be forgotten, what is the point of all of my work?\"). This issue of the meaning and purpose of human existence is a major focus of the philosophical tradition of existentialism.","image":"Existential_crisis.jpg.webp"}
