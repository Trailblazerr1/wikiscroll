{"title":"Aegean civilization","summary":"Aegean civilization is a general term for the Bronze Age civilizations of Greece around the Aegean Sea. There are three distinct but communicating and interacting geographic regions covered by this term: Crete, the Cyclades and the Greek mainland.[1] Crete is associated with the Minoan civilization from the Early Bronze Age. The Cycladic civilization converges with the mainland during the Early Helladic (\"Minyan\") period and with Crete in the Middle Minoan period. From c. 1450 BC (Late Helladic, Late Minoan), the Greek Mycenaean civilization spreads to Crete, probably by military conquest.","image":"Map_of_Greece%2C_Archipelago_and_part_of_Anadoli%3B_Louis_Stanislas_d'Arcy_Delarochette_1791.jpg.webp"}
