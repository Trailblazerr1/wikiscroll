{"title":"Women's health","summary":"Women's health refers to the health of women, which differs from that of men in many unique ways. Women's health is an example of population health, where health is defined by the World Health Organization as \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". Often treated as simply women's reproductive health, many groups argue for a broader definition pertaining to the overall health of women, better expressed as \"The health of women\". These differences are further exacerbated in developing countries where women, whose health includes both their risks and experiences, are further disadvantaged.","image":"Women's_health_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Women's_health"}
