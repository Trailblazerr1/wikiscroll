{"title":"Prime Minister of Canada","summary":"The prime minister of Canada (French: premier ministre du Canada)[note 1] is the first minister of the Crown. The prime minister acts as the head of government for Canada, chairs and selects the membership of the Cabinet, and advises the Crown on the exercise of executive power and much of the royal prerogative. As prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons, they typically sit as a member of Parliament (MP) and lead the largest party or a coalition in the House of Commons.","image":"Government_of_Canada_signature.svg.png.webp"}
