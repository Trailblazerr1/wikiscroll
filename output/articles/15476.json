{"title":"Excise","summary":"An excise, or excise tax, is any duty on manufactured goods that is levied at the moment of manufacture rather than at sale. Excises are often associated with customs duties (which are levied on pre-existing goods when they cross a designated border in a specific direction); customs are levied on goods that become taxable items at the border, while excise is levied on goods that came into existence inland.","image":"Lincoln_Beer_Stamp_1871.JPG.webp"}
