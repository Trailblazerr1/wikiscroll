{"title":"Semitic languages","summary":"The Semitic languages are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family.[1] They are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of West Asia, the Horn of Africa, and latterly also North Africa, Malta and in small pockets in the Caucasus[2] as well as in often large immigrant and expatriate communities in North America, Europe, and Australasia.[3][4] The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the GÃ¶ttingen School of History,[5] who derived the name from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis.","image":"Semitic_languages.svg.png.webp"}
