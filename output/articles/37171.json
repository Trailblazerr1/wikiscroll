{"title":"Ras GTPase","summary":"Ras, from \"Rat sarcoma virus\", is a family of related proteins that are expressed in all animal cell lineages and organs. All Ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called small GTPase, and are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). Ras is the prototypical member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in three-dimensional structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.","image":"Hras_surface_colored_by_conservation.png.webp"}
