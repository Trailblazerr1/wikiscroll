{"title":"Myxobolus cerebralis","summary":"Myxobolus cerebralis is a myxosporean parasite of salmonids (salmon, trout, and their allies) that causes whirling disease in farmed salmon and trout and also in wild fish populations. It was first described in rainbow trout in Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe (including Russia), the United States, South Africa,[1] Canada[2] and other countries.  In the 1980s, M. cerebralis was found to require a tubificid oligochaete (a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life cycle.[3]  The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with polar filaments ejected from nematocyst-like capsules.","image":"Fdl17-9-grey.jpg.webp","url":"Myxobolus_cerebralis"}
