{"title":"Convolutional neural network","summary":"In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.[1] They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps.[2][3] Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are only equivariant, as opposed to invariant, to translation.[4] They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems,[5] image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing,[6] brain-computer interfaces,[7] and financial time series.[8]","image":"Kernel_Machine.svg.png.webp"}
