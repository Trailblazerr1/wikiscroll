{"title":"Carnotaurus","summary":"Carnotaurus /ˌkɑːrnoʊˈtɔːrəs/ is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in South America during the Late Cretaceous period, probably sometime between 72 and 69.9 million years ago. The only species is Carnotaurus sastrei. Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation. Carnotaurus is a derived member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern landmasses of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous. Within the Abelisauridae, the genus is often considered a member of the Brachyrostra, a clade of short-snouted forms restricted to South America.","image":"Carnotaurus%2C_Chlupáč_Museum%2C_Prague-2.jpg.webp","url":"Carnotaurus"}
