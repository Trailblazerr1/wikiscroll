{"title":"Series and parallel circuits","summary":"Two-terminal components and electrical networks can be connected in series or parallel. The resulting electrical network will have two terminals, and itself can participate in a series or parallel topology. Whether a two-terminal \"object\" is an electrical component (e.g. a resistor) or an electrical network (e.g. resistors in series) is a matter of perspective. This article will use \"component\" to refer to a two-terminal \"object\" that participate in the series/parallel networks.","image":"Series_circuit.svg.png.webp","url":"Series_and_parallel_circuits"}
