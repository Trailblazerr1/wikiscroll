{"title":"The Room","summary":"The Room is a 2003 American independent drama film written, produced, executive produced and directed by Tommy Wiseau in his feature-length directorial debut, who stars in the film alongside Juliette Danielle and Greg Sestero. The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny (Wiseau), his deceptive fianc√©e Lisa (Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark (Sestero). A significant portion of the film is dedicated to a series of unrelated subplots, most of which involve at least one supporting character and are left unresolved due to the film's inconsistent narrative structure. The work was reportedly intended to be semi-autobiographical in nature; according to Wiseau, the title alludes to the potential of a room to be the site of both good and bad events.[4] The stage play from which the film is derived was so-called due to its events taking place entirely in a single room.[5]","image":"TheRoomMovie.jpg.webp"}
