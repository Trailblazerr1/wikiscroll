{"title":"Eagle (British comics)","summary":"Eagle was a British children's comics periodical, first published from 1950 to 1969, and then in a relaunched format from 1982 to 1994.  It was founded by Marcus Morris, an Anglican vicar from Lancashire.  Morris edited a Southport parish magazine called The Anvil, but felt that the church was not communicating its message effectively.  Simultaneously disillusioned with contemporary children's literature, he and Anvil artist Frank Hampson created a dummy comic based on Christian values.  Morris proposed the idea to several Fleet Street publishers, with little success, until Hulton Press took it on.","image":"Eagle_1950_issue_1_front_page.jpg.webp"}
