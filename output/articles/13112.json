{"title":"Disaster risk reduction","summary":"Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing the risks of disaster. It aims to reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them. Here it has been strongly influenced by the mass of research on vulnerability that has appeared in print since the mid-1970s[1] as well as the mapping of natural disaster risks.[2] Disaster risk reduction is the responsibility of development and relief agencies alike. It should be an integral part of the way such organizations do their work, not an add-on or one-off action. Disaster risk reduction is very wide-ranging: Its scope is much broader and deeper than conventional emergency management. There is potential for Disaster risk reduction initiatives in just about every sector of development and humanitarian work. Disaster risk is an indicator of poor development, so reducing disaster risk requires integrating DRR and DRM practice into the sustainable development goals. We need to manage risks, not just disasters.[3]","image":"Disaster_Risk_Reduction_(10692926193).jpg.webp"}
