{"title":"Banded iron formation","summary":"Banded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock consisting of alternating layers of iron oxides and iron-poor chert. They can be up to several hundred meters in thickness and extend laterally for several hundred kilometers. Almost all of these formations are of Precambrian age and are thought to record the oxygenation of the Earth's oceans. Some of the Earth's oldest rock formations, which formed about 3,700Â million years ago (Ma), are associated with banded iron formations.","image":"Banded_iron_formation_Dales_Gorge.jpg.webp"}
