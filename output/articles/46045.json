{"title":"Troponin C type 1","summary":"Troponin C, also known as TN-C or  TnC, is a protein that resides in the troponin complex on actin thin filaments of striated muscle (cardiac, fast-twitch skeletal, or slow-twitch skeletal) and is responsible for binding calcium to activate muscle contraction.[5][6] Troponin C is encoded by the TNNC1 gene in humans[7] for both cardiac and slow skeletal muscle.","image":"Protein_TNNC1_PDB_1aj4.png.webp","url":"Troponin_C_type_1"}
