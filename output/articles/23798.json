{"title":"John Stuart Mill","summary":"John Stuart Mill (20 May 1806 â€“ 7 May 1873),[10] also cited as J. S. Mill, was an English philosopher, political economist, Member of Parliament (MP) and civil servant. One of the most influential thinkers in the history of classical liberalism, he contributed widely to social theory, political theory, and political economy. Dubbed \"the most influential English-speaking philosopher of the nineteenth century\",[11] he conceived of liberty as justifying the freedom of the individual in opposition to unlimited state and social control.[12] In his later years, whilst continuing to staunchly defend individual rights and freedoms, he became more critical of economic liberalism and his views on political economy moved towards a form of liberal socialism.[13]","image":"John_Stuart_Mill_by_London_Stereoscopic_Company%2C_c1870.jpg.webp","url":"John_Stuart_Mill"}
