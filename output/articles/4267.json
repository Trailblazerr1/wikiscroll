{"title":"Archaeplastida","summary":"The Archaeplastida (or kingdom Plantae sensu lato \"in a broad sense\") are a major group of eukaryotes, comprising the photoautotrophic red algae (Rhodophyta), green algae, land plants, and the minor group glaucophytes.[5] It also includes the non-photosynthetic lineage Rhodelphidia, a predatorial (eukaryotrophic) flagellate that is sister to the Rhodophyta, and probably the microscopic picozoans.[6] The Archaeplastida have chloroplasts that are surrounded by two membranes, suggesting that they were acquired directly through a single endosymbiosis event by feeding on a cyanobacterium.[7] All other groups which have chloroplasts, besides the amoeboid genus Paulinella, have chloroplasts surrounded by three or four membranes, suggesting they were acquired secondarily from red or green algae.[note 1] Unlike red and green algae, glaucophytes have never been involved in secondary endosymbiosis events.[9]","image":"Sprague_River_(Klamath_County%2C_Oregon_scenic_images)_(klaDA0073).jpg.webp","url":"Archaeplastida"}
