{"title":"Track ballast","summary":"Track ballast forms the trackbed upon which railroad ties (sleepers) are laid. It is packed between, below, and around the ties.[1]  It is used to bear the load from the railroad ties, to facilitate drainage of water, and also to keep down vegetation that might interfere with the track structure.[1] Ballast also holds the track in place as the trains roll over it. A variety of materials have been used as track ballast, including crushed stone, washed gravel, bank run (unwashed) gravel, torpedo gravel (a mixture of coarse sand and small gravel), slag, chats, coal cinders, sand,[2] and burnt clay.[3] The term \"ballast\" comes from a nautical term for the stones used to stabilize a ship.[1]","image":"Rails.and.ballast.bb.jpg.webp"}
