{"title":"Zaireeka","summary":"Zaireeka is the eighth studio album by American rock band The Flaming Lips, released on October 28, 1997 by Warner Bros. Records. The album consists of 4 CDs designed so that when played simultaneously on 4 separate audio systems, they would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound; the discs could also be played in different combinations, omitting 1, 2 or 3 discs. Each of its 8 songs consists of 4 stereo tracks, one from each CD. The album's title is a portmanteau of two words: Zaire, chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and Eureka (literally: \"I have found it\"), an expression of joyous discovery.[1]","image":"Zaireeka_cover.png.webp"}
