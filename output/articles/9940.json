{"title":"Chromium","summary":"Chromium is a chemical element with the symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is the first element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard, and brittle transition metal.[4] Chromium is the main additive in stainless steel, to which it adds anti-corrosive properties. Chromium is also highly valued as a metal that is able to be highly polished while resisting tarnishing. Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the visible spectrum, and almost 90% of infrared light.[5] The name of the element is derived from the Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color,[6] because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.","image":"Chromium_crystals_and_1cm3_cube.jpg.webp","url":"Chromium"}
