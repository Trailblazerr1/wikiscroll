{"title":"Modular form","summary":"In mathematics, a modular form is a (complex) analytic function on the upper half-plane satisfying a certain kind of functional equation with respect to the group action of the modular group, and also satisfying a growth condition. The theory of modular forms therefore belongs to complex analysis but the main importance of the theory has traditionally been in its connections with number theory. Modular forms appear in other areas, such as algebraic topology, sphere packing, and string theory.","image":"f02b3ba5875d6cfaf47af320385b5df1cd39bab2.svg","url":"Modular_form"}
