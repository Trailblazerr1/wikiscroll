{"title":"Intertropical Convergence Zone","summary":"The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ, pronounced \"itch\"[1]), known by sailors as the doldrums[2] or the calms because of its monotonous windless weather, is the area where the northeast and the southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic Equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonial circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough, a usage that is more common in Australia and parts of Asia.","image":"IntertropicalConvergenceZone-EO.jpg.webp","url":"Intertropical_Convergence_Zone"}
