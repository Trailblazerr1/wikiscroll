{"title":"Synapsid","summary":"Synapsids[lower-alpha 1] are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to the other members of the amniote clade, such as reptiles and birds.[5] Unlike other amniotes, they have a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name.[6] Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids. This informal term consists of all synapsids that are not therapsids, a monophyletic, more advanced, mammal-like group. The non-mammalian synapsids were described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics, but this misleading terminology is no longer in use[7][8] as synapsids as a whole are no longer considered reptiles.[9] They are now more correctly referred to as stem mammals or proto-mammals.[10]","image":"Synapsid_diversity_2.jpg.webp","url":"Synapsid"}
