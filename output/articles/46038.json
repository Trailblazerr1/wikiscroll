{"title":"Tropical cyclone rainfall climatology","summary":"A tropical cyclone rainfall climatology is developed to determine rainfall characteristics of past tropical cyclones.  A tropical cyclone rainfall climatology can be used to help forecast current or upcoming tropical cyclone impacts.  The degree of a tropical cyclone rainfall impact depends upon speed of movement, storm size, and degree of vertical wind shear.  One of the most significant threats from tropical cyclones is heavy rainfall.  Large, slow moving, and non-sheared tropical cyclones produce the heaviest rains.  The intensity of a tropical cyclone appears to have little bearing on its potential for rainfall over land, but satellite measurements over the last several years show that more intense tropical cyclones produce noticeably more rainfall over water.  Flooding from tropical cyclones remains a significant cause of fatalities, particularly in low-lying areas.","image":"Cyclone_Catarina_from_the_ISS_on_March_26_2004.JPG.webp"}
