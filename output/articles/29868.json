{"title":"Migration Period","summary":"The Migration Period, also known as the Barbarian Invasions (from the Roman and Greek perspective), is a term sometimes used for the period in the history of Europe that saw the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire.  The term refers to the important role played by invasions of non-Roman peoples, notably the Franks, Goths, Allemanni, Alans, Huns, early Slavs and the Pannonian Avars within or into the Roman Empire. The period is traditionally taken to have begun in ADÂ 375 (possibly as early as 300) and ended in 568.[2] Various factors contributed to this phenomenon of migration and invasion, and their role and significance are still widely discussed.","image":"Invasions_of_the_Roman_Empire_1.png.webp","url":"Migration_Period"}
