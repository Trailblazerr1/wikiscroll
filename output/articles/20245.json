{"title":"Hexokinase","summary":"A hexokinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates hexoses (six-carbon sugars), forming hexose phosphate. In most organisms, glucose is the most important substrate for hexokinases, and glucose-6-phosphate is the most important product. Hexokinase possesses the ability to transfer an inorganic phosphate group from ATP to a substrate.","image":"Hexokinase_3O08_structure.png.webp","url":"Hexokinase"}
