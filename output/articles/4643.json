{"title":"Aspartic acid","summary":"Aspartic acid (symbol Asp or D;[4] the ionic form is known as aspartate), is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.[5] Like all other amino acids, it contains an amino group and a carboxylic acid. Its α-amino group is in the protonated –NH+3 form under physiological conditions, while its α-carboxylic acid group is deprotonated −COO− under physiological conditions. Aspartic acid has an acidic side chain (CH2COOH) which reacts with other amino acids, enzymes and proteins in the body.[5] Under physiological conditions (pH 7.4) in proteins the side chain usually occurs as the negatively charged aspartate form, −COO−.[5] It is a non-essential amino acid in humans, meaning the body can synthesize it as needed. It is encoded by the codons GAT and GAC. In mRNA, CUA and CUG.","image":"L-Asparaginsäure_-_L-Aspartic_acid.svg.png.webp"}
