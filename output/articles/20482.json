{"title":"History of Serbia","summary":"The history of Serbia covers the historical development of Serbia and of its predecessor states, from the Early Stone Age to the present state, as well as that of the Serbian people and of the areas they ruled historically. The scope of Serbian habitation and rule has varied much through the ages, and, as a result, the history of Serbia is similarly elastic in what it includes.","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_Serbia_small.svg.png.webp"}
