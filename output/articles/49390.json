{"title":"Zaire ebolavirus","summary":"Zaire ebolavirus, more commonly known as Ebola virus (/iˈboʊlə, ɪ-/; EBOV), is one of six known species within the genus Ebolavirus.[1] Four of the six known ebolaviruses, including EBOV, cause a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and other mammals, known as Ebola virus disease (EVD). Ebola virus has caused the majority of human deaths from EVD, and was the cause of the 2013–2016 epidemic in western Africa,[2] which resulted in at least 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 confirmed deaths.[3][4]","image":"lossy-page1-220px-Ebola_Virus_-_Electron_Micrograph.tiff.jpg.webp"}
