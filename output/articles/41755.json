{"title":"Spinor","summary":"In geometry and physics, spinors /spɪnər/ are elements of a complex vector space that can be associated with Euclidean space.[lower-alpha 2] Like geometric vectors and more general tensors, spinors transform linearly when the Euclidean space is subjected to a  slight (infinitesimal) rotation.[lower-alpha 3] However, when a sequence of such small rotations is composed (integrated) to form an overall final rotation, the resulting spinor transformation depends on which sequence of small rotations was used. Unlike vectors and tensors,  a spinor transforms to its negative when the space is continuously rotated through a complete turn from 0° to 360° (see picture). This property characterizes spinors: spinors can be viewed as the \"square roots\" of vectors (although this is inaccurate and may be misleading; they are better viewed as \"square roots\" of sections of vector bundles – in the case of the exterior algebra bundle of the cotangent bundle, they thus become \"square roots\" of differential forms).","image":"Spinor_on_the_circle.png.webp"}
