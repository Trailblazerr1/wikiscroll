{"title":"Sea shanty","summary":"A sea shanty, chantey, or chanty is a genre of traditional folk song that was once commonly sung as a work song to accompany rhythmical labor aboard large merchant sailing vessels. They were found mostly on British and other European ships, and some had roots in lore and legend. The term shanty most accurately refers to a specific style of work song belonging to this historical repertoire. However, in recent, popular usage, the scope of its definition is sometimes expanded to admit a wider range of repertoire and characteristics, or to refer to a \"maritime work song\" in general.","image":"lossless-page1-220px-Halyard_illustration.tiff.png.webp","url":"Sea_shanty"}
