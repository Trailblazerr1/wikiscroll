{"title":"Power inverter","summary":"A power inverter, inverter or invertor is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).[1] The resulting AC frequency obtained depends on the particular device employed. Inverters do the opposite of \"converters\" which were originally large electromechanical devices converting AC to DC.[2]","image":"MÃ¼llberg_Speyer_-_2.JPG.webp"}
