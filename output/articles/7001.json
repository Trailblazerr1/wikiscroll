{"title":"Bluebuck","summary":"The bluebuck (Afrikaans: bloubok /ˈblaʊbɒk/) or blue antelope (Hippotragus leucophaeus) is an extinct species of antelope that lived in South Africa until around 1800. It is congeneric with the roan antelope and sable antelope (belonging in the genus Hippotragus), but was smaller than either. It was sometimes considered a subspecies of the roan antelope, but a genetic study has confirmed it as a distinct species.","image":"Hippotragus_leucophaeus%2C_Naturhistorisches_Museum_Wien.jpg.webp","url":"Bluebuck"}
