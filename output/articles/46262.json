{"title":"Two kingdoms doctrine","summary":"The two kingdoms doctrine is a Protestant Christian doctrine that teaches that God is the ruler of the whole world and that he rules in two ways. The doctrine is held by Lutherans and represents the view of some Calvinists. John Calvin significantly modified Martin Luther's original two kingdoms doctrine[1] and certain neo-Calvinists have adopted a different view known as transformationalism.","image":"Lutherrose.svg.png.webp"}
