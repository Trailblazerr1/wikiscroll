{"title":"Photosynthesis","summary":"Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek phōs (φῶς), \"light\", and sunthesis (σύνθεσις), \"putting together\".[1][2][3] In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product that stores three times more chemical energy than the carbohydrates.[4] Most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.[5]","image":"Seawifs_global_biosphere.jpg.webp","url":"Photosynthesis"}
