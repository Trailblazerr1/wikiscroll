{"title":"1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine","summary":"The 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, later came to be known as The Great Revolt (al-Thawra al- Kubra)[10] or The Great Palestinian Revolt (Thawrat Filastin al-Kubra),[11] was a nationalist uprising by Palestinian Arabs in Mandatory Palestine against the British administration of the Palestine Mandate, demanding Arab independence and the end of the policy of open-ended Jewish immigration  and land purchases with the stated goal of establishing a \"Jewish National Home\".[12] The uprising coincided with a peak in the influx of immigrant Jews, some 60,000, that year,-the Jewish population having grown under British auspices from 57,000 to 320,000 in 1935[13]  – and with the growing plight of the rural fellahin rendered landless, who as they moved to metropolitan centres to escape their abject poverty found themselves socially marginalized.[14][lower-alpha 1] Since 1920 Jews and Palestinians had been involved in a cycle of attacks and counter-attacks, and the immediate spark for the uprising was  the murder of two Jews by a Qassamite band, and the retaliatory killing by Jewish gunmen of two Arab labourers, incidents which triggered a flare-up of violence across Palestine.[16]  A month into the disturbances Hajj Amin al-Husseini declared 16 May 1936 as 'Palestine Day' and called for a General Strike. The revolt was branded by many in the Jewish Yishuv as \"immoral and terroristic\", often compared to fascism and Nazism.[17] Ben Gurion, however, described Arab causes as fear of growing Jewish economic power, opposition to mass Jewish immigration and fear of the English identification with Zionism.[17]","image":"Train_hostages.jpg.webp"}
