{"title":"Dervish","summary":"Dervish or Darvesh or Darwīsh (from Persian: درویش‎, Darvīsh[1]) in Islam can refer broadly to members of a Sufi fraternity (tariqah),[2][3] or more narrowly to a religious mendicant, who chose or accepted material poverty.[3][4] The latter usage is found particularly in Persian and Turkish (Derviş), corresponding to the Arabic term faqir.[3] Their focus is on the universal values of love and service, deserting the illusions of ego to reach God. In most Sufi orders, a dervish is known to practice dhikr through physical exertions or religious practices to attain the ecstatic trance to reach God.[5] Their most common practice is Sama, which is associated with the 13th-century mystic Rumi.","image":"Indischer_Maler_um_1650_(II)_001.jpg.webp"}
