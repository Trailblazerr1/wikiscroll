{"title":"Carpetbagger","summary":"In the history of the United States, carpetbagger is a largely historical term used by Southerners to describe opportunistic Northerners who came to the Southern states after the American Civil War, who were perceived to be exploiting the local populace for their own financial, political, and/or social gain. The term broadly included both individuals who sought to promote Republican politics (including the right of African Americans to vote and hold office), and individuals who saw business and political opportunities because of the chaotic state of the local economies following the war. In practice, the term carpetbagger was often applied to any Northerner who was present in the South during the Reconstruction Era (1865â€“1877). The term is closely associated with \"scalawag\", a similarly pejorative word used to describe native White Southerners who supported the Republican Party-led Reconstruction.","image":"Carpetbagger.jpg.webp","url":"Carpetbagger"}
