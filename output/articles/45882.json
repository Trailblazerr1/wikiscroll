{"title":"Treehouse of Horror VI","summary":"\"Treehouse of Horror VI\" is the sixth episode of the seventh season of the American animated television series The Simpsons, and the sixth episode in the Treehouse of Horror series. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 29, 1995, and contains three self-contained segments. In \"Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores\", an ionic storm brings Springfield's oversized advertisements and billboards to life and they begin attacking the town. The second segment, \"Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace\", is a parody of the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which Groundskeeper Willie (resembling Freddy Krueger) attacks schoolchildren in their sleep. In the third and final segment, \"Homer3\", Homer finds himself trapped in a three-dimensional world. It was inspired by the 1962 The Twilight Zone episode \"Little Girl Lost\". The segments were written by John Swartzwelder, Steve Tompkins, and David S. Cohen respectively.","image":"PaulAnka07.jpg.webp","url":"Treehouse_of_Horror_VI"}
