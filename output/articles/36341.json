{"title":"Protoplanetary disk","summary":"A protoplanetary disk is a rotating circumstellar disc of dense gas and dust surrounding a young newly formed  star, a T Tauri star, or Herbig Ae/Be star. The protoplanetary disk may also be considered an accretion disk for the star itself, because gases or other material may be falling from the inner edge of the disk onto the surface of the star. This process should not be confused with the accretion process thought to build up the planets themselves. Externally illuminated photo-evaporating protoplanetary disks are called proplyds.","image":"HL_Tau_protoplanetary_disk.jpg.webp"}
