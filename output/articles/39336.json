{"title":"Sandro Botticelli","summary":"Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi (c. 1445[1] – May 17, 1510), known as Sandro Botticelli (/ˌboʊtiˈtʃɛli/, Italian: [ˈsandro bottiˈtʃɛlli]), was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance.  Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th  century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting.","image":"Sandro_Botticelli_083.jpg.webp","url":"Sandro_Botticelli"}
