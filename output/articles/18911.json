{"title":"Green Park","summary":"The Green Park, usually known without the definite article simply as Green Park, is one of the Royal Parks of London. It is in the southern part – the core part – of the City of Westminster, Central London, but before that zone was extended to the north, to take in Marylebone and Paddington it lay in its north-centre. It is north of the gardens and the semi-circular forecourt of Buckingham Palace.","image":"Green_Park%2C_London_-_April_2007.jpg.webp"}
