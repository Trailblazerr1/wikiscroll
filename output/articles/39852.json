{"title":"Second Cold War","summary":"The Second Cold War,[1][2] or Cold War II,[3][4] or the New Cold War,[5][6][7] are synonymous terms used by various commentators to describe the heightened 21st century political and military tensions between the United States and China. It is also used to describe such tensions between the US and Russia, a state of the former Soviet Union, which was one of the major parties of the original Cold War until its dissolution in 1991. Some commentators have used the term as a comparison to the original Cold War. Some other commentators have either doubted that either tension would lead to another \"cold war\" or have discouraged using the term to refer to either or both tensions.","image":"Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg.png.webp","url":"Second_Cold_War"}
