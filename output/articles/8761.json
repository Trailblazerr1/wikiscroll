{"title":"Cars 2","summary":"Cars 2 is a 2011 American 3D computer-animated spy[3] action-adventure comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. It is a sequel to 2006's Cars and the second film in the Cars franchise. This was the final Pixar film animated with their old software system, Marionette, before officially replaced with Presto in 2012. It was directed by John Lasseter, written by Ben Queen, and produced by Denise Ream.[4][5][6] In the film's ensemble voice cast, Owen Wilson, Larry the Cable Guy, Tony Shalhoub, Guido Quaroni, Bonnie Hunt, and John Ratzenberger reprise their roles from the first film. Paul Newman, who voiced Doc Hudson in the previous film, died in September 2008, so his character was written out of the film; George Carlin, who previously voiced Fillmore, died during the same year, and his role was passed to Lloyd Sherr. The returning cast is joined by Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, John Turturro, Eddie Izzard, and Thomas Kretschmann, who voice the new characters introduced in this film.","image":"Cars_2_Poster.jpg.webp","url":"Cars_2"}
