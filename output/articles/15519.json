{"title":"Expected value","summary":"In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n, often denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        ⁡\n        (\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} (X)}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        ⁡\n        [\n        X\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} [X]}\n  \n, or \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle EX}\n  \n, is a generalization of the weighted average, and is intuitively the arithmetic mean of a large number of independent realizations of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n. The expectation operator \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} }\n  \n is also commonly stylized as \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E}\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {E} }\n  \n.[1][2][3] The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, mean, average, or first moment. Expected value is a key concept in economics, finance, and many other subjects.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg"}
