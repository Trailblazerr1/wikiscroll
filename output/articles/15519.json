{"title":"Expected value","summary":"In probability theory, the expected value of a random variable X {\\displaystyle X} , often denoted E ⁡ ( X ) {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} (X)} , E ⁡ [ X ] {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} [X]} , or E X {\\displaystyle EX} , is a generalization of the weighted average, and is intuitively the arithmetic mean of a large number of independent realizations of X {\\displaystyle X} . The expectation operator E {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {E} } is also commonly stylized as E {\\displaystyle E} or E {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {E} } .[1][2][3] The expected value is also known as the expectation, mathematical expectation, mean, average, or first moment. Expected value is a key concept in economics, finance, and many other subjects.","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Expected_value"}
