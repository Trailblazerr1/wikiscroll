{"title":"Fresco","summary":"Fresco (plural frescos or frescoes) is a technique of mural painting executed upon freshly laid (\"wet\") lime plaster. Water is used as the vehicle for the dry-powder pigment to merge with the plaster, and with the setting of the plaster, the painting becomes an integral part of the wall. The word fresco (Italian: affresco) is derived from the Italian adjective fresco meaning \"fresh\", and may thus be contrasted with fresco-secco or secco mural painting techniques, which are applied to dried plaster, to supplement painting in fresco. The fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with Italian Renaissance painting.[1][2]","image":"Creación_de_Adán_(Miguel_Ángel).jpg.webp","url":"Fresco"}
