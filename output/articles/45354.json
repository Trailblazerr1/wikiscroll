{"title":"Toki Pona","summary":"Toki Pona (rendered as toki pona,[lower-alpha 1] literally \"good language\", \"simple language\" or \"the language of good\"; IPA: [ˈtoki ˈpona] (listen); English: /ˈtoʊki ˈpoʊnə/) is a philosophical artistic constructed language (or philosophical artlang) known for its small vocabulary, simplicity and ease of acquisition.[3] It was created by Canadian linguist and translator Sonja Lang[3] for the purpose of simplifying thoughts and communication and was first published online in 2001 as a draft,[1] and in a more complete form in the book Toki Pona: The Language of Good in 2014.[4][5] In July 2021, Lang released a supplementary dictionary, based on community usage, called the Toki Pona Dictionary. A small community of speakers developed in the early 2000s.[6][7] While activity mostly takes place online in chat rooms, on social media, and in other groups, there were a few organized in-person meetings during the 2000s[1] and 2010s.","image":"Toki_pona.svg.png.webp","url":"Toki_Pona"}
