{"title":"Scharnhorst-class battleship","summary":"The Scharnhorst class was a class of German battleships (or battlecruisers) built immediately prior to World War II. The first capital ships of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine,  it comprised two vessels: Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. Scharnhorst was launched first,[1] and is considered to be the lead ship by some sources; they are also referred to as the Gneisenau class in some other sources,[2] as Gneisenau was the first to be laid down and commissioned.[1] They marked the beginning of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles. The ships were armed with nine 28 cm (11 in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets; plans to replace these with six 38 cm (15 in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets were never realized.","image":"Scharnhorst-1-A503-FM30-50.jpg.webp","url":"Scharnhorst-class_battleship"}
