{"title":"Great Vowel Shift","summary":"The Great Vowel Shift was a series of changes in the pronunciation of the English language that took place primarily between 1400 and 1700, beginning in southern England and today having influenced effectively all dialects of English. Through this vowel shift, the pronunciation of all Middle English long vowels was changed. Some consonant sounds changed as well, particularly those that became silent; the term Great Vowel Shift is sometimes used to include these consonant changes.[1][2]","image":"Great_Vowel_Shift.svg.png.webp","url":"Great_Vowel_Shift"}
