{"title":"American Cream Draft","summary":"The American Cream Draft is an American breed of draft horse, characterized by the cream or \"gold champagne\" color of its coat. It was developed in Iowa during the early twentieth century from a cream-colored mare named Old Granny. A breed registry was formed in 1944, but became inactive for several decades when breed numbers dropped due to the mechanization of farming. It was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then. It is a rare breed: its conservation status is considered critical by The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust.","image":"ACD_Horses_in_Parade.jpg.webp"}
