{"title":"Bicycle-sharing system","summary":"A bicycle-sharing system, bike share program [1], public bicycle scheme,[2] or public bike share (PBS) scheme,[3] is a shared transport service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a \"dock\" and return it at another dock belonging to the same system. Docks are special bike racks that lock the bike, and only release it by computer control. The user enters payment information, and the computer unlocks a bike. The user returns the bike by placing it in the dock, which locks it in place. Other systems are dockless.","image":"00_2141_Bicycle-sharing_systems_-_Sweden.jpg.webp"}
