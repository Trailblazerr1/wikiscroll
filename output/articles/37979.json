{"title":"Rigor mortis","summary":"Rigor mortis (Latin: rigor \"stiffness\", and mortis \"of death\"), or postmortem rigidity, is the third stage of death. It is one of the recognizable signs of death, characterized by stiffening of the limbs of the corpse caused by chemical changes in the muscles postmortem (mainly calcium).[1] In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as four hours after death. Contrary to folklore and common belief, rigor mortis is not permanent and begins to pass within hours of onset. Typically, it lasts no longer than eight hours at \"room temperature\".","image":"People_Dead_1991_in_Sandwip.jpg.webp"}
