{"title":"Milk chocolate","summary":"Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa, sugar and milk. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage since pre-Columbian times, and since its introduction to Western Europe however, innovations in technology (namely the invention of \"Dutch Cocoa\" and powdered milk) led to the invention of milk chocolate by Swiss chocolatier Daniel Peter in 1875. Major milk chocolate producers include Ferrero, Hershey, Mondelez, Mars and Nestl√©. Between them, they are responsible for over half of the chocolate sold worldwide. Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United States and Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin America. While taste and texture have been key to its success, milk chocolate has also historically been promoted as a healthy food, particularly for children. Recent evidence has shown that it may provide antioxidant health benefits.","image":"Milk_chocolate.jpg.webp"}
