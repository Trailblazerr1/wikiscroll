{"title":"Hammerhead shark","summary":"The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks that form the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a \"hammer\" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna, while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many, but not necessarily mutually exclusive, functions have been postulated for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. The cephalofoil gives the shark superior binocular vision and depth perception.[2]","image":"Scalloped_Hammerhead_Shark_Sphyrna_Lewini_(226845659).jpeg.webp","url":"Hammerhead_shark"}
