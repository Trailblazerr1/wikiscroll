{"title":"Auld Lang Syne","summary":"\"Auld Lang Syne\" (Scots pronunciation: [ˈɔːl(d) lɑŋˈsəin]: note \"s\" rather than \"z\")[1] is a popular song, particularly in the English-speaking world. Traditionally it is sung to bid farewell to the old year at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. By extension, it is also often heard at funerals, graduations, and as a farewell or ending to other occasions; for instance many branches of the Scouting movement use it to close jamborees and other functions.[2]","image":"John_Masey_Wright_-_John_Rogers_-_Robert_Burns_-_Auld_Lang_Syne_crop.jpg.webp"}
