{"title":"Ichthyophthirius multifiliis","summary":"Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, often termed \"Ich\",[1][2] is a parasitic ciliate described by the French parasitologist Fouquet in 1876. Only one species is found in the genus which also gave name to the family. The name literally translates as \"the fish louse with many children\". The parasite can infect most freshwater fish species and, in contrast to many other parasites, shows very low host specificity. It penetrates gill epithelia, skin and fins of the fish host and resides as a feeding stage (the trophont) inside the epidermis. It is visible as a white spot on the surface of the fish but, due to its internal microhabitat, it is a true endoparasite and not an ectoparasite.[3]","image":"Ichthyophthiriasis.jpg.webp"}
