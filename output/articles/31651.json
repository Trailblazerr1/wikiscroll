{"title":"Neoclassical synthesis","summary":"The neoclassical synthesis (NCS), neoclassicalâ€“Keynesian synthesis,[1] or just neo-Keynesianism was a post-World War II academic movement and paradigm in economics that worked towards reconciling the macroeconomic thought of John Maynard Keynes with neoclassical economics.[2] Being Keynesian in the short run and neoclassical in the long run, neoclassical synthesis allowed the economy to adjust via fiscal and monetary policies in the short run (especially focusing on fiscal policies that were considered to be more effective than monetary ones) whilst predicting that equilibrium in the long run will be reached without state intervention.[3] The synthesis, formulated by a group of economists (most notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson), dominated economics in the post-war period and formed the mainstream of macroeconomic thought in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.[4]","image":"Philipsus60.png.webp","url":"Neoclassical_synthesis"}
