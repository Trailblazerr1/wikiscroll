{"title":"Korematsu v. United States","summary":"Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), was a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court to uphold the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast Military Area during World War II. The decision has widely been criticized,[1] with some scholars describing it as \"an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry\"[2] and as \"a stain on American jurisprudence\".[3] Chief Justice John Roberts explicitly repudiated the Korematsu decision in his majority opinion in the 2018 case of Trump v. Hawaii.[4] The case is often cited as one of the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time.[5][6]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp","url":"Korematsu_v._United_States"}
