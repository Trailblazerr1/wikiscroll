{"title":"Doolittle Raid","summary":"The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, was an air raid on 18 April 1942 by the United States on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on Honshu during World War II. It was the first air operation to strike the Japanese archipelago. It demonstrated that the Japanese mainland was vulnerable to American air attacks, served as retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor, and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned by, led by, and named after Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle (later a Lieutenant General in the US Army Air Forces and the US Air Force Reserve).","image":"B-25_bomber_by_James_Doolittle_took_off_from_the_USS_Hornet_for_Doolittle_Raid_in_1942.jpg.webp","url":"Doolittle_Raid"}
