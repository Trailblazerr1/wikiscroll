{"title":"Communicating sequential processes","summary":"In computer science, communicating sequential processes (CSP) is a formal language for describing patterns of interaction in concurrent systems.[1] It is a member of the family of mathematical theories of concurrency known as process algebras, or process calculi, based on message passing via channels. CSP was highly influential in the design of the occam programming language[1][2] and also influenced the design of programming languages such as Limbo,[3] RaftLib, Erlang,[4] Go,[5][3] Crystal, and Clojure's core.async.[6]","image":"133b76d8df4af3950a3007361949b0d8495e0ae1.svg"}
