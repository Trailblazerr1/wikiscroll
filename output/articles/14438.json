{"title":"Electrical resistance and conductance","summary":"The electrical resistance of an object is a measure of its opposition to the flow of electric current. Its reciprocal quantity is electrical conductance, measuring the ease with which an electric current passes. Electrical resistance shares some conceptual parallels with mechanical friction. The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm (Ω), while electrical conductance is measured in siemens (S) (formerly called 'mhos' and then represented by ℧).","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp","url":"Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"}
