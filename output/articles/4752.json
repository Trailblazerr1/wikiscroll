{"title":"Asturian language","summary":"Asturian (/æˈstjʊəriən/; asturianu [astuˈɾjanʊ],[3] formerly also known as bable [ˈbaβlɪ]) is a West Iberian Romance language spoken in the Principality of Asturias, Spain.[4] Asturian is part of a wider linguistic group, the Astur-Leonese languages. The number of speakers is estimated at 100,000 (native) and 450,000 (second language).[5] The dialects of the Astur-Leonese language family are traditionally classified in 3 groups: Western, Central, and Eastern. For historical and demographic reasons, the standard is based on Central Asturian. Asturian has a distinct grammar, dictionary, and orthography. It is regulated by the Academy of the Asturian Language. Although it is not an official language of Spain[6] it is protected under the Statute of Autonomy of Asturias and is an elective language in schools.[7] For much of its history, the language has been ignored or \"subjected to repeated challenges to its status as a language variety\" due to its lack of official status.[8]","image":"Mapa_de_la_estensión_de_la_llingua_asturiana-lleonesa.png.webp"}
