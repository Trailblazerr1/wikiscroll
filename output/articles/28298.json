{"title":"Manila Light Rail Transit System","summary":"The Manila Light Rail Transit System (Filipino: Sistema ng Magaang Riles Panlulan ng Maynila), commonly known as the LRT, is an urban rail transit system that primarily serves Metro Manila, Philippines.  Although categorized as a light rail system because it originally used light rail vehicles, it presently has characteristics of a rapid transit system, such as high passenger throughput, exclusive right-of-way, and later use of full metro rolling stock. The LRT is jointly-operated by the Light Rail Transit Authority (LRTA), a government corporation attached to the Department of Transportation (DOTr), and the Light Rail Manila Corporation (LRMC). Along with the Manila Metro Rail Transit System and the Metro Commuter Line of the Philippine National Railways, the system makes up Metro Manila's rail infrastructure.","image":"Lrtalogo.svg.png.webp"}
