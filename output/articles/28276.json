{"title":"Manganese dioxide","summary":"Manganese dioxide is the inorganic compound with the formula MnO2. This blackish or brown solid occurs naturally as the mineral pyrolusite, which is the main ore of manganese and a component of manganese nodules. The principal use for MnO2 is for dry-cell batteries, such as the alkaline battery and the zinc–carbon battery.[4] MnO2 is also used as a pigment and as a precursor to other manganese compounds, such as KMnO4.  It is used as a reagent in organic synthesis, for example, for the oxidation of allylic alcohols. MnO2 is α polymorph that can incorporate a variety of atoms (as well as water molecules) in the \"tunnels\" or \"channels\" between the manganese oxide octahedra. There is considerable interest in α-MnO2 as a possible cathode for lithium-ion batteries.[5][6]","image":"Manganese(IV)_oxide.jpg.webp","url":"Manganese_dioxide"}
