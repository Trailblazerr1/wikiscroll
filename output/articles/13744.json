{"title":"Dulce de leche","summary":"Dulce de leche (Spanish: [ˈdulse ðe ˈletʃe/ˈdulθe ðe ˈletʃe]; Portuguese: doce de leite IPA: [ˈdosi dʒi ˈlejtʃi]), also known as caramelized milk or milk jam in English, is a confection from Latin America prepared by slowly heating sugar and milk over a period of several hours. The resulting substance, which takes on a spreadable, sauce-like consistency, derives its rich flavour and colour from non-enzymatic browning.[3][4] It is typically used to top or fill other sweet foods.","image":"DulceDeLeche.jpg.webp"}
