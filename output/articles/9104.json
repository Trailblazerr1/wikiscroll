{"title":"Central venous catheter","summary":"A central venous catheter (CVC), also known as a  central line, central venous line, or central venous access catheter, is a catheter placed into a large vein. It is a form of venous access. Placement of larger catheters in more centrally located veins is often needed in critically ill patients, or in those requiring prolonged intravenous therapies, for more reliable vascular access. These catheters are commonly placed in veins in the neck (internal jugular vein), chest (subclavian vein or axillary vein), groin (femoral vein), or through veins in the arms (also known as a PICC line, or peripherally inserted central catheters).","image":"Blausen_0181_Catheter_CentralVenousAccessDevice_NonTunneled.png.webp"}
