{"title":"Hose (clothing)","summary":"Hose are any of various styles of men's clothing for the legs and lower body, worn from the Middle Ages through the 17th century, when the style fell out of use in favour of breeches and stockings. (See also trousers.) The old plural form of \"hose\" was \"hosen\". In German these terms (Hose, singular, and Hosen, plural) remained in use and are the generic terms for trousers today. The French equivalent was chausses.","image":"Particoloredhose.jpg.webp","url":"Hose_(clothing)"}
