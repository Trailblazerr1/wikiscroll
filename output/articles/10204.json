{"title":"Classification yard","summary":"A classification yard (American and Canadian English (Canadian National Railway use)) or marshalling yard (British, Hong Kong, Indian, Australian, and Canadian English (Canadian Pacific Railway use)) or shunting yard (Central Europe) is a railway yard found at some freight train stations, used to separate railway cars onto one of several tracks.  First the cars are taken to a track, sometimes called a lead or a drill.  From there the cars are sent through a series of switches called a ladder onto the classification tracks.  Larger yards tend to put the lead on an artificially built hill called a hump to use the force of gravity to propel the cars through the ladder.","image":"UP_DO_NOT_HUMP.jpg.webp","url":"Classification_yard"}
