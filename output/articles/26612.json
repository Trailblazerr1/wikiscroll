{"title":"List of Seattle Mariners managers","summary":"There have been 20 managers in the history of the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. The Mariners franchise was formed in 1977 as a member of the American League.[1] Darrell Johnson was hired as the first Mariners manager, serving for just over three seasons before being replaced during the 1980 season. In terms of tenure, Lou Piniella has managed more games and seasons than any other coach in their franchise history. He managed the Mariners to four playoff berths (1995, 1997, 2000 and 2001), led the team to the American League Championship Series in 1995, 2000 and 2001, and won the Manager of the Year award in 1995 and 2001.[2] Piniella is the only manager in Mariners history to lead a team into the playoffs, with one of those times after a 116-win season, tying the record for most wins in a season.[3] None of the previous managers had made it to the playoffs before. Piniella, however, managed the team in 34 playoff games, winning 15, and losing 19.[4][5][6][7] Dick Williams is the only Mariners manager to have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.","image":"Lou_Piniella_-_2008_-_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Seattle_Mariners_managers"}
