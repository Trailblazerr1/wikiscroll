{"title":"Levite","summary":"A Levite (or Levi)[2] (/ˈliːvaɪt/, Hebrew: לֵוִי‎, Modern: Levi, Tiberian: Lēwî) is a Jewish male who claims  patrilineal descent from the Tribe of Levi.[3] The Tribe of Levi descended from Levi, the third son of Jacob and Leah. The surname Halevi, which consists of the Hebrew definite article \"ה‎\" Ha- (\"the\") plus Levi (Levite) is not conclusive regarding being a Levite; a titular use of HaLevi indicates being a Levite. The daughter of a Levite is a \"Bat Levi\" (Bat being Hebrew for \"daughter\").","image":"Flag_of_Israel.svg.png.webp","url":"Levite"}
