{"title":"Base on balls","summary":"A base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls balls, and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out.  The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules,[1] and further detail is given in 6.08(a).[2]  It is  considered a faux pas for a professional player to literally walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.[3][4]","image":"Rashad_eldridge_draws_a_walk.jpg.webp"}
