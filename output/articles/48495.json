{"title":"Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner","summary":"Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner are a duo of cartoon characters from the Looney Tunes  series of animated cartoons. In each episode, the cunning, devious and constantly hungry Coyote repeatedly attempts to catch and subsequently eat the Road Runner, but is successful (in catching the Road Runner, not eating it) only on extremely rare occasions.[12] Instead of his animal instincts, the Coyote uses absurdly complex contraptions (sometimes in the manner of Rube Goldberg) to try to catch his prey, which comically backfire, with the Coyote often getting injured in slapstick fashion. Many of the items for these contrivances are mail-ordered from a variety of companies that are all named Acme Corporation.","image":"Tobeepornottobeep.jpg.webp","url":"Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner"}
