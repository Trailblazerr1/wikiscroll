{"title":"Bell test","summary":"A Bell test, also known as Bell inequality test or Bell experiment, is a real-world physics experiment designed to test the theory of quantum mechanics in relation to Albert Einstein's concept of local realism.  The experiments test whether or not the real world satisfies local realism, which requires the presence of some additional local variables (called \"hidden\" because they are not a feature of quantum theory) to explain the behavior of particles like photons and electrons. To date, all Bell tests have found that the hypothesis of local hidden variables is inconsistent with the way that physical systems behave.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg"}
