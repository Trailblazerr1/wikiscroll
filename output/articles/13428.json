{"title":"Doo-wop","summary":"Doo-wop (also spelled doowop and doo wop) is a genre of rhythm and blues music that originated among African-American youth in the 1940s,[1] mainly in the large cities of the United States, including New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Newark, Detroit, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles.[2][3] It features vocal group harmony that carries an engaging melodic line to a simple beat with little or no instrumentation. Lyrics are simple, usually about love, sung by a lead vocal over background vocals, and often featuring, in the bridge, a melodramatically heartfelt recitative addressed to the beloved. Harmonic singing of nonsense syllables (such as \"doo-wop\") is a common characteristic of these songs.[4] Gaining popularity in the 1950s, doo-wop was \"artistically and commercially viable\" until the early 1960s, but continued to influence performers in other genres.[5]","image":"Frankie_Lymon_and_the_Teenagers.jpg.webp"}
