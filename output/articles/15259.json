Along with several other genera in the tribe Eucalypteae, including Corymbia, they are commonly known as eucalypts.[3] Plants in the genus Eucalyptus have bark that is either smooth, fibrous, hard or stringy, leaves with oil glands, and sepals and petals that are fused to form a \"cap\" or operculum over the stamens. The fruit is a woody capsule commonly referred to as a \"gumnut\".","image":"Eucalyptus_tereticornis_flowers%2C_capsules%2C_buds_and_foliage.jpeg.webp"}
