{"title":"Spark-ignition engine","summary":"A spark-ignition engine (SI engine) is an internal combustion engine, generally a petrol engine, where the combustion process of the air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from a spark plug. This is in contrast to compression-ignition engines, typically diesel engines, where the heat generated from compression together with the injection of fuel is enough to initiate the combustion process, without needing any external spark.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
