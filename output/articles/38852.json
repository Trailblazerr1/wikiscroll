{"title":"s-process","summary":"The slow neutron-capture process, or s-process, is a series of reactions in nuclear astrophysics that occur in stars, particularly asymptotic giant branch stars. The s-process is responsible for the creation (nucleosynthesis) of approximately half the atomic nuclei heavier than iron.","image":"Nucleosynthesis_periodic_table.svg.png.webp","url":"S-process"}
