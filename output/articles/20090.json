{"title":"Henry Purcell","summary":"Henry Purcell (/ˈpɜːrsəl, pərˈsɛl/;[1] c. 10 September 1659[n 1] – 21 November 1695[2]) was an English composer. Although it incorporated Italian and French stylistic elements, Purcell's was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no later native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst, William Walton and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.","image":"Henry_Purcell_Closterman.jpg.webp"}
