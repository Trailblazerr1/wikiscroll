{"title":"Daniel (biblical figure)","summary":"Daniel (Aramaic and Hebrew: דָּנִיֵּאל‎ – Dānīyyēʾl,[lower-alpha 1] meaning \"God is my Judge\"; Greek: Δανιήλ Daniḗl), the hero of the biblical Book of Daniel, is a noble Jewish youth of Jerusalem taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, serving the king and his successors with loyalty and ability until the time of the Persian conqueror Cyrus, all the while remaining true to the God of Israel.[1] The consensus of most modern scholars is that Daniel is not an historical figure and that the book is a cryptic allusion to the reign of the 2nd century BCE Hellenistic king Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[2][3]","image":"Daniellion.jpg.webp","url":"Daniel_(biblical_figure)"}
