{"title":"Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution","summary":"The Ninth Amendment (Amendment IX) to the United States Constitution addresses rights, retained by the people, that are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. It is part of the Bill of Rights. The amendment was introduced during the drafting of the Bill of Rights when some of the American founders became concerned that future generations might argue that, because a certain right was not listed in the Bill of Rights, it did not exist. However, the Ninth Amendment has rarely played any role in U.S. constitutional law, and until the 1980s was often considered \"forgotten\" or \"irrelevant\" by many legal academics.[1][2]","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp"}
