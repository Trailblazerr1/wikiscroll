{"title":"Balaur bondoc","summary":"Balaur bondoc is a species of theropod dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period, in what is now Romania. It is the type species of the monotypic genus Balaur, after the balaur (Romanian pronunciation: [baˈla.ur][1]), a dragon of Romanian folklore. The specific name bondoc (Romanian pronunciation: [bonˈdok][2]) means \"stocky\", so Balaur bondoc means \"stocky dragon\" in Romanian. This name refers to the greater musculature that Balaur had compared to its relatives. The genus, which was first described by scientists in August 2010, is known from two partial skeletons (including the type specimen).","image":"Balaur_bondoc_1.jpg.webp"}
