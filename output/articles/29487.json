{"title":"Metallicity","summary":"In astronomy, metallicity is the abundance of elements present in an object that are heavier than hydrogen and helium. Most of the normal physical matter in the Universe is either hydrogen or helium, and astronomers use the word \"metals\" as a convenient short term for \"all elements except hydrogen and helium\". This word-use is distinct from the conventional chemical or physical definition of a metal as an electrically conducting solid. Stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of heavier elements are called \"metal-rich\" in astrophysical terms, even though many of those elements are nonmetals in chemistry.","image":"A_Swarm_of_Ancient_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000930.jpg.webp"}
