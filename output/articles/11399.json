{"title":"Cradle of civilization","summary":"A cradle of civilization is any location where civilization is understood to have independently emerged. According to current thinking, there was no single \"cradle\" of civilization; instead, several cradles of civilization developed independently. Mesopotamia, Ancient Egypt, Ancient India, and  Ancient China  are believed to be the earliest in the Old World.[1][2][3] The extent to which there was significant influence between the early civilizations of the Near East and the Indus Valley with the Chinese civilization of East Asia (Far East) is disputed.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
