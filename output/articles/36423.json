{"title":"Psychological projection","summary":"Psychological projection is the process of misinterpreting what is \"inside\" as coming from \"outside\".[1] It forms the basis of empathy by the projection of personal experiences to understand someone else's subjective world.[1] In its malignant forms, it is a defense mechanism in which the ego defends itself against disowned and highly negative parts of the self by denying their existence in themselves and attributing them to others, breeding misunderstanding and causing untold interpersonal damage.[2] A bully may project their own feelings of vulnerability onto the target, or a person who is confused may project feelings of confusion and inadequacy onto other people. Projection incorporates blame shifting and can manifest as shame dumping.[3] Projection has been described as an early phase of introjection.[4]","image":"Freud's_couch%2C_London%2C_2004_(2).jpeg.webp","url":"Psychological_projection"}
