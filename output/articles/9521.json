{"title":"Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel","summary":"The Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel (CBBT) is a 17.6-mile (28.3 km) bridge–tunnel crossing at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, the Hampton Roads harbor, and nearby mouths of the James and Elizabeth rivers in the U.S. state of Virginia. It connects Northampton County on the Delmarva Peninsula and Eastern Shore with Virginia Beach, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth on the western shore and south side/Tidewater, which are part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of eight close cities around the harbor's shores and peninsula. The bridge–tunnel originally combined 12 miles (19 km) of trestle, two one-mile-long (1.6 km) tunnels, four artificial islands, four high-level bridges, approximately two miles (3.2 km) of causeway, and 5.5 miles (8.9 km) of northeast and southwest approach roads crossing the Chesapeake Bay and preserving traffic on the Thimble Shoals and Chesapeake dredged shipping channels leading to the Atlantic. It replaced vehicle ferry services that operated from South Hampton Roads and from the Virginia Peninsula since the 1930s. Financed by toll revenue bonds, the bridge-tunnel was opened on April 15, 1964,[1] and remains one of only 12 bridge–tunnel systems in the world, three of which are located in the water-dominated Hampton Roads area of Tidewater Virginia.","image":"2017-07-12_11_23_10_View_south_along_U.S._Route_13_(Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge-Tunnel)_crossing_the_North_Channel_of_the_Chesapeake_Bay_in_Northampton_County%2C_Virginia.jpg.webp"}
