{"title":"Class action","summary":"A class action, also known as a class-action lawsuit, class suit, or representative action, is a type of lawsuit where one of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by a member or members of that group. The class action originated in the United States and is still predominantly a U.S. phenomenon, but Canada, as well as several European countries with civil law, have made changes in recent years to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers.","image":"Old_and_new_London_-_a_narrative_of_its_history%2C_its_people%2C_and_its_places_(1873)_(14598096217).jpg.webp"}
