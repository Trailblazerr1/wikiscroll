{"title":"Salon (gathering)","summary":"A salon is a gathering of people held by an inspiring host. During the gathering they amuse one another and increase their knowledge through conversation. These gatherings often consciously followed Horace's definition of the aims of poetry, \"either to please or to educate\" (Latin: aut delectare aut prodesse). Salons in the tradition of the French literary and philosophical movements of the 17th and 18th centuries were carried on until as recently as the 1920s in urban settings.","image":"Abraham_Bosse_Salon_de_dames.jpg.webp","url":"Salon_(gathering)"}
