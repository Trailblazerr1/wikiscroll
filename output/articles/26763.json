{"title":"List of census divisions of Ontario","summary":"The first-level administrative divisions of Ontario, of which there are 51, consist of three types: single-tier municipalities, upper-tier municipalities (which can be regional municipalities or counties), and districts. These differ primarily in the services that they provide to their residents, and their different structures result from the vast disparities among Ontario's different regions. They may comprise smaller municipalities or other types of administrative divisions, which are generally treated as census subdivisions by Statistics Canada.","image":"Ontario_census_divisions_by_type.png.webp","url":"List_of_census_divisions_of_Ontario"}
