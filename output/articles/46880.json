{"title":"Upper house","summary":"An upper house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the lower house.[1] The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller and often has more restricted power than the lower house. A legislature composed of only one house (and which therefore has neither an upper house nor a lower house) is described as unicameral.","image":"L'hémicycle_du_Sénat_français_en_septembre_2009.jpg.webp","url":"Upper_house"}
