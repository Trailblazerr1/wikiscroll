{"title":"Commodity fetishism","summary":"In Marxist philosophy, the term commodity fetishism describes the relationships of production and exchange as social relationships among things (money and merchandise) and not as relationships among people. As a form of reification, commodity fetishism presents value as inherent to the commodities, and not arising from the interpersonal relations that produced the commodity.[1][2] Commodity fetishism is presented in the first chapter of Capital: Critique of Political Economy (1867) to explain that the social organization of labour is mediated through market exchange, the buying and selling of goods and services (commodities); thus, capitalist social relations among people—who makes what, who works for whom, the production-time for a commodity, etc.—are social relations among objects.[3]","image":"La_Boqueria.JPG.webp","url":"Commodity_fetishism"}
