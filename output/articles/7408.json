{"title":"Brahma Sutras","summary":"The Brahma Sūtras (Sanskrit: ब्रह्म सूत्र) is a Sanskrit text, attributed to the sage Badarayana or sage Vyasa, estimated to have been completed in its surviving form in approx. 400–450 CE, [1] while the original version might be ancient and composed between 500 BCE and 200 BCE.[2][3] The text systematizes and summarizes the philosophical and spiritual ideas in the Upanishads.[4] The sage Adi Shankara's interpretation of the Brahmasutra attempted to synthesize diverse and sometimes apparently conflicting teachings of the Upanishads by arguing, as John Koller states: \"that Brahman and Atman are, in some respects, different, but, at the deepest level, non-different (advaita), being identical.\" This view of Vedanta, however, was not universal in Indic thought, and other commentators later held differing views.[5] It is one of the foundational texts of the Vedānta school of Hindu philosophy.[4]","image":"Om_symbol.svg.png.webp","url":"Brahma_Sutras"}
