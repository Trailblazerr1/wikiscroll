{"title":"Acronym","summary":"An acronym is a word or name formed from the initial components of a longer name or phrase. Acronyms are usually formed from the initial letters of words, as in NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and EU (the European Union), but sometimes use syllables, as in Benelux (short for Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg). They can also be a mixture, as in radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging).","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
