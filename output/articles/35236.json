{"title":"Pleasant Dreams","summary":"Pleasant Dreams is the sixth studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, released on July 20, 1981, through Sire Records. While the band members wanted Steve Lillywhite to produce, Sire chose Graham Gouldman in an attempt to gain popularity through a well-known producer. The recording process brought about many conflicts between band members, most notably the strife between Joey Ramone and Johnny Ramone, due to Johnny starting a relationship with Joey's girlfriend. There were also disputes about the overall direction of the album, with Johnny leaning towards hard rock and Joey towards pop music. Ultimately, the album incorporated high production values and varying musical styles, straying from traditional punk rock on songs such as \"We Want the Airwaves\", \"She's a Sensation\" and \"Come On Now\".","image":"Ramones_-_Pleasant_Dreams_cover.jpg.webp"}
