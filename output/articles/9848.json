{"title":"Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)","summary":"The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)[note 1] is a mainline Protestant Christian denomination in the United States and Canada.[2][3] The denomination started with the Restoration Movement during the Second Great Awakening, first existing during the 19th century as a loose association of churches working towards Christian unity, then slowly forming quasi-denominational structures through missionary societies, regional associations, and an international convention. In 1968, the Disciples of Christ officially adopted a denominational structure at which time a group of churches left to remain nondenominational.","image":"Disciples_of_Christ_Chalice_1.svg.png.webp","url":"Christian_Church_(Disciples_of_Christ)"}
