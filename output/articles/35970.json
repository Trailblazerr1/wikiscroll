{"title":"Priapism","summary":"Priapism is a condition in which a penis remains erect for hours in the absence of stimulation or after stimulation has ended.[3] There are three types: ischemic (low-flow), nonischemic (high-flow), and recurrent ischemic (intermittent).[3] Most cases are ischemic.[3] Ischemic priapism is generally painful while nonischemic priapism is not.[3] In ischemic priapism, most of the penis is hard; however, the glans penis is not.[3] In nonischemic priapism, the entire penis is only somewhat hard.[3] Very rarely, clitoral priapism occurs in women.[4]","image":"Pompeya_er√≥tica6.jpg.webp"}
