{"title":"Redneck","summary":"Redneck is a derogatory term chiefly, but not exclusively, applied to white Americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the Southern United States.[1][2] Its meaning stems from the sunburn found on farmers' necks dating back to the late 19th century. Its usage is similar in meaning to cracker (especially regarding Texas, Georgia, and Florida), hillbilly (especially regarding Appalachia and the Ozarks),[3] and white trash (but without the last term's suggestions of immorality).[4][5][6] In Britain, the Cambridge Dictionary definition states: \"A poor, white person without education, esp. one living in the countryside in the southern US, who is believed to have prejudiced ideas and beliefs. This word is usually considered offensive.\"[7] People from the white South sometimes jocularly call themselves \"rednecks\" as insider humor.[8]","image":"Sunburn_Treatment_Practices.jpg.webp"}
