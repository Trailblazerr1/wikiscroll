{"title":"Castellammarese War","summary":"The Castellammarese War (Italian pronunciation: [kaˌstɛllammaːˈreze]) was a bloody power struggle for control of the Italian-American Mafia that took place in New York City, New York, from February 1930 until April 15, 1931, between partisans of Joe \"The Boss\" Masseria and those of Salvatore Maranzano. The war was named after the Sicilian town of Castellammare del Golfo, the birthplace of Maranzano.[1] Maranzano's faction won and divided New York's crime families into the Five Families; Maranzano declared himself capo di tutti i capi (\"boss of all bosses\"). However, Maranzano was murdered in September 1931 on orders of Lucky Luciano, who established a power-sharing arrangement called the Commission, a group of Mafia families of equal stature, to avoid such wars in the future.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Castellammarese_War"}
