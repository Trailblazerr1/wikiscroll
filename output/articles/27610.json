{"title":"Lumberjack","summary":"Lumberjacks are mostly North American workers in the logging industry who perform the initial harvesting and transport of trees for ultimate processing into forest products. The term usually refers to loggers in the era (before 1945 in the United States) when trees were felled using hand tools and dragged by oxen to rivers. The work was difficult, dangerous, intermittent, low-paying, and involved living in primitive conditions. However, the men built a traditional culture that celebrated strength, masculinity, confrontation with danger, and resistance to modernization.[1]","image":"A_lumberjack_standing_at_the_base_of_a_huge_tree_showing_a_cut_in_the_tree%2C_ca.1900_(CHS-3368).jpg.webp"}
