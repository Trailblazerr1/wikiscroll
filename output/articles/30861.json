{"title":"Murder, Inc.","summary":"Murder, Inc. (Murder, Incorporated) was an organized crime group, active from 1929 to 1941, that acted as the enforcement arm of the Italian-American Mafia, the Jewish Mob, and other closely connected organized crime groups in New York City and elsewhere.[1] The group was composed of Jewish-American and Italian-American gangsters, and members were mainly recruited from poor and working-class Jewish and Italian neighborhoods in Manhattan (primarily the Lower East Side) and from the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Brownsville, East New York, and Ocean Hill. It was initially headed by Louis \"Lepke\" Buchalter and later by Albert \"The Mad Hatter\" Anastasia. Murder, Inc. was believed to be responsible for between 400 and 1,000 contract killings,[2] until the group was exposed in 1941 by former group member Abe \"Kid Twist\" Reles. Murder, Inc. committed hundreds of murders on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during 1929 through 1941. In the trials that followed, many members were convicted and executed, and Abe Reles himself died after suspiciously falling from a window. Thomas E. Dewey first came to prominence as a prosecutor of Murder, Inc. and other organized crime cases.[3]","image":"Jacob_Shapiro_%26_Louis_Buchalter_1937-11-08_wanted_poster.JPG.webp"}
