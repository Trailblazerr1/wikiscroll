{"title":"Xun Kuang","summary":"Xun Kuang (Chinese: 荀況; pinyin: Xún Kuàng [ɕy̌n kʰwâŋ]; c. 310 – c. 235 BCE, alt. c. 314 – c. 217 BCE),[1] also widely known as Xunzi (Chinese: 荀子; pinyin: Xúnzǐ; Wade–Giles: Hsün-tzu, \"Master Xun\"), was a Chinese Confucian philosopher and writer who lived during the Warring States period and contributed to the Hundred Schools of Thought. A book known as the Xunzi is traditionally attributed to him. His works survive in an excellent condition, and were a major influence in forming the official state doctrines of the Han dynasty,[2] but his influence waned during the Tang dynasty relative to that of Mencius.[3]","image":"Portrait_of_Xun_Zi.jpg.webp","url":"Xun_Kuang"}
