{"title":"Kathak","summary":"Kathak is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance. The origin of Kathak is traditionally attributed to the traveling bards in the of ancient northern India known as Kathakars or storytellers.[1] The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means \"story\", and Kathakar which means \"the one who tells a story\", or \"to do with stories\".[1][2] Wandering Kathakars communicated stories from the great epics and ancient mythology through dance, songs and music.[2] Kathak dancers tell various stories through their hand movements and extensive footwork, their body movements and flexibility but most importantly through their facial expressions. Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.[1][3] Kathak is unique in having both Hindu and Muslim gharanas and cultural elements of these gharanas.[4] Kathak performances include Urdu Ghazals and commonly used instruments brought during the Mughal period.[5]","image":"Kathak_Performance.jpg.webp","url":"Kathak"}
