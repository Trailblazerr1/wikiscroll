{"title":"Millennium","summary":"A millennium (plural millennia or millenniums) is a period of one thousand years,[1] sometimes called a kiloannum (ka), or kiloyear (ky). Sometimes, the word is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year \"1\") and at later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after the start point. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Millennia sometimes have religious or theological implications (see millenarianism).","image":"\"All_aboard_for_the_millennium!\"_-_Opper_and_Keppler._LCCN2012648532_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Millennium"}
