{"title":"Great Lakes","summary":"The Great Lakes (French: Grands Lacs), also called the Great Lakes of North America or the Laurentian Great Lakes,[1] is a series of large interconnected freshwater lakes in the upper mid-east region of North America that connect to the Atlantic Ocean via the Saint Lawrence River. They are Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario and are in general on or near the Canadaâ€“United States border.  Hydrologically, there are four lakes, because lakes Michigan and Huron join at the Straits of Mackinac. The Great Lakes Waterway enables travel by water among the lakes.","image":"Great_Lakes_from_space_crop_labeled.jpg.webp"}
