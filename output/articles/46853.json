{"title":"Unix time","summary":"Unix time (also known as Epoch time, Posix time,[1] seconds since the Epoch,[2] or UNIX Epoch time[3]) is a system for describing a point in time. It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, excluding leap seconds. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 (an arbitrary date). Unix time is nonlinear with a leap second having the same Unix time as the second before it (or after it, implementation dependent), so that every day is treated as if it contains exactly 86400 seconds,[2] with no seconds added to or subtracted from the day as a result of positive or negative leap seconds. Due to this treatment of leap seconds, Unix time is not a true representation of UTC.","image":"1000000000seconds.jpg.webp","url":"Unix_time"}
