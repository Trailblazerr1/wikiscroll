He contributed to the birth of Brazil's bossa nova movement, and several of his samba pieces, such as \"Samba da Minha Terra\", \"Doralice\" and \"Saudade da Bahia\", have become staples of música popular brasileira.[1] Equally notable are his ballads celebrating the fishermen and women of Bahia, including \"Promessa de Pescador\", \"O Que É Que a Baiana Tem?\", and \"Milagre\". Caymmi composed about 100 songs in his lifetime, and many of his works are now considered to be Brazilian classics. Both Brazilian and non-Brazilian musicians have covered his songs.","image":"Dorival_caymmi_1938.jpg.webp"}
