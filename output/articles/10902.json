{"title":"Conga","summary":"The conga, also known as  tumbadora, is a tall, narrow, single-headed drum from Cuba. Congas are staved like barrels and classified into three types: quinto (lead drum, highest), tres dos or tres golpes (middle), and tumba or salidor (lowest). Congas were originally used in Afro-Cuban music genres such as conga (hence their name) and rumba, where each drummer would play a single drum. Following numerous innovations in conga drumming and construction during the mid-20th century, as well as its internationalization, it became increasingly common for drummers to play two or three drums. Congas have become a popular instrument in many forms of Latin music such as son (when played by conjuntos), descarga, Afro-Cuban jazz, salsa, songo, merengue and Latin rock.","image":"Collectie_Nationaal_Museum_van_Wereldculturen_TM-6335-1a_Enkelvellige_tonvormige_buistrom%2C_onderdeel_van_een_set_Cuba.jpg.webp"}
