{"title":"Beta particle","summary":"A beta particle, also called beta ray or beta radiation (symbol β), is a high-energy, high-speed electron or positron emitted by the radioactive decay of an atomic nucleus during the process of beta decay. There are two forms of beta decay, β− decay and β+ decay, which produce electrons and positrons respectively.[2]","image":"Alfa_beta_gamma_radiation.svg.png.webp"}
