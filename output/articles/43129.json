{"title":"Synoptic Gospels","summary":"The gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are referred to as the synoptic Gospels because they include many of the same stories, often in a similar sequence and in similar or sometimes identical wording. They stand in contrast to John, whose content is largely distinct. The term synoptic (Latin: synopticus; Greek: συνοπτικός, romanized: synoptikós) comes via Latin from the Greek σύνοψις, synopsis, i.e. \"(a) seeing all together, synopsis\";[n 1] the sense of the word in English, the one specifically applied to these three gospels, of \"giving an account of the events from the same point of view or under the same general aspect\" is a modern one.[1]","image":"Brooklyn_Museum_-_Jesus_Stilling_the_Tempest_(Jésus_calmant_la_tempête)_-_James_Tissot_-_overall.jpg.webp"}
