{"title":"Tutti Frutti (song)","summary":"\"Tutti Frutti\" (Italian: \"All fruits\") is a song written by Little Richard and Dorothy LaBostrie that was first recorded in 1955, becoming Little Richard's first major hit record. With its energetic refrain, often transcribed as \"A-wop-bop-a-loo-mop-a-lop-bam-boom!\" (a verbal rendition of a drum pattern that Little Richard had imagined),[2] and its hard-driving sound and wild lyrics, it became not only a model for many future Little Richard songs, but also a model for rock and roll itself.[3] The song introduced several of rock music's most characteristic musical features, including its loud volume, powerful vocal style, and distinctive beat and rhythm.[4]","image":"Tuttifruitti.jpg.webp","url":"Tutti_Frutti_(song)"}
