{"title":"SMS Gneisenau","summary":"SMS Gneisenau[lower-alpha 1] was an armored cruiser of the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), part of the two-ship  Scharnhorst class. Named for the earlier screw corvette of the same name, the ship was laid down in June 1904 at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen, launched in June 1906, and commissioned in March 1908. She was armed with a main battery of eight 21 cm (8.3 in) guns, a significant increase in firepower over earlier German armored cruisers, and she had a top speed of 22.5 knots (42 km/h; 26 mph). Gneisenau initially served with the German fleet in I Scouting Group, though her service there was limited owing to the British development of the battlecruiser by 1909, which the less powerful armored cruisers could not effectively combat.","image":"SMS_Gneisenau_before_World_War_I.jpg.webp"}
