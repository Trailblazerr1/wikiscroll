{"title":"Isoelectric point","summary":"The isoelectric point (pI, pH(I), IEP), is the pH at which a molecule carries no net electrical charge or is electrically neutral in the statistical mean. The standard nomenclature to represent the isoelectric point is pH(I).[1] However, pI is also used.[2] For brevity, this article uses pI.  The net charge on the molecule is affected by pH of its surrounding environment and can become more positively or negatively charged due to the gain or loss, respectively, of protons (H+).","image":"c79afa0a98ac2410789dd5ca58437bd4b0320b09.svg"}
