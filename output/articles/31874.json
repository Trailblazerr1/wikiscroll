{"title":"New York City Hall","summary":"New York City Hall is the seat of New York City government, located at the center of City Hall Park in the Civic Center area of Lower Manhattan, between Broadway, Park Row, and Chambers Street. Constructed from 1803 to 1812,[1] the building is the oldest city hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions,[5] such as the office of the Mayor of New York City and the chambers of the New York City Council.  While the Mayor's Office is in the building, the staff of thirteen municipal agencies under mayoral control are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, one of the largest government buildings in the world, with many others housed in various buildings in the immediate vicinity.","image":"New_York_City_Hall_exterior%2C_October_2016.jpg.webp"}
