{"title":"Basal metabolic rate","summary":"Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the rate of energy expenditure per unit time by endothermic animals at rest.[1] It is reported in energy units per unit time ranging from watt (joule/second) to ml O2/min or joule per hour per kg body mass J/(hÂ·kg). Proper measurement requires a strict set of criteria be met. These criteria include being in a physically and psychologically undisturbed state, in a thermally neutral environment, while in the post-absorptive state (i.e., not actively digesting food).[1] In bradymetabolic animals, such as fish and reptiles, the equivalent term standard metabolic rate (SMR) is used. It follows the same criteria as BMR, but requires the documentation of the temperature at which the metabolic rate was measured. This makes BMR a variant of standard metabolic rate measurement that excludes the temperature data, a practice that has led to problems in defining \"standard\" rates of metabolism for many mammals.[1]","image":"Indirect_calorimetry_laboratory_with_canopy_hood.jpg.webp"}
