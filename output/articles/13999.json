{"title":"East German uprising of 1953","summary":"The East German uprising of 1953 (German: Volksaufstand vom 17. Juni 1953â€‰) was an uprising that occurred in East Germany from 16 to 17 June 1953. It began with a strike action by construction workers in East Berlin on 16 June against work quotas during the Sovietization process in East Germany. Demonstrations in East Berlin turned into a widespread uprising against the Government of East Germany and the Socialist Unity Party the next day, involving over one million people in about 700 localities across the country.[2] Protests against declining living standards and unpopular Sovietization policies led to a wave of strikes and protests that were not easily brought under control and threatened to overthrow the East German government. The uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the Soviet forces in Germany and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, while demonstrations continued in over 500 towns and villages for several more days before dying out.","image":"Bundesarchiv_B_145_Bild-F005191-0040%2C_Berlin%2C_Aufstand%2C_sowjetischer_Panzer.jpg.webp","url":"East_German_uprising_of_1953"}
