{"title":"Pointe technique","summary":"Pointe technique (/pwænt/ pwant[1]) is the part of classical ballet technique that concerns pointe work, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet within pointe shoes. A dancer is said to be en pointe (/ɒ̃-, ɒn-, ɑːn ˈpwænt/) when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be en pointe when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's weight load throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully vertical feet.","image":"EnPointeFoot.jpg.webp"}
