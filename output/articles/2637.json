{"title":"Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act","summary":"The Alaska Mental Health Enabling Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-830) was an Act of Congress passed to improve mental health care in the United States territory of Alaska. It became the focus of a major political controversy[1] after opponents nicknamed it the \"Siberia Bill\" and denounced it as being part of a communist plot to hospitalize and brainwash Americans. Campaigners asserted that it was part of an international Jewish, Roman Catholic or psychiatric conspiracy intended to establish United Nations-run concentration camps in the United States.","image":"1956_Alaska_Mental_Health_Enabling_Act.JPG.webp"}
