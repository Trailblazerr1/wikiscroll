{"title":"Tefillin","summary":"Tefillin (/ˈtfɪlɪn/; Israeli Hebrew: תְּפִלִּין / תְּפִילִּין; Askhenazic pronunciation: [tfiˈlin]) or phylacteries, is a set of small black leather boxes containing scrolls of parchment inscribed with verses from the Torah. Tefillin are worn by observant adult Jews during weekday morning prayers. In Orthodox communities, they are worn solely by men, while some Reform and  Conservative (Masorti) communities allow for them to be worn by both men and women, strictly speaking, for any 'time bound' commandment (those that are performed at a specific time) women are absolved from.","image":"A_set_of_Tefillin.jpg.webp"}
