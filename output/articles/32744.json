{"title":"Odyssey","summary":"The Odyssey (/ˈɒdəsi/;[1] Ancient Greek: Ὀδύσσεια, romanized: Odýsseia, Attic Greek: [o.dýs.seː.a]) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is one of the oldest extant works of literature still read by contemporary audiences. As with the Iliad, the poem is divided into 24 books. It follows the Greek hero Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and his journey home after the Trojan War. After the war itself, which lasted ten years, his journey lasted for ten additional years, during which time he encountered many perils and all his crew mates were killed. In his absence, Odysseus was assumed dead, and his wife Penelope and son Telemachus had to contend with a group of unruly suitors who were competing for Penelope's hand in marriage.","image":"Odyssey-crop.jpg.webp","url":"Odyssey"}
