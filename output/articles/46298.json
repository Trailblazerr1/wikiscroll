{"title":"Typhoon Haiyan","summary":"Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Yolanda, was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded. On making landfall, Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines.[1] It is one of the deadliest Philippine typhoons on record,[2] killing at least 6,300 people in that country alone.[3] In terms of JTWC-estimated 1-minute sustained winds, Haiyan is tied with Meranti in 2016 for being the second strongest landfalling tropical cyclone on record only behind Goni of 2020. In January 2014, bodies were still being found.[4] Haiyan was also the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2013.","image":"Haiyan_Nov_7_2013_1345Z_(Borderless).png.webp","url":"Typhoon_Haiyan"}
