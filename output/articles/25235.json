{"title":"LOL","summary":"LOL, or lol, is an initialism for laughing out loud[1][2][3] and a popular element of Internet slang. It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO[4] (\"laughing my ass off\") and ROFL[5][6][7] or ROTFL[8][9] (\"rolling on the floor laughing\"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete \"lots of luck\" or \"lots of love\" used in letter-writing.[10]","image":"Lol_LOL.png.webp","url":"LOL"}
