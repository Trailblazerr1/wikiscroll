{"title":"Interchange (road)","summary":"In the field of road transport, an interchange is a road junction that uses grade separations to allow for the movement of traffic between two or more roadways or highways, using a system of interconnecting roadways to permit traffic on at least one of the routes to pass through the junction without interruption from crossing traffic streams. It differs from a standard intersection, where roads cross at grade. Interchanges are almost always used when at least one road is a controlled-access highway (freeway or motorway) or a limited-access divided highway (expressway), though they are sometimes used at junctions between surface streets.","image":"Lakalaivan_eritasoliittym√§_1.jpg.webp","url":"Interchange_(road)"}
