{"title":"Plant hormone","summary":"Plant hormones (or phytohormones) are signal molecules, produced within plants, that occur in extremely low concentrations. Plant hormones control all aspects of plant growth and development, from embryogenesis,[1] the regulation of organ size, pathogen defense,[2][3] stress tolerance[4][5] and through to reproductive development.[6] Unlike in animals (in which hormone production is restricted to specialized glands) each plant cell is capable of producing hormones.[7][8] Went and Thimann coined the term \"phytohormone\" and used it in the title of their 1937 book.[9]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
