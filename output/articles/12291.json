{"title":"Day trading","summary":"Day trading is a form of speculation in securities in which a trader buys and sells a financial instrument within the same trading day, so that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. Traders who trade in this capacity are generally classified as speculators. Day trading contrasts with the long-term trades underlying buy-and-hold and value investing strategies.[1][2] It is made easier using day trading software.[3]","image":"NASDAQ_IXIC_-_dot-com_bubble_small.png.webp","url":"Day_trading"}
