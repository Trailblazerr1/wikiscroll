{"title":"Cirrhosis","summary":"Cirrhosis, also known as liver cirrhosis or hepatic cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease, is the impaired liver function caused by the formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis due to damage caused by liver disease.[9] Damage causes tissue repair and subsequent formation of scar tissue, which over time can replace normal functioning tissue leading to the impaired liver function of cirrhosis.[9][10] The disease typically develops slowly over months or years.[1] Early symptoms may include tiredness, weakness, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and discomfort in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.[2] As the disease worsens, symptoms may include itchiness, swelling in the lower legs, fluid build-up in the abdomen,  jaundice, bruising easily, and the development of spider-like blood vessels in the skin.[2] The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become spontaneously infected.[1] More serious complications include hepatic encephalopathy, bleeding from dilated veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines, and liver cancer.[11]","image":"Hepaticfailure.jpg.webp","url":"Cirrhosis"}
