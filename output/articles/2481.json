{"title":"Air quality index","summary":"An Air Quality Index (AQI) is used by government agencies[1] to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become.[2][3] Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards. Some of these are the Air Quality Health Index (Canada), the Air Pollution Index (Malaysia), and the Pollutant Standards Index (Singapore).","image":"25August_2007_Greek_fires.jpg.webp"}
