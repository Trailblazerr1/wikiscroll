Wharton presided over the meeting.  Although the convention's agenda largely mirrored that of the Convention of 1832, delegates also agreed to pursue independent statehood for the province, which was at the time part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas. Under the guidance of Sam Houston, former governor of the US state of Tennessee, a committee drafted a state constitution to submit to the Mexican Congress. The proposed constitution was largely patterned on US political principles, yet retained several Spanish customs.  Delegates also requested customs exemptions and asked that a ban on immigration into Texas be lifted.","image":"Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_1852.jpg.webp","url":"Convention_of_1833"}
