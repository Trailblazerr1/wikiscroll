{"title":"Random number generation","summary":"Random number generation is a process by which, often by means of a random number generator (RNG), a sequence of numbers or symbols that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by random chance is generated. This means that the particular outcome sequence will contain some patterns detectable in hindsight but unpredictable to foresight. True random number generators can be hardware random-number generators (HRNGS) that generate random numbers, wherein each generation is a function of the current value of a physical environment's attribute that is constantly changing in a manner that is practically impossible to model. This would be in contrast to so-called \"random number generations\" done by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) that generate numbers that only look random but are in fact pre-determinedâ€”these generations can be reproduced simply by knowing the state of the PRNG.","image":"Two_red_dice_01.svg.png.webp","url":"Random_number_generation"}
