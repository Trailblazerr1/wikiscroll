{"title":"Glaucophyte","summary":"The glaucophytes, also known as glaucocystophytes or glaucocystids, are a small group of freshwater unicellular algae,[1] less common today than they were during the Proterozoic.[2] Only 15 species have been described, but more species are likely to exist.[3] Together with the red algae (Rhodophyta)  and the green algae plus land plants (Viridiplantae or Chloroplastida), they form the Archaeplastida.  However, the relationships among the red algae, green algae and glaucophytes are unclear,[4] in large part due to limited study of the glaucophytes.[5]","image":"Glaucocystis_sp.jpg.webp"}
