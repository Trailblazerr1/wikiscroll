{"title":"Sovereign state","summary":"A sovereign state is a political entity that is represented by one centralized government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states.[1] It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is independent.[2] According to the declarative theory of statehood, a sovereign state can exist without being recognised by other sovereign states.[3][4] Unrecognised states will often find it difficult to exercise full treaty-making powers or engage in diplomatic relations with other sovereign states.","image":"United_Nations_Members.svg.png.webp"}
