{"title":"Let It Go","summary":"\"Let It Go\" is a song from Disney's 2013 computer-animated feature film Frozen, whose music and lyrics were composed by husband-and-wife songwriting team Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. The song was performed in its original show-tune version in the film by American actress and singer Idina Menzel in her vocal role as Queen Elsa. It was later released as a single,[2][3] being promoted to adult contemporary radio by Walt Disney Records in January 2014.[4][5] Anderson-Lopez and Lopez also composed a simplified pop version (with shorter lyrics and background chorus) which was performed by actor and singer Demi Lovato over the start of the film's closing credits. Disney's music division planned to release Lovato's version of the song before Menzel's, as they did not consider Menzel's version a traditional pop song.[5] A music video was separately released for the pop version.","image":"Idina_Menzel_-_Let_It_Go.png.webp","url":"Let_It_Go"}
