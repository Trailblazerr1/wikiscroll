{"title":"First Great Awakening","summary":"The First Great Awakening (sometimes Great Awakening) or the Evangelical Revival was a series of Christian revivals that swept  Britain and its  thirteen North American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. The revival movement permanently affected Protestantism as adherents strove to renew individual piety and religious devotion. The Great Awakening marked the emergence of Anglo-American evangelicalism as a trans-denominational movement within the Protestant churches. In the United States, the term Great Awakening is most often used, while in the United Kingdom the movement is referred to as the Evangelical Revival.[1]","image":"Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God_by_Jonathan_Edwards_1741.jpg.webp","url":"First_Great_Awakening"}
