{"title":"Saurischia","summary":"Saurischia (/sɔːˈrɪskiə/ saw-RIS-kee-ə, meaning \"reptile-hipped\" from the Greek  sauros (σαῦρος) meaning 'lizard' and ischion (ἴσχιον) meaning 'hip joint')[1] is one of the two basic divisions of dinosaurs (the other being Ornithischia). In 1888, Harry Seeley classified dinosaurs into two orders, based on their hip structure,[2] though today most paleontologists classify Saurischia as an unranked clade rather than an order.[3]","image":"Saurischia.jpg.webp","url":"Saurischia"}
