{"title":"Black Moshannon State Park","summary":"Black Moshannon State Park is a 3,480-acre (1,410 ha) Pennsylvania state park in Rush Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. It surrounds Black Moshannon Lake, formed by a dam on Black Moshannon Creek, which has given its name to the lake and park. The park is just west of the Allegheny Front, 9 miles (14 km) east of Philipsburg on Pennsylvania Route 504, and is largely surrounded by Moshannon State Forest. A bog in the park provides a habitat for diverse wildlife not common in other areas of the state, such as carnivorous plants, orchids, and species normally found farther north. As home to the \"largest reconstituted bog in Pennsylvania\", it was chosen by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources for its \"25 Must-see Pennsylvania State Parks\" list.[7]","image":"Black_Moshannon_State_Park_(Revisited).jpg.webp","url":"Black_Moshannon_State_Park"}
