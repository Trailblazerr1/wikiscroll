{"title":"Stuffing","summary":"Stuffing, filling, or dressing is an edible mixture, often composed of herbs and a starch such as bread, used to fill a cavity in the preparation of another food item.  Many foods may be stuffed, including poultry, seafood, and vegetables.  As a cooking technique stuffing helps retain moisture, while the mixture itself serves to augment and absorb flavors during its preparation.","image":"Stuffing_a_turkey.jpg.webp"}
