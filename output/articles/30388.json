{"title":"Mono Lake","summary":"Mono Lake (/ˈmoʊnoʊ/ MOH-noh) is a saline soda lake in Mono County, California, formed at least 760,000 years ago as a terminal lake in an endorheic basin. The lack of an outlet causes high levels of salts to accumulate in the lake which make its water alkaline.","image":"Mono_Lake%2C_CA.jpg.webp","url":"Mono_Lake"}
