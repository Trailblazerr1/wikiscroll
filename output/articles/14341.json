{"title":"Eight-ball","summary":"Eight-ball (also spelled 8-ball or eightball, and sometimes called solids and stripes, spots and stripes[1] or rarely highs and lows) is a pool billiards played on a billiard table with six pockets, cue sticks, and sixteen billiard balls: a cue ball and fifteen object balls. The object balls include seven solid-colored balls numbered 1 through 7, seven striped balls numbered 9 through 15, and the black 8 ball. After the balls are scattered with a break shot, a player is assigned either the group of solid or striped balls once they have legally pocketed a ball from that group. The object of the game is to legally pocket the 8-ball in a \"called\" pocket, which can only be done after all of the balls from a player's assigned group have been cleared from the table.","image":"Eight_Ball_Rack_2005_SeanMcClean.jpg.webp"}
