{"title":"United States congressional delegations from Utah","summary":"Since Utah became a U.S. state in 1896, it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years. Before the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, senators were elected by the Utah State Legislature. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from each of Utah's four congressional districts. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Utah elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1850 to 1896.","image":"lossless-page1-220px-Utah_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png.webp","url":"United_States_congressional_delegations_from_Utah"}
