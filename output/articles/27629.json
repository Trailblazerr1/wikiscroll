{"title":"Lunar eclipse","summary":"A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow.[1] This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in syzygy) with Earth between the other two, and only on the night of a full moon. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to either node of its orbit.","image":"Total_lunar_eclipse_on_January_21%2C_2019_(45910439045)_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
