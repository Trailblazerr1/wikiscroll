{"title":"Nuremberg trials","summary":"The Nuremberg trials (German: NÃ¼rnberger Prozesse) were a series of military tribunals held following World War II by the Allied forces under international law and the laws of war. The trials were most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial, and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in the Holocaust and other war crimes. The trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.","image":"Color_photograph_of_judges'_bench_at_IMT.jpg.webp","url":"Nuremberg_trials"}
