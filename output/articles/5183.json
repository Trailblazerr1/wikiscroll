{"title":"B'Day","summary":"B'Day is the second studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was released to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday on September 4, 2006, in various countries and a day later in the United States by Columbia Records, Music World Entertainment, and Sony Urban Music. The album was originally planned as a follow-up to Beyoncé's 2003 solo debut Dangerously in Love to be released in 2004; however, it was delayed to accommodate the recording of Destiny's Child's final album Destiny Fulfilled (2004) and the singer's starring role in the 2006 film Dreamgirls. While on vacation after filming, Beyoncé began contacting various producers and rented Sony Music Studios, completing B'Day in two weeks.","image":"Beyoncé_-_B'Day.png.webp","url":"B'Day"}
