{"title":"Pig (zodiac)","summary":"The Pig (豬) or sometimes translated as the Boar is the twelfth of the 12-year cycle of animals which appear in Chinese zodiac, in relation to the Chinese calendar and system of horology, and paralleling the system of ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches.  Although the term \"zodiac\" (etymologically referring to a \"[circle of] little animals\") is used in the phrase \"Chinese zodiac\", there is a major difference between the Chinese usage and Western astrology: the zodiacal animals (including the zodiacal Pig) do not relate to the zodiac as the area of the sky that extends approximately 8° north or south (as measured in celestial latitude) of the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun, the Moon, and visible planets across the celestial sphere's  constellations, over the course of the year.","image":"Pig_(Chinese_characters).svg.png.webp","url":"Pig_(zodiac)"}
