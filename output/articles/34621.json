{"title":"Peter I Island","summary":"Peter I Island (Norwegian: Peter I Øy)[1] is an uninhabited volcanic island in the Bellingshausen Sea, 450 kilometres (280 mi) from continental Antarctica. It is claimed as a dependency of Norway, and along with Bouvet Island and Queen Maud Land comprises one of the three Norwegian dependent territories in the Antarctic and Subantarctic. Peter I Island is 11 by 19 kilometres (6.8 by 11.8 mi) long and 156 square kilometres (60 sq mi). The tallest peak is the ultra and 1,640-meter-tall (5,380 ft) Lars Christensen Peak. Nearly all of the island is covered by a glacier and it is surrounded most of the year by pack ice, making it inaccessible during these times. There is little vertebrate animal life on the island apart from some seabirds and seals.","image":"Antarctica%2C_Norway_territorial_claim_(Peter_I_Island).svg.png.webp","url":"Peter_I_Island"}
