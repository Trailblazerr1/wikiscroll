{"title":"Buenos Aires Province","summary":"Buenos Aires (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbwenos ˈajɾes]), officially the Buenos Aires Province (Provincia de Buenos Aires [pɾoˈβinsja ðe ˈβwenos ˈajɾes]), is the largest and most populous Argentine province. It takes its name from the city of Buenos Aires, the capital of the country, which used to be part of the province and the province's capital until it was federalized in 1880. Since then, in spite of bearing the same name, the province does not include Buenos Aires proper, though it does include all other parts of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The capital of the province is the city of La Plata, founded in 1882.","image":"Casco_urbano_fundacional_de_la_Ciudad_de_La_Plata.jpg.webp","url":"Buenos_Aires_Province"}
