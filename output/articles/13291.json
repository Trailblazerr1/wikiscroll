{"title":"Dodona","summary":"Dodona (/doʊˈdoʊnə/; Doric Greek: Δωδώνα, Dōdṓnā, Ionic and Attic Greek: Δωδώνη,[1] Dōdṓnē) in Epirus in northwestern Greece was the oldest Hellenic oracle, possibly dating to the second millennium BCE according to Herodotus. The earliest accounts in Homer describe Dodona as an oracle of Zeus. Situated in a remote region away from the main Greek poleis, it was considered second only to the Oracle of Delphi in prestige.","image":"Dodona-Greece-April-2008-107.JPG.webp"}
