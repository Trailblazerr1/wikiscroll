{"title":"Japanese asset price bubble","summary":"The Japanese asset price bubble (バブル景気, baburu keiki, \"bubble economy\") was an economic bubble in Japan from 1986 to 1991 in which real estate and stock market prices were greatly inflated.[1] In early 1992, this price bubble burst and Japan's economy stagnated. The bubble was characterized by rapid acceleration of asset prices and overheated economic activity, as well as an uncontrolled money supply and credit expansion.[2] More specifically, over-confidence and  speculation regarding asset and stock prices were closely associated with excessive monetary easing policy at the time.[3] Through the creation of economic policies that cultivated the marketability of assets, eased the access to credit, and encouraged speculation, the Japanese government started, prolonged and exacerbated the Japanese asset price bubble.[4]","image":"Tokyo_Tower_and_around_Skyscrapers.jpg.webp","url":"Japanese_asset_price_bubble"}
