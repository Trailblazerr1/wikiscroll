{"title":"Epidermis (botany)","summary":"The epidermis (from the Greek ἐπιδερμίς, meaning \"over-skin\") is a single layer of cells that covers the leaves, flowers, roots and stems of plants. It forms a boundary between the plant and the external environment. The epidermis serves several functions: it protects against water loss, regulate gas exchange, secretes metabolic compounds, and (especially in roots) absorbs water and mineral nutrients. The epidermis of most leaves shows dorsoventral anatomy: the upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions. Woody stems and some other stem structures such as potato tubers produce a secondary covering called the periderm that replaces the epidermis as the protective covering.","image":"Stem-histology-cross-section-tag.svg.png.webp","url":"Epidermis_(botany)"}
