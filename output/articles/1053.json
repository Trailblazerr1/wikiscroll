{"title":"Born again","summary":"Born again, or to experience the new birth, is a phrase, particularly in evangelicalism, that refers to \"spiritual rebirth\", or a regeneration of the human spirit. In contrast to one's physical birth, being \"born again\" is caused distinctly and separately by baptism in the Holy Spirit, not by baptism in water. It is a core doctrine of the denominations of the Methodist, Quaker, Baptist, and Pentecostal Church along with all other evangelical Christian denominations. All of these strongly believe Jesus' words in the Gospels: \"You must be born again before you can see, or enter, the Kingdom of Heaven.\"  Their doctrine also mandates that to be both \"born again\" and \"saved\" one must have a personal and intimate relationship with Jesus Christ.[1][2][3][4][5][6]","image":"Nicodemus_Jesus.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fBorn_again"}
