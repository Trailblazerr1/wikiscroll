{"title":"Qubit","summary":"In quantum computing, a qubit (/ˈkjuːbɪt/) or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information—the quantum version of the classic binary bit physically realized with a two-state device.  A qubit is a two-state (or two-level) quantum-mechanical system, one of the simplest quantum systems displaying the peculiarity of quantum mechanics.  Examples include the spin of the electron in which the two levels can be taken as spin up and spin down; or the polarization of a single photon in which the two states can be taken to be the vertical polarization and the horizontal polarization. In a classical system, a bit would have to be in one state or the other. However, quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in a coherent superposition of both states simultaneously, a property that is fundamental to quantum mechanics and quantum computing.","image":"279f5336e8dcc639125e7dda2410319b81c9bf94.svg"}
