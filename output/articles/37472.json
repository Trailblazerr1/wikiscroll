{"title":"Refrigerator","summary":"A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature. The refrigerator should be kept at or below 40 °F (4 °C) and the freezer should be regulated at 0 °F (-18 °C). Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. Optimum temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F).[1] A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half.","image":"Open_refrigerator_with_food_at_night.jpg.webp","url":"Refrigerator"}
