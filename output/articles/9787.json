{"title":"Chris Amon","summary":"Christopher Arthur Amon MBE (20 July 1943 â€“ 3 August 2016) was a New Zealand motor racing driver. He was active in Formula One racing in the 1960s and 1970s and is widely regarded as one of the best F1 drivers never to win a championship Grand Prix. His reputation for bad luck was such that fellow driver Mario Andretti once joked that \"if he became an undertaker, people would stop dying\".[1] Former Ferrari Technical Director Mauro Forghieri stated that Amon was \"by far the best test driver I have ever worked with. He had all the qualities to be a World Champion but bad luck just wouldn't let him be\".[2]","image":"AmonChris19730706.jpg.webp"}
