{"title":"Mobbing (animal behavior)","summary":"Mobbing in animals is an antipredator adaptation in which individuals of prey species mob a predator by cooperatively attacking or harassing it, usually to protect their offspring. A simple definition of mobbing is an assemblage of individuals around a potentially dangerous predator.[1] This is most frequently seen in birds, though it is also known to occur in many other animals such as the meerkat and some bovines.[2][3] While mobbing has evolved independently in many species, it only tends to be present in those whose young are frequently preyed upon.[2] This behavior may complement cryptic adaptations in the offspring themselves, such as camouflage and hiding. Mobbing calls may be used to summon nearby individuals to cooperate in the attack.","image":"Redtail_hawk_chased_by_crows_4391.jpg.webp"}
