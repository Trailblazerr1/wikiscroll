{"title":"Analytical Marxism","summary":"Analytical Marxism is an approach to Marxist theory that was prominent amongst English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the September Group of academics, so called because of their biennial September meetings to discuss common interests. Described by G.Â A. Cohen as \"non-bullshit Marxism\",[1] the group was characterized, in the words of David Miller, by \"clear and rigorous thinking about questions that are usually blanketed by ideological fog.\"[2] Members of this school seek to apply the techniques of analytic philosophy, along with tools of modern social science such as rational choice theory, to the elucidation of the theories of Karl Marx and his successors.","image":"Marx_and_Engels.jpg.webp","url":"Analytical_Marxism"}
