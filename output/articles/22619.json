{"title":"Italian Peninsula","summary":"The Italian Peninsula (Italian: penisola italica), also known as the Italic Peninsula or the Apennine Peninsula, is a peninsula extending from the southern Alps in the north to the central Mediterranean Sea in the south. It is nicknamed lo Stivale (the Boot). Three smaller peninsulas contribute to this characteristic shape, namely Calabria (the \"toe\"), Salento (the \"heel\") and Gargano (the \"spur\"). The backbone of the Italian Peninsula consists of the Apennine Mountains, from which it takes one of its names. The peninsula comprises much of Italy, and also includes the microstates of San Marino and Vatican City and the extraterritorial sovereign territory of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.","image":"Satellite_image_of_Italy_in_March_2003.jpg.webp"}
