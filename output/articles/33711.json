{"title":"Palestine Liberation Organization","summary":"The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO; Arabic: منظمة التحرير الفلسطينية‎, Munaẓẓamat at-Taḥrīr al-Filasṭīniyyah) is an organization founded in 1964 with the purpose of the \"liberation of Palestine\" through armed struggle. It is recognized as the \"sole legitimate representative\" of the Palestinian people by over 100 states with which it holds diplomatic relations,[5][6] and, as the official government of the State of Palestine, has enjoyed observer status at the United Nations since 1974.[7][8][9] Due to its activities, including violence aimed at Israeli civilians,[10][11][12][13][14] the PLO was declared by the United States to be a terrorist organization in 1987, although a presidential waiver has permitted contact since 1988.[15][16] In 1993, the PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, accepted UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and rejected \"violence and terrorism\". In response, Israel officially recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.[17] However, the PLO has employed violence in the years since 1993, particularly during the 2000–2005 Al-Aqsa Intifada. On 29 October 2018, the Palestinian Central Council suspended the recognition of Israel and halted security and economic coordination in all its forms with it.[18]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
