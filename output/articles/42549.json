{"title":"Stuttering","summary":"Stuttering, also known as stammering, is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, words, or phrases as well as involuntary silent pauses or blocks in which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds.[2] The term stuttering is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition, but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech, referred to by people who stutter as blocks, and the prolongation of certain sounds, usually vowels or semivowels. According to Watkins et al., stuttering is a disorder of \"selection, initiation, and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production\".[3] For many people who stutter, repetition is the main concern. The term \"stuttering\" covers a wide range of severity, from barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent oral communication. Almost 70 million people worldwide stutter,[4] about 1% of the world's population.[3]","image":"Stuttering_mobile_app.jpg.webp","url":"Stuttering"}
