{"title":"Magnitude (astronomy)","summary":"In astronomy, magnitude is a unitless measure of the brightness of an object in a defined passband, often in the visible or infrared spectrum, but sometimes across all wavelengths. An imprecise but systematic determination of the magnitude of objects was introduced in ancient times by Hipparchus.","image":"Iridium_flare_2008_08_11.jpg.webp"}
