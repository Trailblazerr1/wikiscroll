{"title":"Timing belt (camshaft)","summary":"A timing belt, timing chain, or cambelt is a part of an internal combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft(s) so that the engine's valves open and close at the proper times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. In an interference engine the timing belt or chain is also critical to preventing the piston from striking the valves. A timing belt is usually a toothed belt—a drive belt with teeth on the inside surface. A timing chain is a roller chain—using a chain drive.","image":"Ford_Cosworth_BDR_002.jpg.webp","url":"Timing_belt_(camshaft)"}
