{"title":"Sungrazing comet","summary":"A sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at perihelion â€“ sometimes within a few thousand kilometres of the Sun's surface. Although small sungrazers can completely evaporate during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong evaporation and tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.","image":"A_Unique_Hubble_View_of_Comet_ISON.jpg.webp"}
