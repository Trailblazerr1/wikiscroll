{"title":"Mirror symmetry (string theory)","summary":"In algebraic geometry and theoretical physics, mirror symmetry is a relationship between geometric objects called Calabi–Yau manifolds. The term refers to a situation where two Calabi–Yau manifolds look very different geometrically but are nevertheless equivalent when employed as extra dimensions of string theory.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"Mirror_symmetry_(string_theory)"}
