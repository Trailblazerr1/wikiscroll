{"title":"Electronegativity","summary":"Electronegativity, symbolized as Ï‡, is the tendency for an atom of a given chemical element to attract shared electrons (or electron density) when forming a chemical bond.[1] An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. The higher the associated electronegativity, the more an atom or a substituent group attracts electrons. Electronegativity serves as a simple way to quantitatively estimate the bond energy, and the sign and magnitude of a bond's chemical polarity, which characterizes a bond along the continuous scale from covalent to ionic bonding. The loosely defined term electropositivity is the opposite of electronegativity: it characterizes an element's tendency to donate valence electrons.","image":"Electrostatic_Potential.jpg.webp"}
