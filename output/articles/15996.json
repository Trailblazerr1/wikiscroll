{"title":"Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor","summary":"Ferdinand II (9 July 1578 – 15 February 1637) was Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, Hungary, and Croatia between the late 1610s and his death in 1637. He was the son of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, and Maria of Bavaria.  His parents were devout Catholics, and, in 1590, they sent him to study at the Jesuits' college in Ingolstadt, because they wanted to isolate him from the Lutheran nobles.  In July that same year (1590), when Ferdinand was 12 years old, his father died, and he inherited Inner Austria—Styria, Carinthia, Carniola and smaller provinces.  His cousin, the childless Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, who was the head of the Habsburg family, appointed regents to administer these lands.","image":"Portrait_of_Ferdinand_II%2C_Holy_Roman_Emperor_(Kunsthistorisches_Museum%2C_Wien).jpg.webp"}
