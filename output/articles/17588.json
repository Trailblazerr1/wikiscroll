{"title":"Gender pay gap","summary":"The gender pay gap or gender wage gap is the average difference between the remuneration for men and women who are working.  Women are generally considered to be paid less than men. There are two distinct numbers regarding the pay gap: non-adjusted versus adjusted pay gap. The latter typically takes into account differences in hours worked,  occupations chosen, education and job experience.[1] In the United States, for example, the non-adjusted average female's annual salary is 79% of the average male salary, compared to 95% for the adjusted average salary.[2][3][4][5]","image":"ProhibitionSign.svg.png.webp"}
