{"title":"All-terrain vehicle","summary":"An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a light utility vehicle (LUV),[1] a quad bike, or simply a quad, as defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI); is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars for steering control.  As the name implies, it is designed to handle a wider variety of terrain than most other vehicles.  Although it is a street-legal vehicle in some countries, it is not street-legal within most states, territories, and provinces of Australia, the United States or Canada.","image":"Four_wheeler.jpg.webp"}
