{"title":"Colugo","summary":"Colugos (/kəˈluːɡoʊ/)[2][3] are arboreal gliding mammals that are native to Southeast Asia. Their closest evolutionary relatives are primates. There are just two living species of colugos: the Sunda flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) and the Philippine flying lemur (Cynocephalus volans). These two species make up the entire family Cynocephalidae (/ˌsaɪnoʊˌsɛfəˈlaɪdi, -ˌkɛ-/)[4] and order Dermoptera. They are the most capable gliders of all gliding mammals. A fur-covered membrane, called a patagium, connects to the face, paws, and tail. This enables them to glide in the air for distances of up to 200 meters (650 feet) between trees.[5] They are also known as cobegos or flying lemurs. However, although colugos resemble and are nocturnal like some lemur species, they are not actually lemurs.","image":"Colugo_(Galeopterus_variegatus%2C_adult_female)%2C_Central_Catchment_Area%2C_Singapore_-_20060618.jpg.webp","url":"Colugo"}
