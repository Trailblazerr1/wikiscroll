{"title":"God's Son (album)","summary":"God's Son is the sixth studio album by American rapper Nas, released on December 13, 2002, by Ill Will and Columbia Records. Production took place during 2001 to 2002, and was handled by several producers, including Salaam Remi, Chucky Thompson, Ron Browz, Eminem, and The Alchemist. Partly inspired by Nas' feud with Jay-Z and the death of his mother in early 2002, God's Son covers lyrical themes such as religion, violence, and his own emotional experiences. It has been recognised by critics as some of Nas' most personal work.","image":"Nas-gods-son-music-album.jpg.webp","url":"God's_Son_(album)"}
