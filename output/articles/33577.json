{"title":"PCI Express","summary":"PCI Express (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), officially abbreviated as PCIe or PCI-e,[1] is a high-speed serial computer expansion bus standard, designed to replace the older PCI, PCI-X and AGP bus standards. It is the common motherboard interface for personal computers' graphics cards, hard disk drive host adapters, SSDs, Wi-Fi and Ethernet hardware connections.[2]  PCIe has numerous improvements over the older standards, including higher maximum system bus throughput, lower I/O pin count and smaller physical footprint, better performance scaling for bus devices, a more detailed error detection and reporting mechanism (Advanced Error Reporting, AER),[3] and native hot-swap functionality. More recent revisions of the PCIe standard provide hardware support for I/O virtualization.","image":"PCI_Express.svg.png.webp"}
