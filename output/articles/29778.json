{"title":"Microraptor","summary":"Microraptor (Greek, μικρός, mīkros: \"small\"; Latin, raptor: \"one who seizes\") is a genus of small, four-winged dromaeosaurid dinosaurs. Numerous well-preserved fossil specimens have been recovered from Liaoning, China. They date from the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation (Aptian stage), 120 million years ago. Three species have been named (M. zhaoianus, M. gui, and M. hanqingi), though further study has suggested that all of them represent variation in a single species, which is properly called M. zhaoianus. Cryptovolans, initially described as another four-winged dinosaur, is usually considered to be a synonym of Microraptor.[2]","image":"Microraptor_gui_holotype.png.webp","url":"Microraptor"}
