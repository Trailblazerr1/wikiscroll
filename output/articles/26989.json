{"title":"List of scientific publications by Albert Einstein","summary":"Albert Einstein (1879â€“1955) was a renowned theoretical physicist of the 20th century, best known for his theories of special relativity and general relativity.  He also made important contributions to statistical mechanics, especially his treatment of Brownian motion, his resolution of the paradox of specific heats, and his connection of fluctuations and dissipation.  Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made seminal contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, quantum field theory, primarily through his theoretical studies of the photon.[1]","image":"GeneralRelativityTheoryManuscript.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_scientific_publications_by_Albert_Einstein"}
