{"title":"Bell tower","summary":"A bell tower is a tower that contains one or more bells, or that is designed to hold bells even if it has none. Such a tower commonly serves as part of a church, and will contain church bells, but there are also many secular bell towers, often part of a municipal building, an educational establishment, or a tower built specifically to house a carillon. Church bell towers often incorporate clocks, and secular towers usually do, as a public service.","image":"Nurmij√§rven_kellotapuli.jpg.webp","url":"Bell_tower"}
