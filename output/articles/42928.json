{"title":"Susan B. Anthony dollar","summary":"The  Susan B. Anthony dollar is a United States dollar coin minted from 1979 to 1981 when production was suspended due to poor public acceptance, and then again in 1999. Intended as a replacement for the larger Eisenhower dollar, the new smaller one-dollar coin went through testing of several shapes and compositions, but all were opposed by the vending machine industry, a powerful lobby affecting coin legislation. Finally, a round planchet with an eleven-sided inner border was chosen for the smaller dollar.","image":"1981-S_SBA%24_Type_Two_Deep_Cameo.jpg.webp","url":"Susan_B._Anthony_dollar"}
