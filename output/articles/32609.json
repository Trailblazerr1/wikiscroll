{"title":"OK gesture","summary":"The OK gesture or OK sign or ring gesture (symbol/emoji: \"👌\") is performed by connecting the thumb and index into a circle, and holding the other fingers straight or relaxed away from the palm. Commonly used by divers, it signifies \"I am OK\" or \"Are you OK?\" when underwater. In most English-speaking countries it denotes approval, agreement, and that all is well or \"okay\". In other contexts or cultures, similar gestures may have different meanings or connotations including those that are negative, offensive, financial, numerical, devotional, political,[1] or purely linguistic.","image":"LG_WHISEN_손연재_지면_광고_촬영_사진_(30)_hand_only.jpg.webp"}
