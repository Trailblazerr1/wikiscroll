{"title":"Boltzmann's entropy formula","summary":"In statistical mechanics, Boltzmann's equation (also known as Boltzmann–Planck equation) is a probability equation relating the entropy S {\\displaystyle S} , also written as S B {\\displaystyle S_{\\mathrm {B} }} , of an ideal gas to the multiplicity (commonly denoted as Ω {\\displaystyle \\Omega } or W {\\displaystyle W} ), the number of real microstates corresponding to the gas's macrostate:","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg","url":"Boltzmann's_entropy_formula"}
