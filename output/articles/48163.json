{"title":"Wehrmacht","summary":"The Wehrmacht (German pronunciation: [ˈveːɐ̯maxt] (listen), lit. 'defence force') was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It consisted of the  Heer (army), the Kriegsmarine (navy) and the Luftwaffe (air force). The designation \"Wehrmacht\" replaced the previously-used term Reichswehr, and was the manifestation of the Nazi regime's efforts to rearm Germany to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.[11]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
