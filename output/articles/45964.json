{"title":"Trimurti","summary":"Trimūrti or Trideva (/trɪˈmʊərti/;[1] Sanskrit: त्रिमूर्ति trimūrti, \"three forms\" or \"trinity\") is the triple deity of supreme divinity in Hinduism,[2][3][4][5] in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities, typically Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer,[6][7] though individual denominations may vary from that particular line-up. The legendary yogi Dattatreya is often treated as not only one of the 24 avatars of Vishnu, but also of Shiva and Brahma as well in a single three-headed body.[8] The Om symbol of Hinduism is considered to have allusion to Trimurti, where A, U and M of the Om symbol are considered as creation, preservation and destruction.[9]","image":"Trimurti1940s.jpg.webp","url":"Trimurti"}
