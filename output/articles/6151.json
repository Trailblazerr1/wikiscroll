{"title":"Bell pepper","summary":"The bell pepper (also known as sweet pepper, pepper, or capsicum /ˈkæpsɪkəm/)[1] is the fruit of plants in the Grossum cultivar group of the species Capsicum annuum.[2][3] Cultivars of the plant produce fruits in different colors, including red, yellow, orange, green, white, and purple. Bell peppers are sometimes grouped with less pungent chili varieties as \"sweet peppers\".  While they are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used as a vegetable ingredient or side dish. The fruits of the Capsicum genus are categorized as chili peppers.","image":"Green-Yellow-Red-Pepper-2009.jpg.webp"}
