{"title":"Gino Bartali","summary":"Gino Bartali Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI[1] (Italian pronunciation: [ˈdʒiːno ˈbartali]; 18 July 1914 – 5 May 2000),[2] nicknamed Gino the Pious and (in Italy) Ginettaccio, was a champion road cyclist. He was the most renowned Italian cyclist before the Second World War, having won the Giro d'Italia twice, in 1936 and 1937, and the Tour de France in 1938. After the war, he added one more victory in each event: the Giro d'Italia in 1946 and the Tour de France in 1948. His second and last Tour de France victory in 1948 gave him the largest gap between victories in the race.[3]","image":"Gino_Bartali_1963.jpg.webp","url":"Gino_Bartali"}
