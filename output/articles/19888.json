{"title":"Heat wave","summary":"A heat wave, or heatwave,[1] is a period of excessively hot weather, which may be accompanied by high humidity, especially in oceanic climate countries.  While definitions vary,[2] a heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual weather in the area and relative to normal temperatures for the season. Temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be called a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal climate pattern for that area.[3]","image":"Global_tropical_cyclone_tracks-edit2.jpg.webp"}
