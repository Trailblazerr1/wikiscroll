{"title":"Dead-ball era","summary":"In baseball, the dead-ball era was the period from around 1900 to the emergence of Babe Ruth as a power hitter in 1919. That year, Ruth hit a then-league record 29 home runs. This era was characterized by low-scoring games and a lack of home runs. The lowest league run average in history was in 1908, when teams averaged only 3.4 runs per game. Teams played in spacious ball parks that limited hitting for power, and, compared to modern baseballs, the ball used then was \"dead\" both by design and from overuse. In addition, ball scuffing and adulteration by pitchers was not against the rules during this period.","image":"Ray_Caldwell_pitching_in_the_first_game_at_Ebbets_Field%2C_April_5%2C_1913.jpg.webp","url":"Dead-ball_era"}
