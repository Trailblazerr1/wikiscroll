{"title":"Mudrock","summary":"Mudrocks are a class of fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The varying types of mudrocks include siltstone, claystone, mudstone, slate, and shale. Most of the particles of which the stone is composed are less than 1⁄16 mm (0.0625 mm; 0.00246 in) and are too small to study readily in the field. At first sight, the rock types appear quite similar; however, there are important differences in composition and nomenclature.","image":"GLMsed.jpg.webp","url":"Mudrock"}
