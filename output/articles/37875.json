{"title":"Richard III (play)","summary":"Richard III is a play by William Shakespeare. It was probably written c. 1592â€“1594. It is labelled a history in the First Folio, and is usually considered one, but it is sometimes called a tragedy, as in the quarto edition. Richard III concludes Shakespeare's first tetralogy (also containing Henry VI, Part 1, Henry VI, Part 2, and Henry VI, Part 3) and depicts the Machiavellian rise to power and subsequent short reign of King Richard III of England.[1]","image":"Richardthird.jpg.webp"}
