{"title":"Law of excluded middle","summary":"In logic, the law of excluded middle (or the principle of excluded middle) states that for every proposition, either this proposition or its negation is true.[1][2] It is one of the  so called three laws of thought, along with the law of noncontradiction, and the law of identity. However, no system of logic is built on just these laws, and none of these laws provide inference rules, such as modus ponens or De Morgan's laws.","image":"f3e393a996208a8f0b298e841e2b486e09c5db35.svg"}
