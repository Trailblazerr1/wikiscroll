{"title":"Italy in the Middle Ages","summary":"The history of the Italian peninsula during the medieval period can be roughly defined as the time between the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the Italian Renaissance. The term \"Middle Ages\" itself ultimately derives from the description of the period of \"obscurity\" in Italian history during the 9th to 11th centuries, the saeculum obscurum or \"Dark Age\" of the Roman papacy[1] as seen from the perspective of the 14th to 15th century Italian Humanists.","image":"Le_Repubbliche_Marinare.jpg.webp","url":"Italy_in_the_Middle_Ages"}
