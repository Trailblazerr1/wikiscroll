{"title":"Nazi Party","summary":"The Nazi Party,[lower-alpha 1] officially the National Socialist German Workers' Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei[lower-alpha 2] or NSDAP), was a far-right[7][8] political party in Germany active between 1920 and 1945, that created and supported the ideology of Nazism. Its precursor, the German Workers' Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; DAP), existed from 1919 to 1920. The Nazi Party emerged from the German nationalist, racist and populist Freikorps paramilitary culture, which fought against the communist uprisings in post-World War I Germany.[9] The party was created to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism.[10] Initially, Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric. This was later downplayed to gain the support of business leaders, and in the 1930s the party's main focus shifted to antisemitic and anti-Marxist themes.[11]","image":"Parteiadler_Nationalsozialistische_Deutsche_Arbeiterpartei_(1933–1945).svg.png.webp"}
