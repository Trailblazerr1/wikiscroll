{"title":"Rubella vaccine","summary":"Rubella vaccine is a vaccine used to prevent rubella.[1] Effectiveness begins about two weeks after a single dose and around 95% of people become immune. Countries with high rates of immunization no longer see cases of rubella or congenital rubella syndrome. When there is a low level of childhood immunization in a population it is possible for rates of congenital rubella to increase as more women make it to child-bearing age without either vaccination or exposure to the disease. Therefore, it is important for more than 80% of people to be vaccinated.[1]","image":"Yes_check.svg.png.webp"}
