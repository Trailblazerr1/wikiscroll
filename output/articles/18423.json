{"title":"Gondwana","summary":"Gondwana ( /ɡɒndˈwɑːnə/)[1] or Gondwanaland[2] was a supercontinent that formed during the late Neoproterozoic (about 550 million years ago) and began to break up during the Jurassic (about 180 million years ago), with the final stages of breakup, including the opening of the Drake Passage separating South America and Antarctica occurring during the Paleogene. Gondwana was not considered a supercontinent by the earliest definition, since the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia, and Siberia were separated from it.[3]","image":"Gondwana_420_Ma.png.webp","url":"Gondwana"}
