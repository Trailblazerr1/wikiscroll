{"title":"Black Hills","summary":"The Black Hills (Lakota: Ȟe Sápa; Cheyenne: Moʼȯhta-voʼhonáaeva; Hidatsa: awaxaawi shiibisha[1]) are a small and isolated mountain range rising from the Great Plains of North America in western South Dakota and extending into Wyoming, United States.[2] Black Elk Peak (formerly known as Harney Peak), which rises to 7,244 feet (2,208 m), is the range's highest summit.[3] The Black Hills encompass the Black Hills National Forest. The name \"Black Hills\" is a translation of the Lakota Pahá Sápa. The hills are so called because of their dark appearance from a distance, as they are covered in evergreen trees.[4]","image":"Needles_Highway_05.jpg.webp","url":"Black_Hills"}
