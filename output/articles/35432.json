{"title":"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","summary":"A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is a hydrocarbon—a chemical compound containing only carbon and hydrogen—that is composed of multiple aromatic rings. The group is a major subset of the aromatic hydrocarbons. The simplest of such chemicals are naphthalene, having two aromatic rings, and the three-ring compounds anthracene and phenanthrene.  The terms polyaromatic  hydrocarbon[1] or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon[2] are also used for this concept.[3]","image":"Hexabenzocoronene.svg.png.webp"}
