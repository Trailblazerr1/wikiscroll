{"title":"Auguste Rodin","summary":"François Auguste René Rodin (12 November 1840 – 17 November 1917) was a French sculptor[1] generally considered the founder of modern sculpture.[2] He was schooled traditionally and took a craftsman-like approach to his work. Rodin possessed a unique ability to model a complex, turbulent, and deeply pocketed surface in clay. He is known for such sculptures as The Thinker, Monument to Balzac, The Kiss, The Burghers of Calais, and The Gates of Hell.","image":"Auguste_Rodin_by_George_Charles_Beresford_(NPG_x6573).jpg.webp"}
