{"title":"Wild Hunt","summary":"The Wild Hunt is a folklore motif (Motif E501 in Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature)[1] that historically occurs in the folklore of various northern European cultures. Wild Hunts typically involve a \"soul-raving\" chase led by a mythological figure escorted by a ghostly or supernatural group of hunters passing in wild pursuit.[2] The leader of the hunt is often a named figure associated with Odin in Germanic legends,[3][4] but may variously be a historical or legendary figure like Theodoric the Great, the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag, the Welsh psychopomp Gwyn ap Nudd, biblical figures such as Herod, Cain, Gabriel, or the Devil, or an unidentified lost soul or spirit either male or female. The hunters are generally the souls of the dead or ghostly dogs, sometimes fairies, Valkyries, or elves.[5][6][7]","image":"La_caza_salvaje_de_Od√≠n%2C_por_Peter_Nicolai_Arbo.jpg.webp","url":"Wild_Hunt"}
