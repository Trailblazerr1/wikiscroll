{"title":"Hahn–Banach theorem","summary":"The Hahn–Banach theorem is a central tool in functional analysis. \nIt allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace of some vector space to the whole space, and it also shows that there are \"enough\" continuous linear functionals defined on every normed vector space to make the study of the dual space \"interesting\". Another version of the Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem or the hyperplane separation theorem, and has numerous uses in convex geometry.","image":"49a4c4d225d57758700f8ee4d614884a47bfcd07.svg"}
