{"title":"Operation Payback","summary":"Operation Payback was a coordinated,[1] decentralized[2] group of attacks on high-profile[3] opponents of Internet piracy by Internet activists using the \"Anonymous\" moniker. Operation Payback started as retaliation to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on torrent sites; piracy proponents then decided to launch DDoS attacks on piracy opponents. The initial reaction snowballed into a wave of attacks on major pro-copyright and anti-piracy organizations, law firms, and individuals.","image":"You_call_it_piracy.jpg.webp","url":"Operation_Payback"}
