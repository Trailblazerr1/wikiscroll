{"title":"Disembowelment","summary":"Disembowelment or evisceration is the removal of some or all of the organs of the gastrointestinal tract (the bowels, or viscera), usually through a horizontal incision made across the abdominal area.  Disembowelment may result from an accident but has also been used as a method of torture and execution.  In such practices, disembowelment may be accompanied by other forms of torture, or the removal of other vital organs.","image":"Gutting_fish_in_Isla_Margarita.JPG.webp","url":"Disembowelment"}
