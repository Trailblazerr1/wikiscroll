{"title":"Matthew 25","summary":"Matthew 25, the twenty-fifth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, continues the Olivet Discourse or \"Little Apocalypse\" spoken by Jesus Christ, also described as the Eschatological Discourse,[1] which had started in chapter 24.[2] It includes the parable of the ten virgins (verses 1-13) and the parable of the talents or minas (verses 14-30), both unique to Matthew,[3] followed by notice of \"the great and universal judgment at the end of this period\",[3] with its parabolic references to a separation of peoples \"as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats\" (verse 32). The final section (verses 31-46) is sometimes referred to as the \"parable of the sheep and the goats\".[4]","image":"P45_Matthieu_25.41-46.jpg.webp"}
