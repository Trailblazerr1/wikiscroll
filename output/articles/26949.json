{"title":"List of papal conclaves","summary":"There have been 110 papal elections that have produced popes currently recognized by the Catholic Church as legitimate. There was no fixed process for papal succession before 1059 and popes were often selected with substantial secular involvement, if not outright appointment. Since the promulgation of In nomine Domini (1059), however, suffrage has been limited to the College of Cardinals.[1]","image":"Roma-sanpietroin_vincoli01.jpg.webp"}
