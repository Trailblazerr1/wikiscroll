These are Catholic churches in the city, under the Diocese of Rome, that serve as honorary designations signifying the relationship between cardinals and the pope, the bishop of Rome.[1] According to the Code of Canon Law, a cardinal may assist his titular church through counsel or through patronage, although \"he has no power of governance over it, and he should not for any reason interfere in matters concerning the administration of its good, or its discipline, or the service of the church\".[2]","image":"Sant_Andrea_della_Valle_Roma_adjusted.JPG.webp","url":"List_of_titular_churches"}
