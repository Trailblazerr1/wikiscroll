{"title":"Zenobia","summary":"Septimia Zenobia (Palmyrene: 𐡡𐡶𐡦𐡡𐡩 () Btzby/Bat-Zabbai; c. 240 – c. 274 AD) was a third-century queen of the Palmyrene Empire in Syria. Many legends surround her ancestry; she was probably not a commoner and she married the ruler of the city, Odaenathus. Her husband became king in 260, elevating Palmyra to supreme power in the Near East by defeating the Sassanians and stabilizing the Roman East. After Odaenathus' assassination, Zenobia became the regent of her son Vaballathus and held de facto power throughout his reign.","image":"Btzby.png.webp"}
