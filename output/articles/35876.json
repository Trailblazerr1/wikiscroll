{"title":"Presidency of Ronald Reagan","summary":"Ronald Reagan's tenure as the 40th president of the United States lasted from his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, until January 20, 1989. Reagan, a Republican from California, took office following a landslide victory over Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election. Four years later, in the 1984 election, he defeated Democrat Walter Mondale to win re-election in a larger landslide. Reagan was succeeded by his vice president, George H. W. Bush, who won the 1988 presidential election with Reagan's support. Reagan's 1980 election resulted from a dramatic conservative shift to the right in American politics, including a loss of confidence in liberal, New Deal, and Great Society programs and priorities that had dominated the national agenda since the 1930s.","image":"Official_Portrait_of_President_Reagan_1981-cropped.jpg.webp"}
