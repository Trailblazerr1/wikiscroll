{"title":"Lyric poetry","summary":"Modern lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person.[1]\nIt is not equivalent to song lyrics, though song lyrics are often in the lyric mode, and it is also not equivalent to  Ancient Greek lyric poetry, which was principally limited song lyrics, or chanted verse, hence the confusion.\nThe term for both modern lyric poetry and modern song lyrics both derive from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the Greek lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a kithara[lower-alpha 1].[2] \nThe term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: Lyrical, dramatic, and epic. Lyric Poetry is also one of the earliest forms of literature.","image":"Liji2_no_bg.png.webp"}
