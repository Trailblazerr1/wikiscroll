{"title":"Týr","summary":"Týr (/tɪər/;[1] Old Norse: Týr, pronounced [tyːz̠]) is a god in Germanic mythology, a valorous and powerful member of the Æsir and patron of warriors and mythological heroes. In Norse mythology, which provides most of the surviving narratives about gods among the Germanic peoples, Týr sacrifices his hand to the monstrous wolf Fenrir, who bites it off when he realizes the gods have bound him. Týr is foretold of being consumed by the similarly monstrous dog Garmr during the events of Ragnarök.","image":"Týr_by_Frølich.jpg.webp","url":"Týr"}
