{"title":"Area 51","summary":"Area 51 is the common name of a highly classified United States Air Force (USAF) facility located within the Nevada Test and Training Range. A remote detachment administered by Edwards Air Force Base, the facility is officially called Homey Airport (XTA/KXTA) or Groom Lake[2] (after the salt flat situated next to its airfield). Details of the facility's operations are not made public, but the USAF says that it is an open training range,[3] and it is commonly thought to support the development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems.[4][3] The USAF acquired the site in 1955, primarily for flight testing the Lockheed U-2 aircraft.[5]","image":"Wfm_area_51_landsat_geocover_2000.jpg.webp","url":"Area_51"}
