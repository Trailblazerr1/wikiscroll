{"title":"Fiberglass","summary":"Fiberglass (American English), or fibreglass (Commonwealth English),  is a common type of fiber-reinforced plastic using glass fiber. The fibers may be randomly arranged, flattened into a sheet (called a chopped strand mat), or woven into glass cloth. The plastic matrix may be a thermoset polymer matrix—most often based on thermosetting polymers such as epoxy, polyester resin,  or vinyl ester resin—or a thermoplastic.","image":"Glass_reinforcements.jpg.webp"}
