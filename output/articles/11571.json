{"title":"Crown group","summary":"In phylogenetics, the crown group or crown assemblage is a collection of species, composed of the living representatives of the collection, the most recent common ancestor of the collection, and all descendants of the most recent common ancestor. It is thus a way of defining a clade, a group consisting of a species and all its extant or extinct descendants. For example, Neornithes (birds) can be defined as a crown group, which includes the most recent common ancestor of all modern birds, and all of its extant or extinct descendants.","image":"Stemgroups_Rev.svg.png.webp"}
