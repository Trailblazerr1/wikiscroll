{"title":"Calcitriol","summary":"Calcitriol is the active form of vitamin D, normally made in the kidney.[8][9] It is also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. It is a hormone which binds to and activates the vitamin D receptor in the nucleus of the cell, which then increases the expression of many genes.[10]  Calcitriol increases blood calcium (Ca2+) mainly by increasing the uptake of calcium from the intestines.[7]","image":"Calcitriol.svg.png.webp"}
