{"title":"Mountain","summary":"A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.[1]","image":"Everest_North_Face_toward_Base_Camp_Tibet_Luca_Galuzzi_2006.jpg.webp","url":"Mountain"}
