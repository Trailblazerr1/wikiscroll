{"title":"Classical music","summary":"Classical music most commonly refers to the formal musical tradition of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western folk music or popular music traditions.[1][n 1] It is often distinguished as Western classical music,[n 2] as the term 'classical music' alone may also refer to music evidencing similar formal qualities in non-Western cultures. The tradition originated in Western Europe with the music of the early Christian Church, having roots to some extent in the music of ancient Greece and Rome. Modern musicologists often classify it into major eras: the Medieval (500–1400), Renaissance (1400–1600), Baroque (1600–1750), Classical (1750–1820), Romantic (1800–1910), Modernist (1890–1975) and Postmodern/Contemporary (1950–present) eras. These periods and their dates are all approximate generalizations and represent gradual stylistic shifts that varied in intensity and prominence throughout the Western world.","image":"Altes_AKH_Vienna_June_2006_583_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Classical_music"}
