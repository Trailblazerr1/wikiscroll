{"title":"Millennium Dome","summary":"The Millennium Dome was the original name of the large dome-shaped building on the Greenwich Peninsula in South East London, England, which housed a major exhibition celebrating the beginning of the third millennium. It is the eighth largest building in the world by usable volume. The exhibition was open to the public from 1 January to 31 December 2000. The project and exhibition were highly political and attracted barely half the 12 million customers its sponsors forecast, and so were deemed a failure by the press.[2] All the original exhibition elements were sold or dismantled.","image":"Millennium_Dome_1.jpg.webp"}
