{"title":"Battle of Old Trafford","summary":"The \"Battle of Old Trafford\" was a Premier League match played on Sunday, 21 September 2003 between Manchester United and Arsenal. The name was later applied to the same fixture during the following season. The final result, a 0–0 draw, turned out to be significant for Arsenal as they went on to finish the league season without a single defeat, something that had only been achieved once before in English football, by Preston North End in 1888–89.","image":"Old_Trafford.jpg.webp","url":"Battle_of_Old_Trafford"}
