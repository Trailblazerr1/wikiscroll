{"title":"Ultraviolence (album)","summary":"Ultraviolence is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey, released on June 13, 2014, by UMG Recordings. Despite originally dismissing the possibility of releasing another record after her major-label debut Born to Die (2012), Del Rey began planning its follow-up in 2013. Production continued into 2014, at which time she heavily collaborated with Dan Auerbach to revamp what she initially considered to be the completed record. The project saw additional contributions from producers including Paul Epworth, Greg Kurstin, Daniel Heath, and Rick Nowels, and features a more guitar-based sound than Del Rey's previous releases.[lower-alpha 1]","image":"UltraviolenceLDR.png.webp","url":"Ultraviolence_(album)"}
