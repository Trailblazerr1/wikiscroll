{"title":"Cladistics","summary":"Cladistics (/kləˈdɪstɪks/; from Ancient Greek  κλάδος (kládos) 'branch')[1] is an approach to biological classification in which organisms are categorized in groups (\"clades\") based on hypotheses of most recent common ancestry. The evidence for hypothesized relationships is typically shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies) that are not present in more distant groups and ancestors.  Theoretically, a common ancestor and all its descendants are part of the clade. However, from an empirical perspective, common ancestors are inferences based on a cladistic hypothesis of relationships of taxa whose character states can be observed. Importantly, all descendants stay in their overarching ancestral clade. For example, if the terms worms or fishes were used within a strict cladistic framework, these terms would include humans. Many of these terms are normally used paraphyletically, outside of cladistics, e.g. as a 'grade'. Radiation results in the generation of new subclades by bifurcation, but in practice sexual hybridization may blur very closely related groupings.[2][3][4][5]","image":"Darwin's_finches_by_Gould.jpg.webp"}
