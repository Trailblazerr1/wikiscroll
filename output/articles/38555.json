{"title":"Rotating locomotion in living systems","summary":"Several organisms are capable of rolling locomotion. However, true wheels and propellers—despite their utility in human vehicles—do not seem to play a significant role in the movement of living things (with the exception of certain flagella, which work like corkscrews). Biologists have offered several explanations for the apparent absence of biological wheels, and wheeled creatures have appeared often in speculative fiction.","image":"Wheeled_animal_-_East_Mexico_cultures_-_Ethnological_Museum%2C_Berlin_-_DSC00852.JPG.webp","url":"Rotating_locomotion_in_living_systems"}
