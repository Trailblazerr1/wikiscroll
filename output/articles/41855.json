{"title":"Square root","summary":"In mathematics, a square root of a number x is a number y such that y2 = x; in other words, a number y whose square (the result of multiplying the number by itself, or y ⋅ y) is x.[1] For example, 4 and −4 are square roots of 16, because 42 = (−4)2 = 16.\nEvery nonnegative real number x has a unique nonnegative square root, called the principal square root, which is denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {x}},}\n  \n where the symbol \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n               \n              \n                 \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {~^{~}}}}\n  \n is called the radical sign[2] or radix. For example, the principal square root of 9 is 3, which is denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            9\n          \n        \n        =\n        3\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {9}}=3,}\n  \n because 32 = 3 ⋅ 3 = 9 and 3 is nonnegative.  The term (or number) whose square root is being considered is known as the radicand. The radicand is the number or expression underneath the radical sign, in this case 9.","image":"b9763d9ff8638b882608213f6dc8e9fc8ddc79d3.svg"}
