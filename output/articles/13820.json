{"title":"Dvaita Vedanta","summary":"Dvaita Vedanta (originally known as Tattvavāda) (/ˈdvaɪtə vɪˈdɑːntə/), is a sub-school in the Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophy. Alternatively known as Bhedavāda,  Bimbapratibimbavāda, Pūrnabrahmavāda and Svatantra-Advitiya-Brahmavāda, the Dvaita Vedanta sub-school was founded by the 13th-century scholar Madhvacharya.[1] The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that God and the individual souls (jīvātman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct, being said that Vishnu (Narayana) is independent, and souls are dependent on him. The Dvaita school contrasts with the other two major sub-schools of Vedanta, the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara which posits nondualism – that ultimate reality (Brahman) and human soul (Ātman) are identical and all reality is interconnected oneness, and Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja which posits qualified nondualism – that ultimate reality (Brahman) and human soul are different but with the potential to be identical.[2][3]","image":"Om_symbol.svg.png.webp","url":"Dvaita_Vedanta"}
