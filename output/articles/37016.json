{"title":"Rainband","summary":"A rainband is a cloud and precipitation structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated.  Rainbands can be stratiform or convective,[1] and are generated by differences in temperature.  When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure.[2]  Rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation. Rainbands of tropical cyclones contain showers and thunderstorms that, together with the eyewall and the eye, constitute a hurricane or tropical storm.  The extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclone's intensity.","image":"Sturmfront_auf_Doppler-Radar-Schirm.jpg.webp","url":"Rainband"}
