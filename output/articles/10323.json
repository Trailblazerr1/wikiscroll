{"title":"Clostridioides difficile infection","summary":"Clostridioides difficile infection [5]  (CDI or C-diff), also known as Clostridium difficile infection, is a symptomatic infection due to the spore-forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile.[2][6] Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain.[1] It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.[1]  Antibiotics can contribute to detrimental changes in gut microbiota; specifically, they decrease short-chain fatty acid absorption which results in osmotic, or watery, diarrhea.[7] Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, and sepsis.[1]","image":"Pseudomembranous_colitis.JPG.webp","url":"Clostridioides_difficile_infection"}
