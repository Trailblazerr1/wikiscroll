{"title":"Russian Empire","summary":"The Russian Empire,[lower-alpha 5] commonly referred to as Imperial Russia, was a historical empire that extended across Eurasia from 1721, succeeding the Tsardom of Russia following the Treaty of Nystad that ended the Great Northern War. The Empire lasted until the Republic was proclaimed by the Provisional Government that took power after the February Revolution of 1917.[3][4] The third-largest empire in history, at one point stretching over three continents—Europe, Asia, and North America—the Russian Empire was surpassed in size only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire coincided with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Qing China.","image":"Flag_of_Russia.svg.png.webp","url":"Russian_Empire"}
