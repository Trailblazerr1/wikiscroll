{"title":"List of songs recorded by the Beatles","summary":"The Beatles were an English rock band from Liverpool who recorded hundreds of songs during their career. The group's \"main catalogue\"—songs released between 1962 and 1970—consists of 213 songs (four of which exist in different versions): 188 originals and 25 covers. Since their break-up, over 100 more songs by the group have been officially released, which include live songs the group never recorded in the studio and numerous outtakes. The band also recorded several songs that remain unreleased. Often considered the most influential band of the rock era,[1] the group's music pioneered new recording techniques and was primarily responsible for pop music's evolution into an art form.[2] The majority of their recordings were produced by George Martin, who also played and composed string arrangements on multiple songs; his influence on the group led him to be referred to as the \"Fifth Beatle\".[3] Between 1962 and 1968, the Beatles released their songs in both mono and stereo versions;[4][5] Abbey Road and Let It Be were mixed and released only in stereo.[6] Their songs often featured differences between the mixes and the group put the most effort into making the mono mixes.[5] All mono mixes were remastered and released on The Beatles in Mono box set in 2009,[6] along with the remastering of the band's entire catalogue in stereo.[7]","image":"Beatles_ad_1965_just_the_beatles_crop.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_songs_recorded_by_the_Beatles"}
