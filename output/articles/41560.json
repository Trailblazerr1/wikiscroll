{"title":"SpaceX Merlin","summary":"Merlin is a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX for use on its Falcon 1, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles. Merlin engines use RP-1 and liquid oxygen as rocket propellants in a gas-generator power cycle. The Merlin engine was originally designed for sea recovery and reuse, but since 2016 the entire Falcon 9 booster is recovered for reuse by landing vertically on a landing pad using one of its nine Merlin engines.","image":"SpaceX_Testing_Merlin_1D_Engine_In_Texas.jpg.webp","url":"SpaceX_Merlin"}
