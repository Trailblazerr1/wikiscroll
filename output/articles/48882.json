{"title":"Worcestershire sauce","summary":"Worcestershire sauce (/ˈwʊstərʃər/ WUUS-tər-shər) is a fermented liquid condiment created in the city of Worcester in Worcestershire, England, during the first half of the 19th century. The creators were pharmacists (chemists in British English) John Wheeley Lea and William Henry Perrins, who went on to form the company Lea & Perrins. Worcestershire sauce has been considered a generic term since 1876, when the English High Court of Justice ruled that Lea & Perrins did not own a trademark for the name Worcestershire.[1]","image":"Worcester_Sauce_001.jpg.webp","url":"Worcestershire_sauce"}
