{"title":"Mordred","summary":"Mordred or Modred (/ˈmoʊdrɛd/; Welsh: Medraut or Medrawt) is a figure who is variously portrayed in the British tradition. The earliest known mention of a possibly historical Medraut is in the Welsh chronicle Annales Cambriae, wherein he and Arthur are ambiguously associated with the Battle of Camlann in a brief entry for the year 537. His figure seemed to have been regarded positively in the early Welsh tradition and may have been related to that of Arthur's son.","image":"Sir_Mordred_by_H._J._Ford.png.webp","url":"Mordred"}
