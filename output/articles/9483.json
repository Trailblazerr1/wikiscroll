{"title":"Chemotroph","summary":"Chemotrophs are organisms that obtain energy by the oxidation of electron donors in their environments.[1] These molecules can be organic (chemoorganotrophs) or inorganic (chemolithotrophs).  The chemotroph designation is in contrast to phototrophs, which use solar energy. Chemotrophs can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic. Chemotrophs can be found on ocean floors where sunlight cannot reach. Or above ground, such as the case with iron bacteria.","image":"Blacksmoker_in_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg.webp","url":"Chemotroph"}
