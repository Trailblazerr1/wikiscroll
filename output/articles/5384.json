{"title":"Baker Street and Waterloo Railway","summary":"The Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&WR), also known as the Bakerloo tube, was a railway company established in 1893 that built a deep-level underground \"tube\" railway in London.[lower-alpha 1] The company struggled to fund the work, and construction did not begin until 1898. In 1900, work was hit by the financial collapse of its parent company, the London & Globe Finance Corporation, through the fraud of Whitaker Wright, its main shareholder. In 1902, the BS&WR became a subsidiary of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) controlled by American financier Charles Yerkes. The UERL quickly raised the funds, mainly from foreign investors.","image":"Baker_Street_%26_Waterloo_Railway.png.webp","url":"Baker_Street_and_Waterloo_Railway"}
