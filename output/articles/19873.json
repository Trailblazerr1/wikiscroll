{"title":"Heart valve","summary":"A heart valve is a one-way valve that allows blood to flow in one direction through the chambers of the heart. Four valves are  usually present in a mammalian heart and together they determine the pathway of blood flow through the heart. A heart valve opens or closes according to differential blood pressure on each side.[1][2][3]","image":"CG_Heart.gif"}
