{"title":"Thoracic diaphragm","summary":"The thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm (Ancient Greek: διάφραγμα, romanized: diáphragma, lit. 'partition'), is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle[2] in humans and other mammals that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is the most important muscle of respiration,[3] and separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating a negative pressure there, which draws air into the lungs.[4] Its high oxygen consumption is noted by the many mitochondria and capillaries present; more than in any other skeletal muscle.[3]","image":"Respiratory_system.svg.png.webp"}
