{"title":"Dutch East India Company","summary":"The Dutch East India Company, officially the United East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie[lower-alpha 6]; VOC), was a multinational corporation founded by a government-directed consolidation of several rival Dutch trading companies (voorcompagnieÃ«n) in the early 17th century. It is believed to be the largest company to ever have existed in recorded history.[9][10] It was established on March 20, 1602, as a chartered company to trade with Mughal India[11] in the early modern period, from which 50% of textiles and 80% of silks were imported, chiefly from its most developed region known as Bengal Subah.[12][13][14][15][16] In addition, the company traded with Indianised Southeast Asian countries when the Dutch government granted it a 21-year monopoly on the Dutch spice trade.","image":"VOC.svg.png.webp"}
