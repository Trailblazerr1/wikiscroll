{"title":"Selective estrogen receptor modulator","summary":"Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), also known as estrogen receptor agonist/antagonists (ERAAs),[1][2] are a class of drugs that act on the estrogen receptor (ER).[3] A characteristic that distinguishes these substances from pure ER agonists and antagonists (that is, full agonists and silent antagonists) is that their action is different in various tissues, thereby granting the possibility to selectively inhibit or stimulate estrogen-like action in various tissues.","image":"Tamoxifen2DACS.svg.png.webp"}
