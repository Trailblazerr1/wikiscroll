{"title":"Achilles tendon","summary":"The Achilles tendon or heel cord, also known as the calcaneal tendon, is a tendon at the back of the lower leg, and is the thickest in the human body.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] It serves to attach the plantaris, gastrocnemius (calf) and soleus muscles to the calcaneus (heel) bone. These muscles, acting via the tendon, cause plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle joint, and (except the soleus) flexion at the knee.","image":"1123_Muscles_of_the_Leg_that_Move_the_Foot_and_Toes_b.png.webp","url":"Achilles_tendon"}
