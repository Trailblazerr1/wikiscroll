{"title":"Otto of Greece","summary":"Otto (Greek: Όθων, romanized: Óthon,  German: Otto Friedrich Ludwig von Bayern; 1 June 1815 – 26 July 1867) was a Bavarian prince who ruled as King of Greece from the establishment of the monarchy on 27 May 1832, under the Convention of London, until he was deposed on 23 October 1862. The Convention controversially forced a European monarch on the ethnolinguistically diverse and historically Middle Eastern-oriented Levantine country, and therefore Otto was never widely beloved in his adopted homeland.","image":"Prinz_Otto_von_Bayern_Koenig_von_Griechenland_1833.jpg.webp","url":"Otto_of_Greece"}
