{"title":"Statistical dispersion","summary":"In statistics, dispersion (also called variability, scatter, or spread) is the extent to which a distribution is stretched or squeezed.[1] Common examples of measures of statistical dispersion are the variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range. For instance, when the variance of data in a set is large, the data is widely scattered. On the other hand, when the variance is small, the data in the set is clustered.","image":"Comparison_standard_deviations.svg.png.webp","url":"Statistical_dispersion"}
