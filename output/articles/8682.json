{"title":"Carmina Burana","summary":"Carmina Burana (/ˈkɑːrmɪnə bʊˈrɑːnə/, Latin for \"Songs from Benediktbeuern\" [Buria in Latin]) is a manuscript of 254[1] poems and dramatic texts mostly from the 11th or 12th century, although some are from the 13th century. The pieces are mostly bawdy, irreverent, and satirical. They were written principally in Medieval Latin, a few in Middle High German and old Arpitan. Some are macaronic, a mixture of Latin and German or French vernacular.","image":"CarminaBurana_wheel.jpg.webp"}
