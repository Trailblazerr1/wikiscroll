{"title":"Olympic Stadium (Montreal)","summary":"Olympic Stadium[1] (French: Stade olympique) is a multi-purpose stadium in Montreal, Canada, located at Olympic Park in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district of the city. Built in the mid-1970s as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics, it is nicknamed \"The Big O\", a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof. It is also disparagingly referred to as \"The Big Owe\" in reference the astronomical construction costs to the city and of the hosting of the 1976 Olympics as a whole.[6] The tower standing next to the stadium, The Montreal Tower, is the tallest inclined tower in the world with an angle elevation of 45 degrees.","image":"Le_Stade_Olympique_3.jpg.webp"}
