{"title":"Seborrhoeic dermatitis","summary":"Seborrhoeic dermatitis, sometimes inaccurately referred to as seborrhoea, is a long-term skin disorder.[4] Symptoms include red, scaly, greasy, itchy, and inflamed skin.[2][3] Areas of the skin rich in oil-producing glands are often affected including the scalp, face, and chest.[4] It can result in social or self-esteem problems.[4] In babies, when the scalp is primarily involved, it is called cradle cap.[2] Dandruff is a milder form of the condition without inflammation.[6]","image":"Seborrhoeic_dermatitis_highres.jpg.webp","url":"Seborrhoeic_dermatitis"}
