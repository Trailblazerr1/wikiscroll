{"title":"Parti Québécois","summary":"The Parti Québécois (pronounced [paʁti kebekwa]; French for '\"Quebec Party\"'; PQ) is a sovereignist[9] and social democratic[1] provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. The PQ advocates national sovereignty for Quebec involving independence of the province of Quebec from Canada and establishing a sovereign state. The PQ has also promoted the possibility of maintaining a loose political and economic sovereignty-association between Quebec and Canada. The party traditionally has support from the labour movement, but unlike most other social democratic parties, its ties with organized labour are informal.[10] Members and supporters of the PQ are nicknamed péquistes (Quebec French pronunciation: [pekɪst] (listen)[11]), a French word derived from the pronunciation of the party's initials in Quebec French.","image":"Parti_Québécois_logo_vector.svg.png.webp","url":"Parti_Québécois"}
