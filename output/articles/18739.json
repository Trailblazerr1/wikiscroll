{"title":"Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer","summary":"The Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) was the first of ESA's Living Planet Programme satellites intended to map in unprecedented detail the Earth's gravity field. The spacecraft's primary instrumentation was a highly sensitive gravity gradiometer consisting of three pairs of accelerometers which measured gravitational gradients along three orthogonal axes.","image":"GOCE.jpg.webp","url":"Gravity_Field_and_Steady-State_Ocean_Circulation_Explorer"}
