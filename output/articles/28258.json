{"title":"Mandelbrot set","summary":"The Mandelbrot set (/ˈmændəlbrɒt/) is the set of complex numbers c {\\displaystyle c} for which the function f c ( z ) = z 2 + c {\\displaystyle f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c} does not diverge to infinity when iterated from z = 0 {\\displaystyle z=0} , i.e., for which the sequence f c ( 0 ) {\\displaystyle f_{c}(0)} , f c ( f c ( 0 ) ) {\\displaystyle f_{c}(f_{c}(0))} , etc., remains bounded in absolute value. Its definition is credited to Adrien Douady who named it in tribute to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, a pioneer of fractal geometry.[1]","image":"86a67b81c2de995bd608d5b2df50cd8cd7d92455.svg","url":"Mandelbrot_set"}
