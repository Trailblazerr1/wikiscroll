{"title":"Border","summary":"Borders are geographic boundaries, imposed either by geographic features such as oceans, or by arbitrary groupings of political entities such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Borders are established through warfare, colonization, or simple symbiotic agreements between the political entities that reside in those areas; the creation of these agreements is called boundary delimitation.","image":"City_Lights_at_Night_along_the_France-Italy_Border.JPG.webp","url":"Border"}
