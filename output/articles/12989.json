{"title":"Digital journalism","summary":"Digital journalism, also known as online journalism, is a contemporary form of journalism where editorial content is distributed via the Internet, as opposed to publishing via print or broadcast. What constitutes digital journalism is debated by scholars; however, the primary product of journalism, which is news and features on current affairs, is presented solely or in combination as text, audio, video, or some interactive forms like newsgames, and disseminated through digital media technology.[1][2]","image":"Newspaper_nicu_buculei_01.svg.png.webp","url":"Digital_journalism"}
