{"title":"Evil","summary":"Evil, in a general sense, is defined by what it is notâ€”the opposite or absence of good. It can be an extremely broad concept, although in everyday usage it is often more narrowly used to talk about profound wickedness. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal moral evil commonly associated with the word, or impersonal natural evil (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal.[1] While some religions, world views, and philosophies focus on \"good versus evil\", others deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.","image":"Extermination_of_Evil_Sendan_Kendatsuba_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Evil"}
