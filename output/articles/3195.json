{"title":"Ambush predator","summary":"Ambush predators or sit-and-wait predators are carnivorous animals that capture or trap prey by stealth, luring or by (typically instinctive) strategies utilizing an element of surprise.  Unlike pursuit predators, who chase to capture prey using sheer speed or endurance, ambush predators avoid fatigue by staying in concealment, waiting patiently for the prey to get near, before launching a sudden overwhelming attack that quickly incapacitates and captures the prey.","image":"Spider_and_fly_April_2008-6.jpg.webp"}
