{"title":"House of Lords Act 1999","summary":"The House of Lords Act 1999 (c. 34) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that was given Royal Assent on 11 November 1999.[3] The Act reformed the House of Lords, one of the chambers of Parliament. For centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats (hereditary peers); the Act removed such a right. However, as part of a compromise, the Act did permit ninety-two hereditary peers to remain in the House on an interim basis. Another ten were created life peers to enable them to remain in the House.[5]","image":"Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(HM_Government).svg.png.webp","url":"House_of_Lords_Act_1999"}
