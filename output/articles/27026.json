{"title":"List of tallest buildings in Las Vegas","summary":"The city of Las Vegas, Nevada and its surrounding unincorporated communities in the Las Vegas Valley are the sites of more than 160 high-rises,[1] 42 of which stand taller than 400 feet (122 m). The tallest structure in the city is the Strat tower, which rises 1,149 feet (350 m) just north of the Las Vegas Strip.[2] The tower is also the tallest observation tower in the United States.[3] Since the Strat tower is not fully habitable, however, it is not considered a building. The tallest building in Las Vegas is the Fontainebleau Las Vegas, which rises 735 feet (224 m) and was topped out in November 2008. This building, however, remained unfinished for several years due to the late-2000s recession.[4] The tallest completed building in the city is the 53-story Palazzo, which rises 642 feet (196 m) and was completed in 2007.[5]","image":"Stratosphere_Las_Vegas_-_November_2003.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_tallest_buildings_in_Las_Vegas"}
