{"title":"Judgment of Paris (wine)","summary":"The Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, also known as the Judgment of Paris, was a wine competition organized in Paris on 24 May 1976 by Steven Spurrier, a British wine merchant and his colleague, Patricia Gallagher, in which French judges carried out two blind tasting comparisons: one of top-quality Chardonnays and another of red wines (Bordeaux wines from France and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from California).[1][2]  A Californian wine rated best in each category, which caused surprise as France was generally regarded as being the foremost producer of the world's best wines.  Spurrier sold only French wine and believed that the California wines would not win.[3]","image":"Vineyard_on_Monte_Bello_Ridge_Cabernet_Sauvignon.jpg.webp"}
