{"title":"Polish alphabet","summary":"The Polish alphabet also abecadło is the script of the Polish language, the basis for the Polish system of orthography. It is based on the Latin alphabet but includes certain letters with diacritics: the kreska or acute accent (ć, ń, ó, ś, ź); the overdot or kropka (ż); the tail or ogonek (ą, ę); and the stroke (ł). The letters q, v and x, which are used only in foreign words, are usually absent from the Polish alphabet. However, prior to the standardization of the Polish language, the letter \"x\" was sometimes used in place of \"ks\".[1]","image":"Polish-alphabet.png.webp"}
