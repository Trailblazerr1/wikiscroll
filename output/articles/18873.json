{"title":"Greco-Roman world","summary":"The term \"Greco-Roman world\" (also \"Greco-Roman culture\" /ˌɡrikoʊˈroʊmən/ or /ˌɡrɛkoʊˈroʊmən/; spelled Graeco-Roman in the  Commonwealth), as understood by modern scholars and writers, refers to geographical regions and countries that culturally—and so historically—were directly and intimately influenced by the language, culture, government and religion of the ancient Greeks and  Romans. A better-known term is classical civilization. In exact terms the area refers to the  \"Mediterranean world\", the extensive tracts of land centered on the  Mediterranean and Black Sea Basins, the \"swimming pool and spa\" of the Greeks and the Romans, in which those peoples' cultural perceptions, ideas, and sensitivities became dominant in classical antiquity.","image":"L'Olympieion_(Athènes)_(30776483926).jpg.webp"}
