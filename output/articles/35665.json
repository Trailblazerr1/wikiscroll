{"title":"Post-punk","summary":"Post-punk (originally called new musick)[1] is a broad genre of rock music that emerged in the late 1970s as musicians departed from the raw simplicity and traditionalism of punk rock, instead adopting a variety of avant-garde sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by punk's energy and DIY ethic but determined to break from rock cliches, artists experimented with styles like funk, electronic music, jazz, and dance music; the production techniques of dub and disco; and ideas from art and politics, including critical theory, modernist art, cinema and literature.[2][3] These communities produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines.","image":"Siouxsie_and_the_banshees_1979_with_robert_smith.jpg.webp","url":"Post-punk"}
