{"title":"Diplodocus","summary":"Diplodocus (/dɪˈplɒdəkəs/,[3][4] /daɪˈplɒdəkəs/,[4] or /ˌdɪploʊˈdoʊkəs/[3]) is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaurs, whose fossils were first discovered in 1877 by S. W. Williston. The generic name, coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878, is a neo-Latin term derived from Greek διπλός (diplos) \"double\" and δοκός (dokos) \"beam\",[3][5] in reference to the double-beamed chevron bones located in the underside of the tail, which were then considered unique.","image":"CM_Diplodocus.jpg.webp","url":"Diplodocus"}
