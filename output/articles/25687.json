{"title":"Lawsuit","summary":"A lawsuit is a proceeding by a party or parties against another in the civil court of law.[1] The archaic term \"suit in law\" is found in only a small number of laws still in effect today. The term \"lawsuit\" is used in reference to a civil action brought by a plaintiff (a party who claims to have incurred loss as a result of a defendant's actions) demands a legal or equitable remedy from a court. The defendant is required to respond to the plaintiff's complaint. If the plaintiff is successful, judgment is in the plaintiff's favor, and a variety of court orders may be issued to enforce a right, award damages, or impose a temporary or permanent injunction to prevent an act or compel an act. A declaratory judgment may be issued to prevent future legal disputes.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
