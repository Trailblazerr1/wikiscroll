{"title":"My All","summary":"\"My All\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album, Butterfly (1997). It was released as the album's fifth single overall and second commercial single on April 21, 1998, by Columbia Records. The song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. \"My All\" is built around Latin guitar chord melodies, and makes subtle use of Latin percussion throughout the first chorus, before taking on a more conventional R&B-style beat. Carey was inspired to write the song and use Latin inspired melodies after her trip to Puerto Rico, where she was influenced by the culture. The song's lyrics tell of a lonely woman declaring she would give \"her all\" to have just one more night with her estranged lover. It is the first song Carey wrote for the Butterfly album.[1]","image":"My_All_and_Breakdown_by_Mariah_Carey_US_artwork.png.webp"}
