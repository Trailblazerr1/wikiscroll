{"title":"Initial public offering","summary":"An initial public offering (IPO) or stock launch is a public offering in which shares of a company are sold to institutional investors[1] and usually also retail (individual) investors.[2] An IPO is typically underwritten by one or more investment banks, who also arrange for the shares to be listed on one or more stock exchanges. Through this process, colloquially known as floating, or going public, a privately held company is transformed into a public company. Initial public offerings can be used to raise new equity capital for companies, to monetize the investments of private shareholders such as company founders or private equity investors, and to enable easy trading of existing holdings or future capital raising by becoming publicly traded.","image":"Emanuel_de_Witte_-_De_binnenplaats_van_de_beurs_te_Amsterdam.jpg.webp","url":"Initial_public_offering"}
