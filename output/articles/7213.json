{"title":"Book of Numbers","summary":"The Book of Numbers (from Greek Ἀριθμοί, Arithmoi; Hebrew: בְּמִדְבַּר‎, Bəmiḏbar, \"In the desert [of]\"), also known as the Fourth Book of Moses,[1] is the fourth book of the Hebrew Bible, and the fourth of five books of the Jewish Torah.[2] The book has a long and complex history; its final form is possibly due to a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a Yahwistic source made some time in the early Persian period (5th century BCE).[3]  The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites.","image":"Aleppo_Codex_Joshua_1_1.jpg.webp"}
