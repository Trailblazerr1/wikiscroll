{"title":"Tautomer","summary":"Tautomers (/ˈtɔːtəmər/)[1] are structural isomers (constitutional isomers) of chemical compounds that readily interconvert.[2][3][4][5]  This reaction commonly results in the relocation of a hydrogen atom. Tautomerism is for example relevant to the behavior of amino acids and nucleic acids, two of the fundamental building blocks of life.","image":"Amino_acid_zwitterions.svg.png.webp"}
