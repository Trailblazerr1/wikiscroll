{"title":"Dory","summary":"A dory is a small, shallow-draft boat, about 5 to 7 metres or 16 to 23 feet long. It is usually a lightweight boat with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows. They are easy to build because of their simple lines. For centuries, dories have been used as traditional fishing boats, both in coastal waters and in the open sea.","image":"Stack_of_Dories_Lunenburg.jpg.webp","url":"Dory"}
