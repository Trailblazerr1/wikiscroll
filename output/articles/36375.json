{"title":"Prune","summary":"A prune is a dried plum, most commonly from the European plum (Prunus domestica). Not all plum species or varieties can be dried into prunes.[1] A prune is the firm-fleshed fruit (plum) of Prunus domestica varieties that have a high soluble solids content, and does not ferment during drying.[2] Use of the term \"prune\" for fresh plums is obsolete except when applied to varieties of plum grown for drying.[3]","image":"Rosales_-_Dried_Prunus_domestica_d.jpg.webp"}
