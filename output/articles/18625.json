{"title":"Grammatical mood","summary":"In linguistics, grammatical mood is a grammatical feature of verbs, used for signaling modality.[1][2]: p.181,  [3] That is, it is the use of verbal inflections that allow speakers to express their attitude toward what they are saying (for example, a statement of fact, of desire, of command, etc.). The term is also used more broadly to describe the syntactic expression of modality – that is, the use of verb phrases that do not involve inflection of the verb itself.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
