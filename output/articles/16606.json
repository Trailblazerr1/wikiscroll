{"title":"Foot (prosody)","summary":"The foot is the basic repeating rhythmic unit that forms part of a line of verse in most Indo-European traditions of poetry, including English accentual-syllabic verse and the quantitative meter of classical ancient Greek and Latin poetry. The unit is composed of syllables, and is usually two, three, or four syllables in length. The most common feet in English are the iamb, trochee, dactyl, and anapest.[1] The foot might be compared to a bar, or a beat divided into pulse groups, in musical notation.","image":"Long-foot-meter.svg.png.webp"}
