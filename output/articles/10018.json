{"title":"Cigarette","summary":"A cigarette is a narrow cylinder containing burnable material, typically tobacco, that is rolled into thin paper for smoking. The cigarette is ignited at one end, causing it to smolder; the resulting smoke is orally inhaled via the opposite end. Cigarette smoking is the most common method of tobacco consumption. Manufacturers have described the cigarette as \"a drug administration system for the delivery of nicotine in acceptable and attractive form.\"[1][2][3][4] The term cigarette, as commonly used, refers to a tobacco cigarette, but the word is sometimes used to refer to other substances, such as a cannabis (Jazz) cigarette or an herbal cigarette. A cigarette is distinguished from a cigar by its usually smaller size, use of processed leaf, and paper wrapping, which is typically white. A cigarette may be called a fag in British slang.[5] Many other terms are used for cigarettes, including cigs, ciggies, smokes, stogs, boges, and tabs.","image":"Cigarette_DS.jpg.webp","url":"Cigarette"}
