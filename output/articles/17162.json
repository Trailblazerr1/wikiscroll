{"title":"Fula people","summary":"The Fula, Fulani, or FulÉ“e people (Fula: FulÉ“e, ðž¤Šðž¤µðž¤¤ðž¤©ðž¤«â€Ž; French: Peul; Hausa: Fulani or Hilani; Portuguese: Fula; Wolof: PÃ«l; Bambara: Fulaw) are one of the largest ethnic groups in the Sahel and West Africa, widely dispersed across the region.[18] Inhabiting many countries, they live mainly in West Africa and northern parts of Central Africa but also in South Sudan, Darfur, Eritrea, and regions near the Red Sea coast. The approximate number of Fula people is unknown due to clashing definitions regarding Fula ethnicity; various estimates put the figure between 55[19][20] and 69.2 million worldwide.[21]","image":"Garibou_Peul.jpg.webp","url":"Fula_people"}
