{"title":"Glass frog","summary":"The glass frogs are frogs of the amphibian family Centrolenidae (order Anura). While the general background coloration of most glass frogs is primarily lime green, the abdominal skin of some members of this family is transparent and translucent. The internal viscera, including the heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, are visible through the skin, hence the common name is given as glass frog. Glass frogs are arboreal, meaning they mainly live in trees, and only come out for mating season.","image":"Cochranella_susatamai03.jpg.webp","url":"Glass_frog"}
