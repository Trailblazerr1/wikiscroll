{"title":"Closed captioning","summary":"Closed captioning (CC) and subtitling are both processes of displaying text on a television, video screen, or other visual display to provide additional or interpretive information. Both are typically used as a transcription of the audio portion of a program as it occurs (either verbatim or in edited form), sometimes including descriptions of non-speech elements. Other uses have included providing a textual alternative language translation of a presentation's primary audio language that is usually burned-in (or \"open\") to the video and unselectable.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Closed_captioning"}
