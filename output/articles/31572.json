{"title":"Necronomicon","summary":"The Necronomicon, also referred to as the Book of the Dead, or under a purported original Arabic title of Kitab al-Azif, is a fictional grimoire (textbook of magic) appearing in stories by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft and his followers. It was first mentioned in Lovecraft's 1924 short story \"The Hound\",[1] written in 1922, though its purported author, the \"Mad Arab\" Abdul Alhazred, had been quoted a year earlier in Lovecraft's \"The Nameless City\".[2] Among other things, the work contains an account of the Old Ones, their history, and the means for summoning them.","image":"H._P._Lovecraft%2C_June_1934.jpg.webp"}
