{"title":"Radula","summary":"The radula (UK: /ˈrædjʊlə/, US: /ˈrædʒʊlə/; plural radulae or radulas)[1] is an anatomical structure used by mollusks for feeding, sometimes compared to a tongue.[2] It is a minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon, which is typically used for scraping or cutting food before the food enters the esophagus. The radula is unique to the molluscs, and is found in every class of mollusc except the bivalves, which instead use cilia, waving filaments that bring minute organisms to the mouth.","image":"Ghost_Slug_teeth.jpg.webp","url":"Radula"}
