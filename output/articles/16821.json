{"title":"Francis Marrash","summary":"Francis bin Fathallah bin Nasrallah Marrash (Arabic: فرنسيس بن فتح الله بن نصر الله مرّاش, ALA-LC: Fransīs bin Fatḥ Allāh bin Naṣr Allāh Marrāsh; 1835,[1] 1836,[2][lower-alpha 1] or 1837[3][lower-alpha 2] – 1873[5] or 1874[1]), also known as Francis al-Marrash or Francis Marrash al-Halabi, was a Syrian scholar,[6] publicist,[6] writer and poet of the Nahda or the Arab Renaissance, and a physician. Most of his works revolve around science, history and religion, analysed under an epistemological light. He traveled throughout Western Asia and France in his youth, and after some medical training and a year of practice in his native Aleppo, during which he wrote several works, he enrolled in a medical school in Paris; yet, declining health and growing blindness forced him to return to Aleppo, where he produced more literary works until his early death.","image":"Francis_Marrash.jpg.webp"}
