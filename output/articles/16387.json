{"title":"Flag of Mexico","summary":"The flag of Mexico (Spanish: Bandera de MÃ©xico) is a vertical tricolor of  green, white, and red with the national coat of arms charged in the center of the white stripe. While the meaning of the colors has changed over time, these three colors were adopted by Mexico following independence from Spain during the country's War of Independence, and subsequent First Mexican Empire. The form of the coat of arms was most recently revised in 1968, but the overall design has been used since 1821, when the First National Flag was created.","image":"Flag_of_Mexico.svg.png.webp"}
