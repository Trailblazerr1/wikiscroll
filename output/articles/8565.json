{"title":"Carbon tax","summary":"A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon emissions required to produce goods and services. Carbon taxes are intended to make visible the \"hidden\" social costs of carbon emissions, which are otherwise felt only in indirect ways like more severe weather events. In this way, they are designed to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by increasing prices. This both decreases demand for such goods and services and incentivizes efforts to make them less carbon-intensive.[1] In its simplest form, a carbon tax covers only CO2 emissions; however, they can also cover other greenhouse gases, such as methane or nitrous oxide, by calculating their global warming potential relative to CO2.[2] When a hydrocarbon fuel such as coal, petroleum, or natural gas is burnt, much of its carbon is converted to CO2. Greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change, which damages the environment and human health. This negative externality can be reduced by taxing carbon content at any point in the product cycle.[3][4][5][6] Carbon taxes are thus a type of Pigovian tax.[7]","image":"Prim_GRES.jpg.webp"}
