{"title":"Construction and management simulation","summary":"Construction and management simulation (CMS),[1] sometimes also called management sim or building sim, is a subgenre of simulation game in which players build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources.[2] Strategy video games sometimes incorporate CMS aspects into their game economy, as players must manage resources while expanding their project. Pure CMS games differ from strategy games, however, in that \"the player's goal is not to defeat an enemy, but to build something within the context of an ongoing process.\"[1] Games in this category are sometimes also called \"management games\".[3][4][5]","image":"Sim_video_game.svg.png.webp","url":"Construction_and_management_simulation"}
