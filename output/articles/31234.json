{"title":"Nanoparticle","summary":"A nanoparticle or ultrafine particle is usually defined as a particle of matter that is between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in diameter.[1][2] The term is sometimes used for larger particles, up to 500 nm, or fibers and tubes that are less than 100 nm in only two directions.[3]  At the lowest range, metal particles smaller than 1 nm are usually called atom clusters instead.","image":"Mesoporous_Silica_Nanoparticle.jpg.webp"}
