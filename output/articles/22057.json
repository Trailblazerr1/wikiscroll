{"title":"Institution","summary":"Institutions, according to Samuel P. Huntington, are \"stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior.\"[1] Institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community, and are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior.[2] According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior. Instead, Hodgson states that institutions are \"integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions.\"[3]","image":"Social_Network_Diagram_(segment).svg.png.webp"}
