{"title":"History of Guatemala","summary":"The history of Guatemala begins with the Maya civilization (300 BC – 250 AD), which was among those that flourished in their country. The country's modern history began with the Spanish conquest of Guatemala in 1524. Most of the great Classic-era (250 – 900 AD) Maya cities of the Petén Basin region, in the northern lowlands, had been abandoned by the year 1000 AD. The states in the Belize central highlands flourished until the 1525 arrival of Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado. Called \"The Invader\" by the Mayan people, he immediately began subjugating the Indian states.","image":"Nakbe_str.JPG.webp","url":"History_of_Guatemala"}
