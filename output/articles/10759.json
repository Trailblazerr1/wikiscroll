{"title":"Company rule in India","summary":"Company rule in India (sometimes, Company Raj,[6] \"raj,\" lit. \"rule\" in Hindi[7]) refers to the rule or dominion of the  British East India Company on the Indian subcontinent. This is variously taken to have commenced in 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of Bengal surrendered his dominions to the Company,[8] in 1765, when the Company was granted the diwani, or the right to collect revenue, in Bengal and Bihar,[9] or in 1773, when the Company established a capital in Calcutta, appointed its first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and became directly involved in governance.[10] The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the Indian rebellion of 1857 and consequent of the Government of India Act 1858, the British government assumed the task of directly administering India in the new British Raj.","image":"India_british_expansion_1805a.jpg.webp"}
