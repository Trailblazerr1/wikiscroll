{"title":"Exhibitionism","summary":"Exhibitionism is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context one's intimate parts â€“ for example, the breasts, genitals or buttocks. The practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose themselves in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances, or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction, or to shock the bystander.[1] Exposing oneself only to an intimate partner is normally not regarded as exhibitionism. In law, the act of exhibitionism may be called indecent exposure, \"exposing one's person\", or other expressions.","image":"Streaker_Hong_Kong_1994.jpg.webp","url":"Exhibitionism"}
