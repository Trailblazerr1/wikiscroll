{"title":"Gun politics in the United States","summary":"Gun politics is an area of American politics defined by two primary opposing ideologies about civilian gun ownership. People who advocate for gun control support strengthening regulations related to gun ownership; people who advocate for gun rights oppose new regulations related to gun ownership. These groups often disagree on the interpretation of laws and court cases related to firearms as well as about the effects of firearms regulation on crime and public safety.[1]: 7  It is estimated that U.S. civilians own 393 million firearms,[2] and that 35% to 42% of the households in the country have at least one gun.[3][4] The U.S. has by far the highest estimated number of guns per capita in the world, at 120.5 guns for every 100 people.[5]","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp"}
