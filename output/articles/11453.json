{"title":"Credit default swap","summary":"A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that the seller of the CDS will compensate the buyer in the event of a debt default (by the debtor) or other credit event.[1] That is, the seller of the CDS insures the buyer against some reference asset defaulting. The buyer of the CDS makes a series of payments (the CDS \"fee\" or \"spread\") to the seller and, in exchange, may expect to receive a payoff if the asset defaults.","image":"CDS-nodefault.PNG.webp","url":"Credit_default_swap"}
