{"title":"Artificial cardiac pacemaker","summary":"A cardiac pacemaker (or artificial pacemaker, so as not to be confused with the natural pacemaker of the heart), is a medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by electrodes to cause the heart muscle chambers (the upper, or atria and/or the lower, or ventricles) to contract and therefore pump blood; by doing so this device replaces and/or regulates the function of the electrical conduction system of the heart.","image":"St_Jude_Medical_pacemaker_with_ruler.jpg.webp","url":"Artificial_cardiac_pacemaker"}
