{"title":"Prince William, Duke of Gloucester","summary":"Prince William, Duke of Gloucester (24 July 1689 – 30 July 1700[lower-alpha 1]), was the son of Princess Anne (later Queen of England, Ireland and Scotland from 1702) and her husband, Prince George of Denmark. He was their only child to survive infancy. Styled Duke of Gloucester, he was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the \"Glorious Revolution\" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather James II & VII the previous year.","image":"Prince_William_of_Denmark.jpg.webp"}
