{"title":"The Beatles (album)","summary":"The Beatles, also known as the White Album, is the ninth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 22 November 1968. It stands as the only  double album released by the band. Featuring a plain white sleeve, the cover contains no graphics or text other than the band's name embossed.[lower-alpha 1] This was intended as a direct contrast to the vivid cover artwork of the band's previous LP Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles is recognised for its fragmentary style and diverse range of genres, including folk, British blues, ska, music hall and the avant-garde. It has since been viewed by some critics as a postmodern work, as well as among the greatest albums of all time.[1]","image":"TheBeatles68LP.jpg.webp"}
