{"title":"Protein sequencing","summary":"Protein sequencing is the practical process of determining the amino acid sequence of all or part of a protein or peptide. This may serve to identify the protein or characterize its post-translational modifications. Typically, partial sequencing of a protein provides sufficient information (one or more sequence tags) to identify it with reference to databases of protein sequences derived from the conceptual translation of genes.","image":"lossy-page1-220px-Man_using_a_Beckman-Spinco_Protein-Peptide_Sequencer_bg257f292.tiff.jpg.webp","url":"Protein_sequencing"}
