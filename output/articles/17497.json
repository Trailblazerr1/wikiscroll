{"title":"Gastric bypass surgery","summary":"Gastric bypass surgery refers to a technique in which the stomach is divided into a small upper pouch and a much larger lower \"remnant\" pouch and then the small intestine is rearranged to connect to both. Surgeons have developed several different ways to reconnect the intestine, thus leading to several different gastric bypass procedures (GBP). Any GBP leads to a marked reduction in the functional volume of the stomach, accompanied by an altered physiological and physical response to food.","image":"Gastric_bypass_icon.svg.png.webp"}
