{"title":"Development of the Commercial Crew Program","summary":"Development of the Commercial Crew Program began in the second round of the Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program, which was rescoped from a technology development program for human spaceflight to a competitive development program that would produce the spacecraft to be used in the Commercial Crew Program to provide crew transportation services to and from the International Space Station (ISS). To implement the program NASA awarded a series of competitive fixed-price contracts to private vendors starting in 2011. Operational contracts to fly astronauts were awarded in September 2014 to SpaceX and Boeing.[1]  Each company performed an uncrewed orbital test flight in 2019, and operational flights started in November 2020.","image":"CST-100_mock-up_scene.jpg.webp","url":"Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program"}
