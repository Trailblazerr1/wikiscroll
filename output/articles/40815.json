{"title":"Sino-Indian War","summary":"The Sino-Indian War between China and India occurred in Octoberâ€“November 1962. A disputed Himalayan border was the main cause of the war. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, when India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama. India initiated a defensive Forward Policy from 1960 to hinder Chinese military patrols and logistics, in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the McMahon Line, the eastern portion of the Line of Actual Control proclaimed by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in 1959.[15]","image":"Indian_soldiers_on_patrol_during_the_1962_Sino-Indian_border_war.jpg.webp","url":"Sino-Indian_War"}
