{"title":"Doner kebab","summary":"Doner kebab (also spelled döner kebab) (UK: /ˈdɒnər kɪˈbæb/, US: /ˈdoʊnər kɪˈbɑːb/; Turkish: döner or döner kebap [dœˈneɾ ceˈbap]) is a type of kebab, made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie.[1] Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and has inspired similar dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, Canadian donair, and Mexican al pastor.[2][3][4]","image":"Döner_Kebab%2C_Berlin%2C_2010_(01).jpg.webp"}
