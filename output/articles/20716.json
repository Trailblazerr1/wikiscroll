{"title":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity","summary":"Homogeneity and heterogeneity are concepts often used in the sciences and statistics relating to the uniformity of a substance or organism. A material or image that is homogeneous is uniform in composition or character (i.e. color, shape, size, weight, height, distribution, texture, language, income, disease, temperature, radioactivity, architectural design, etc.); one that is heterogeneous is distinctly nonuniform in one of these qualities.[1][2]","image":"Homogène_hétérogène.png.webp","url":"Homogeneity_and_heterogeneity"}
