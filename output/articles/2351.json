{"title":"Afro-Brazilians","summary":"Afro-Brazilians (Portuguese: afro-brasileiros; Portuguese pronunciation: [ˈafɾu bɾɐziˈle(j)ɾuz]) are Brazilians who have predominantly or partial African ancestry (see \"preto\"). Most members of another group of people, multiracial Brazilians or pardos, may also have a range of degree of African ancestry. Depending on the circumstances (situation, locality, etc.), the ones whose African features are more evident are always or frequently seen by others as \"africans\" - consequently identifying themselves as such, while the ones for whom this evidence is lesser may not be seen as such as regularly. It is important to note that the term pardo, such as preto, is rarely used outside the census spectrum. Brazilian society has a range of words, including negro itself, to describe multiracial people.[6][7]","image":"3ª_Marcha_das_Mulheres_Negras_no_Centro_do_Mundo%2C_no_RJ_-_35465233613.jpg.webp","url":"Afro-Brazilians"}
