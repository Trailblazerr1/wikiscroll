{"title":"Frank Zappa","summary":"Frank Vincent Zappa[nb 1] (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American musician, singer, composer, songwriter, and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity, and satire of American culture.[2] In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral  and musique concrète works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist.[3] Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse musicians of his generation.[4][5]","image":"Zappa_16011977_01_300.jpg.webp","url":"Frank_Zappa"}
