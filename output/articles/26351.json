{"title":"List of American League pennant winners","summary":"Each Major League Baseball (MLB) season, one American League (AL) team wins the pennant, signifying that they are the league's champion and have the right to play in the World Series against the champion of the National League (NL). The pennant was presented to the team with the best winâ€“loss record each year through the 1968 season,[1] after which the AL Championship Series (ALCS) was introduced to decide the pennant winner.[2] The first modern World Series was played in 1903 and, after a hiatus in 1904, has taken place every season except 1994,[2] when a players' strike forced the cancellation of the postseason.[3] The current AL pennant holders are the Houston Astros who won the pennant on October 22, 2021.","image":"1926_New_York_Yankees_team.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_American_League_pennant_winners"}
