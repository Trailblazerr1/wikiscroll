{"title":"Centaur (small Solar System body)","summary":"In planetary astronomy, a centaur is a small Solar System body with either a perihelion or a semi-major axis between those of the outer planets. Centaurs generally have unstable orbits because they cross or have crossed the orbits of one or more of the giant planets; almost all their orbits have dynamic lifetimes of only a few million years,[1] but there is one \nknown centaur, 514107 Kaʻepaokaʻawela, which may be in a stable (though retrograde) orbit.[2][note 1] Centaurs typically exhibit the characteristics of both asteroids and comets. They are named after the mythological centaurs that were a mixture of horse and human. Observational bias toward large objects makes determination of the total centaur population difficult.  Estimates for the number of centaurs in the Solar System more than 1 km in diameter range from as low as 44,000[1] to more than 10,000,000.[4][5]","image":"Kuiper_belt_plot_objects_of_outer_solar_system.png.webp"}
