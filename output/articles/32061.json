{"title":"Nigersaurus","summary":"Nigersaurus is a genus of rebbachisaurid sauropod dinosaur that lived during the middle Cretaceous period, about 115 to 105 million years ago. It was discovered in the Elrhaz Formation in an area called Gadoufaoua, in the Republic of Niger. Fossils of this dinosaur were first described in 1976, but it was only named Nigersaurus taqueti in 1999, after further and more complete remains were found and described. The genus name means \"Niger reptile\", and the specific name honours the palaeontologist Philippe Taquet, who discovered the first remains.","image":"Nigersaurus_mount.jpg.webp"}
