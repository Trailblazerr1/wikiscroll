{"title":"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn","summary":"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the debut album by English rock band Pink Floyd, the only album made under founding member Syd Barrett's leadership. It was released on 5 August 1967 by EMI Columbia.[7] The studio album borrows its name from the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows, which refers to the nature god Pan, who plays his pan pipes at dawn. The album was recorded at EMI Studios in London's Abbey Road from February to May 1967.  The band consisted of Barrett (lead vocals, lead guitar), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals).  Barrett was the band's primary songwriter, though two tracks on the album are credited to the band collectively and one track was written by Waters.  The album was produced by Norman Smith, who would go on to produce two more albums for Pink Floyd.","image":"PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg.webp"}
