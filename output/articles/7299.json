{"title":"Boston (album)","summary":"Boston is the eponymous debut studio album by American rock band Boston. Produced by Tom Scholz and John Boylan,[2] it was released on August 25, 1976, in the United States by Epic Records. Scholz had studied classical piano in his childhood and became involved in the Boston music scene in the late 1960s. He subsequently started to concentrate on demos recorded in his apartment basement with singer Brad Delp; they had received numerous rejection letters from major record labels in the early 1970s. By 1975, the demo tape had fallen into the hands of CBS-owned Epic Records, who signed them.","image":"BostonBoston.jpg.webp"}
