{"title":"Residual-current device","summary":"A residual-current device (RCD), or residual-current circuit breaker (RCCB), is a safety device that quickly breaks an electrical circuit to protect equipment and to reduce the risk of serious harm from an ongoing electric shock.[1] Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human receives a brief shock before the electrical circuit is isolated, falls after receiving a shock, or if the person touches both conductors at the same time.[2]","image":"Residential_GFCI_receptacle.jpg.webp","url":"Residual-current_device"}
