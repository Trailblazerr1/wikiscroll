{"title":"In vitro fertilisation","summary":"In vitro fertilisation (IVF) is a process of fertilisation where an egg is combined with sperm in vitro (\"in glass\"). The process involves monitoring and stimulating a person's ovulatory process, removing an ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from their ovaries and letting sperm fertilise them in a culture medium in a laboratory. After the fertilised egg (zygote) undergoes embryo culture for 2â€“6 days, it is implanted in a uterus, with the intention of establishing a successful pregnancy.","image":"Blausen_0060_AssistedReproductiveTechnology.png.webp","url":"In_vitro_fertilisation"}
