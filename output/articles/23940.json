{"title":"Joseon","summary":"Joseon (also transcribed as Chosŏn, Korean: 대조선국; 大朝鮮國, lit. 'Great Joseon State') was a Korean dynastic kingdom that lasted for approximately five centuries.[14] It was the last dynastic kingdom of Korea.[15] It was founded by Yi Seong-gye in July 1392 and replaced by the Korean Empire in October 1897.[16] The kingdom was founded following the aftermath of the overthrow of Goryeo in what is today the city of Kaesong. Early on, Korea was retitled and the capital was relocated to modern-day Seoul. The kingdom's northernmost borders were expanded to the natural boundaries at the rivers of Amnok and Tuman through the subjugation of the Jurchens.","image":"Flag_of_the_king_of_Joseon.svg.png.webp"}
