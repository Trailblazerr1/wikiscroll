{"title":"Landrace","summary":"A landrace is a domesticated, locally adapted,[1][2][3] traditional variety[4] of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through adaptation to its natural and cultural environment of agriculture and pastoralism, and due to isolation from other populations of the species.[1] Landraces are generally distinguished from cultivars, and from breeds in the standardized sense, although the term landrace breed is sometimes used as distinguished from the term standardized breed  when referring to cattle.[5]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Landrace"}
