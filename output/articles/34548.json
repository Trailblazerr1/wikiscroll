{"title":"Personal relationships of Michael Jackson","summary":"The personal relationships of Michael Jackson have been the subject of public and media attention for several decades. He was introduced to the topic of sexual activity at the age of nine while a member of the Jackson 5. He and his brothers would perform at strip clubs, sharing the bill with female strippers and drag queens, and the sexual adventures of his brothers with groupies further affected Jackson's early life. The entertainer said his first real girlfriend was  the child actress Tatum O'Neal,[1] when he was a teenager in the 1970s; he called her \"my first love â€“ after Diana Ross.\"[2] The pair eventually \"cooled off\" and Jackson entered into a romance with model Brooke Shields in 1981. Although the relationship was platonic, Shields said there were times he had asked her to marry him, but as he grew older he started to change physically and became more asexual towards her.[3]","image":"Michael_Jackson_1988.jpg.webp"}
