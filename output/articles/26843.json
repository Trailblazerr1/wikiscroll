{"title":"List of freshwater islands in Scotland","summary":"The freshwater islands in Scotland include those within freshwater lochs and rivers â€“ including tidal areas, so the islands may not always be surrounded by freshwater. It has been estimated that there are at least 31,460 freshwater lochs in Scotland and that 1.9 per cent of the land surface is covered by freshwater. The distribution has a north-west to south-east gradient, with the highest concentrations occurring on the islands of the Outer Hebrides.[2][Note 1]","image":"Lochlevencastle.jpg.webp"}
