{"title":"Basic research","summary":"Basic research, also called pure research or fundamental research, is a type of scientific research with the aim of improving scientific theories for better understanding and prediction of natural or other phenomena.[1]  In contrast, applied research uses scientific theories to develop technology or techniques which can be used to intervene and alter natural or other phenomena. Though often driven simply by curiosity,[2] basic research often fuels the technological innovations of applied science.[3]  The two aims are often practiced simultaneously in coordinated research and development.","image":"Nuvola_apps_kalzium.svg.png.webp"}
