{"title":"Reproductive isolation","summary":"The mechanisms of reproductive isolation are a collection of evolutionary mechanisms, behaviors and physiological processes critical for speciation. They prevent members of different species from producing offspring, or ensure that any offspring are sterile. These barriers maintain the integrity of a species by reducing gene flow between related species.[1][2][3][4]","image":"Reproductive_Isolation_on_California_Salamander_population.png.webp"}
