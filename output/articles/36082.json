{"title":"Prince of Wales","summary":"Prince of Wales (Welsh: Tywysog Cymru, Welsh pronunciation: [təˈwəsog ˈkəmrɨ]) is a title traditionally and ceremonially granted to the heir apparent of the British throne as a personal honour or dignity, and is not heritable, with it being merged with the Crown on accession to the throne. Since 1301, the title Earl of Chester has been given in conjunction with that of Prince of Wales.[1] The Prince of Wales usually has other titles and honours, if the eldest son of the monarch; typically this means being Duke of Cornwall, which, unlike being Prince of Wales, inherently includes lands and constitutional and operational responsibilities. Since the 14th century, the title has been a dynastic title granted by the king or queen to the heir apparent to the English or British monarch, but the failure to be granted the title does not affect the rights to royal succession.","image":"Prince_of_Wales's_feathers_Badge.svg.png.webp"}
