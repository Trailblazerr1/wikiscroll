{"title":"Chamber pop","summary":"Chamber pop (sometimes called ork-pop,[1][2] short for \"orchestral pop\")[1][7] is a musical genre, characterized as a hybrid of rock music[1] with the intricate use of strings, horns, piano, and vocal harmonies, and other components drawn from the orchestral and lounge pop of the 1960s, with an emphasis on melody and texture. Artists such as Burt Bacharach and the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson (especially the band's 1966 album Pet Sounds) were formative acts during the genre's original wave in the 1960s.","image":"The_High_Llamas_(5928653004).jpg.webp"}
