{"title":"Halal","summary":"Halal (/həˈlɑːl/; Arabic: حلال‎, ḥalāl) is an Arabic word that translates to \"permissible\" in English. In the Quran, the word halal is contrasted with haram (forbidden). This binary opposition was elaborated into a more complex classification known as \"the five decisions\": mandatory, recommended, neutral, reprehensible and forbidden.[1] Islamic jurists disagree on whether the term halal covers the first two or the first four of these categories.[1] In recent times, Islamic movements seeking to mobilize the masses and authors writing for a popular audience have emphasized the simpler distinction of halal and haram.[2][3]","image":"Halal_word_in_Arabic.png.webp","url":"A%2fHalal"}
