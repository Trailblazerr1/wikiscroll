{"title":"Populism","summary":"Populism refers to a range of political stances that emphasize the idea of \"the people\" and often juxtapose this group against \"the elite\". The term developed in the late 19th century in connection to the Populist Party and has been applied to various politicians, parties and movements since that time, often derisively by opponents. Within political science and other social sciences, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.","image":"Occupy_Wall_Street_sign_in_Queens%2C_NYC.jpg.webp","url":"Populism"}
