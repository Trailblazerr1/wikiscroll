{"title":"Hydrocarbon","summary":"In organic chemistry, a hydrocarbon is an organic compound consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon.[1]: 620  Hydrocarbons are examples of group 14 hydrides. [2] Hydrocarbons are generally colourless and hydrophobic with only weak odours. Because of their diverse molecular structures, it is difficult to generalize further. Most anthropogenic emissions of hydrocarbons are from the burning of fossil fuels including fuel production and combustion. Natural sources of hydrocarbons such as ethylene, isoprene, and monoterpenes come from the emissions of vegetation.[3]","image":"Methane-3D-balls.png.webp","url":"Hydrocarbon"}
