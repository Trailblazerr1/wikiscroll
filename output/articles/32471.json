{"title":"Nougat","summary":"Nougat (US:  /ˈnuːɡət/ NOO-gət, UK: /ˈnuːɡɑː/ NOO-gah;[1][2][3][4] French: [nuɡa]; Azerbaijani: nuqa; Persian: نوقا‎) is a family of confections made with sugar or honey, roasted nuts (almonds, walnuts, pistachios, hazelnuts, and macadamia nuts are common), whipped egg whites, and sometimes chopped candied fruit. The consistency of nougat is chewy, and it is used in a variety of candy bars and chocolates. The word nougat comes from Occitan pan nogat (pronounced [ˈpaⁿ nuˈɣat]), seemingly from Latin panis nucatus 'nut bread' (the late colloquial Latin adjective nucatum means 'nutted' or 'nutty').","image":"Nougat.jpg.webp"}
