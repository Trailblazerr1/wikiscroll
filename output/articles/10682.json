{"title":"Common ethanol fuel mixtures","summary":"Several common ethanol fuel mixtures are in use around the world. The use of pure hydrous or anhydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines (ICEs) is only possible if the engines are designed or modified for that purpose, and used only in automobiles, light-duty trucks and motorcycles. Anhydrous ethanol can be blended with gasoline (petrol) for use in gasoline engines, but with high ethanol content only after minor engine modifications.","image":"Common_ethanol_fuel_mixtures.png.webp","url":"Common_ethanol_fuel_mixtures"}
