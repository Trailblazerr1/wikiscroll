{"title":"Milankovitch cycles","summary":"Milankovitch cycles describe the collective effects of changes in the Earth's movements on its climate over thousands of years. The term is named for Serbian geophysicist and astronomer Milutin MilankoviÄ‡. In the 1920s, he hypothesized that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession resulted in cyclical variation in the solar radiation reaching the Earth, and that this orbital forcing strongly influenced the Earth's climatic patterns.","image":"MilankovitchCyclesOrbitandCores.png.webp","url":"Milankovitch_cycles"}
