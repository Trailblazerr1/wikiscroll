{"title":"Ascomycota","summary":"Ascomycota is a phylum of the kingdom Fungi that, together with the Basidiomycota, forms the subkingdom Dikarya. Its members are commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes. It is the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 species.[2] The defining feature of this fungal group is the \"ascus\" (from Greek: ἀσκός (askos), meaning \"sac\" or \"wineskin\"), a microscopic sexual structure in which nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are asexual, meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores.  Familiar examples of sac fungi include morels, truffles, brewer's yeast and baker's yeast, dead man's fingers, and cup fungi. The fungal symbionts in the majority of lichens (loosely termed \"ascolichens\") such as Cladonia belong to the Ascomycota.","image":"Scarlet_elf_cap_cadnant_dingle.jpg.webp","url":"Ascomycota"}
