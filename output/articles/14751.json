{"title":"Empire State of Mind","summary":"\"Empire State of Mind\" is a song performed by American rapper Jay-Z featuring vocals by American singer Alicia Keys, from Jay-Z's 11th studio album, The Blueprint 3 (2009). Produced by Al Shux, the song features a music sample of \"Love on a Two-Way Street\" performed by The Moments. It was originally written by Angela Hunte and Janet Sewell-Ulepic as a tribute to their hometown, New York City. The following month, they submitted it to Jay-Z's label Roc Nation, whose reviews were a discouragement. They later took the suggestion of an associate of EMI Music Publishing and resubmitted it to Jay-Z, who kept the \"New York\" singing part on the hook, changed the verses, and recorded it.","image":"Empire_State_of_Mind_single_cover.jpg.webp"}
