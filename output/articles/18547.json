{"title":"Got Live If You Want It! (album)","summary":"Got Live If You Want It! is an album of mostly live recordings by the English rock band the Rolling Stones. It was released on 3 December 1966 by London Records in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful North American concert tour supporting their hit album Aftermath (1966).","image":"RollingStones-GotLiveIfYouWantIt.jpg.webp"}
