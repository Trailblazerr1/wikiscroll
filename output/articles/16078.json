{"title":"Fibrinogen","summary":"Fibrinogen (factor I) is a glycoprotein complex, made in the liver,[1] that circulates in the blood of all vertebrates.[2] During tissue and vascular injury, it is converted enzymatically by thrombin to fibrin and then to a fibrin-based blood clot. Fibrin clots function primarily to occlude blood vessels to stop bleeding. Fibrin also binds and reduces the activity of thrombin. This activity, sometimes referred to as antithrombin I, limits clotting.[1] Fibrin also mediates blood platelet and endothelial cell spreading, tissue fibroblast proliferation, capillary tube formation, and angiogenesis and thereby promotes revascularization and wound healing.[3]","image":"PDB_1m1j_EBI.jpg.webp"}
