{"title":"The Mary Tyler Moore Show","summary":"The Mary Tyler Moore Show (also known simply as Mary Tyler Moore) is an American television sitcom created by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns and starring actress and namesake Mary Tyler Moore. The show originally aired on CBS from September 19, 1970, to March 19, 1977. Moore starred as Mary Richards, an unmarried, independent woman focused on her career as associate producer of the fictional WJM news program in Minneapolis. A central female character who was neither married nor dependent on a man was a rarity on American television in the 1970s, leading to numerous publications citing The Mary Tyler Moore Show as a groundbreaking series in the era of second-wave feminism.[1] Ed Asner co-starred as Mary's boss Lou Grant, alongside Valerie Harper as friend and neighbor Rhoda Morgenstern and Cloris Leachman as friend Phyllis Lindstrom. Other co-stars throughout the series' run included Gavin MacLeod, Ted Knight, Georgia Engel, and Betty White.","image":"Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show_title_card.jpg.webp","url":"The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show"}
