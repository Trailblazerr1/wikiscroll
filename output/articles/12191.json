{"title":"David Bowie (1969 album)","summary":"David Bowie (commonly known as Space Oddity)[lower-alpha 1] is the second studio album by English musician David Bowie. After the commercial failure of his 1967 self-titled debut album, Bowie acquired a new manager, Kenneth Pitt, who commissioned a promotional film in hopes of widening the artist's audience. For the film, Bowie wrote a new song, titled \"Space Oddity\", a tale about a fictional astronaut. The song earned Bowie a contract with Mercury Records, who agreed to finance production of a new album, with Pitt hiring Tony Visconti to produce. Due to his dislike of the song, Visconti appointed engineer Gus Dudgeon to produce a re-recording for release as a lead single, while he produced the rest of the album.","image":"DavidBowiePhilips.jpg.webp","url":"David_Bowie_(1969_album)"}
