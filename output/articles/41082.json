{"title":"Snow in Florida","summary":"It is very rare for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, especially in the central and southern portions of the state. With the exception of the far northern areas of the state, most of the major cities in Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, though trace  amounts have been recorded, or flurries in the air observed few times each century. According to the National Weather Service, in the Florida Keys and Key West there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the European colonization of the region more than 300 years ago. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach there has been only one known report of snow flurries observed in the air in more than 200 years; this occurred in January 1977 (though debate exists as to if this was rime or snow). In any event, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach have not seen snow flurries before or since this 1977 event.","image":"Pensacola_Bay_Bridge_Ice.jpg.webp","url":"Snow_in_Florida"}
