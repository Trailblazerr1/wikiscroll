{"title":"Electric flux","summary":"In electromagnetism, electric flux is the measure of the electric field through a given surface,[1] although an electric field in itself cannot flow. It is a way of describing the electric field strength at any distance from the charge causing the field.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp"}
