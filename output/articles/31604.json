{"title":"Neighborhoods (Blink-182 album)","summary":"Neighborhoods is the sixth studio album by American rock band Blink-182, released September 27, 2011 through DGC Records and Interscope. Their first album of new material in eight years (the longest gap between albums to date), its recording followed the band's breakup and later reconciliation. Due to conflicts within the trio, the band entered an \"indefinite hiatus\" in 2005 and the members explored various side-projects. After two separate tragedies regarding the band and their entourage, the members of Blink-182 decided to reunite in late 2008, with plans for a new album and tour. It is the last studio album to feature the band's Enema of the State-era lineup before founding member Tom DeLonge left in January 2015.","image":"Blink-182_-_Neighborhoods_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Neighborhoods_(Blink-182_album)"}
