{"title":"Prolactinoma","summary":"A prolactinoma is a benign tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland that produces a hormone called prolactin. It is the most common type of functioning pituitary tumor.[1]  Symptoms of prolactinoma are due to too much prolactin in the blood (hyperprolactinemia), or those caused by pressure of the tumor on surrounding tissues.","image":"PRL_HE_histology.jpg.webp","url":"Prolactinoma"}
