{"title":"Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen","summary":"The Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen is an intervention launched by Saudi Arabia on 26 March 2015, leading a coalition of nine countries from West Asia and North Africa, responding to calls from the president of Yemen Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi for military support after he was ousted by the Houthi movement, despite the progress in the political transition led by the United Nations at that time. The conflict ignited between the government forces, the Houthi rebels and other armed groups after the draft constitution and power-sharing arrangements collapsed leading to an escalation of violence in mid-2014. The Houthis and allied units of the armed forces seized control of Sanaâ€™a and other parts of the country in September 2014 and in the following months. This prompted president Saleh to ask Saudi Arabia to intervene against the Iranian backed Houthis.","image":"Air_strike_in_Sana'a_11-5-2015.jpg.webp"}
