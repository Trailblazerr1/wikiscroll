{"title":"Cohen's kappa","summary":"Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) is a statistic that is used to measure inter-rater reliability (and also intra-rater reliability) for qualitative (categorical) items.[1] It is generally thought to be a more robust measure than simple percent agreement calculation, as κ takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. There is controversy surrounding Cohen's kappa due to the difficulty in interpreting indices of agreement. Some researchers have suggested that it is conceptually simpler to evaluate disagreement between items.[2]","image":"526650b8e2dddf1744981effa26203cd83d6cfc2.svg"}
