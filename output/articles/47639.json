{"title":"Vitreous body","summary":"The vitreous body (vitreous meaning \"glass-like\", from Latin vitreus, equivalent to vitr(um) glass + -eus -ous) is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eyeball (the vitreous chamber) in humans and other vertebrates. It is often referred to as the vitreous humor (also spelled humour, from Latin meaning liquid) or simply \"the vitreous\". Vitreous fluid or \"liquid vitreous\" is the liquid component of the vitreous gel, found after a vitreous detachment. It is not to be confused with the aqueous humor, the other fluid in the eye that is found between the cornea and lens.","image":"Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye_en.svg.png.webp"}
