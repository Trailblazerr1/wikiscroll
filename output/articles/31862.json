{"title":"New World monkey","summary":"New World monkeys are the five families of primates that are found in the tropical regions of Mexico, Central and South America: Callitrichidae, Cebidae, Aotidae, Pitheciidae, and Atelidae. The five families are ranked together as the Ceboidea /sɛˈbɔɪdiːə/, the only extant superfamily in the parvorder Platyrrhini /plætɪˈraɪnaɪ/.[3]\nPlatyrrhini means broad-nosed, and their noses are flatter than those of other simians, with sideways-facing nostrils. Monkeys in the family Atelidae, such as the spider monkey, are the only primates to have prehensile tails. New World monkeys' closest relatives are the other simians, the Catarrhini (\"down-nosed\"), comprising Old World monkeys and apes. New World monkeys descend from African simians that colonized South America, a line that split off about 40 million years ago.[4]","image":"BrownSpiderMonkey_(edit2).jpg.webp"}
