{"title":"Insulated-gate bipolar transistor","summary":"An insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a three-terminal power semiconductor device primarily used as an electronic switch, which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It consists of four alternating layers (P–N–P–N) that are controlled by a metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) gate structure.","image":"IGBT_3300V_1200A_Mitsubishi.jpg.webp"}
