{"title":"Trichophyton rubrum","summary":"Trichophyton rubrum is a dermatophytic fungus in the phylum Ascomycota. It is an exclusively clonal,[1] anthropophilic saprotroph that colonizes the upper layers of dead skin, and is the most common cause of athlete's foot, fungal infection of nail, jock itch, and ringworm worldwide.[2] Trichophyton rubrum was first described by Malmsten in 1845 and is currently considered to be a complex of species that comprises multiple, geographically patterned morphotypes, several of which have been formally described as distinct taxa, including T. raubitschekii, T. gourvilii, T. megninii and T. soudanense.[3][4][5]","image":"Trichophyton_rubrum_microconidia.jpg.webp"}
