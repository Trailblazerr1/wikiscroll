{"title":"Indigenous peoples","summary":"Indigenous peoples, also referred to as first peoples, first nations, aboriginal peoples, native peoples (with these terms often capitalized when referred to relating to specific countries), or autochthonous peoples, are culturally distinct ethnic groups who are native to a place which has been colonised and settled by a later ethnic group. The term indigenous was first, in its modern context, used by Europeans, who used it to differentiate the indigenous peoples of the Americas from the African and European new inhabitants. It may have first been used in this context by Sir Thomas Browne in 1646, who stated \"and although in many parts thereof there be at present swarms of Negroes serving under the Spaniard, yet were they all transported from Africa, since the discovery of Columbus; and are not indigenous or proper natives of America.\"[1][2]","image":"College_of_DuPage_Celebrates_Native_American_Culture_2020_54.jpg.webp","url":"Indigenous_peoples"}
