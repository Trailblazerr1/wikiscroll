{"title":"Understory","summary":"In forestry and ecology, understory (American English), or understorey (Commonwealth English), also known as underbrush or undergrowth, comprises plant life growing beneath the forest canopy without penetrating it to any great extent, but above the forest floor. Only a small percentage of light penetrates the canopy so understory vegetation is generally shade-tolerant. The understory typically consists of trees stunted through lack of light, other small trees with low light requirements, saplings, shrubs, vines and undergrowth. Small trees such as holly and dogwood are understory specialists.","image":"Celandine_Sward.JPG.webp","url":"Understory"}
