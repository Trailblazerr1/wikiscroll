{"title":"Kailua-Kona, Hawaii","summary":"Kailua, a town on the island of Hawaiʻi, is also known by its post office designation Kailua-Kona[1] to differentiate it from Kailua located on the windward side of Oʻahu island. (\"Kona\" is the Hawaiian term for \"leeward,\" and all of the Hawaiian Islands have a Kona district, though on some islands the term has fallen out of common use. Kailua-Kona is sometimes erroneously referred to by the name of the district, Kona, in which it is the largest town.) Kailua-Kona is an unincorporated town (Census Designated Place) in Hawaiʻi County, Hawaii, United States, in the North Kona District of the Island of Hawaiʻi.[2] The population was 11,975 at the 2010 census,[3] up from 9,870 at the 2000 census. It is the center of commerce and of the tourist industry on West Hawaiʻi. Kailua-Kona is served by Kona International Airport, located just to the north in the adjacent Kalaoa CDP.[4] Kailua-Kona was the closest major settlement to the epicenter of the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake.","image":"Kona_Mauka.jpg.webp"}
