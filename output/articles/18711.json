{"title":"Graphics Device Interface","summary":"The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is a legacy component of Microsoft Windows responsible for representing graphical objects and transmitting them to output devices such as monitors and printers. Windows apps use Windows API to interact with GDI, for such tasks as drawing lines and curves, rendering fonts, and handling palettes. The Windows USER subsystem uses GDI to render such UI elements as window frames and menus. Other systems have components that are similar to GDI; for example: macOS has Quartz and X Window System has X.Org Server.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Graphics_Device_Interface"}
