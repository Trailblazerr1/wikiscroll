{"title":"Angular diameter","summary":"The angular diameter, angular size, apparent diameter, or apparent size is an angular distance describing how large a sphere or circle appears from a given point of view. In the vision sciences, it is called the visual angle, and in optics, it is the angular aperture (of a lens). The angular diameter can alternatively be thought of as the angular displacement through which an eye or camera must rotate to look from one side of an apparent circle to the opposite side. Angular radius equals half of the angular diameter.","image":"Angular_dia_formula.JPG.webp","url":"Angular_diameter"}
