{"title":"Plasma cell","summary":"Plasma cells, also called plasma B cells, are white blood cells that originate in the lymphoid organs as B lymphocytes[1][2] and secrete large quantities of proteins called antibodies in response to being presented specific substances called antigens. These antibodies are transported from the plasma cells by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system to the site of the target antigen (foreign substance), where they initiate its neutralization or destruction. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modeled after the receptors of the precursor B cell.[3]","image":"Plasmacytoma_ultramini1.jpg.webp","url":"Plasma_cell"}
