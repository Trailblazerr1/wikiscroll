{"title":"Curriculum","summary":"In education, a curriculum (/kəˈrɪkjʊləm/; plural curricula /kəˈrɪkjʊlə/ or curriculums) is broadly defined as the totality of student experiences that occur in the educational process.[1][2]  The term often refers specifically to a planned sequence of instruction, or to a view of the student's experiences in terms of the educator's or school's instructional goals. A curriculum may incorporate the planned interaction of pupils with instructional content, materials, resources, and processes for evaluating the attainment of educational objectives.[3] Curricula are split into several categories: the explicit, the implicit (including the hidden), the excluded, and the extracurricular.[4][5][6]","image":"MMC_MD_Curriculum.png.webp"}
