{"title":"Detonation","summary":"Detonation (from Latin  detonareÂ 'to thunder down/forth'[1]) is a type of combustion involving a supersonic exothermic front accelerating through a medium that eventually drives a shock front propagating directly in front of it.  Detonations occur in both conventional solid and liquid explosives,[2] as well as in reactive gases.  The velocity of detonation in solid and liquid explosives is much higher than that in gaseous ones, which allows the wave system to be observed with greater detail (higher resolution).","image":"TNT_detonation_on_Kaho'olawe_Island_during_Operation_Sailor_Hat%2C_shot_Bravo%2C_1965.jpg.webp","url":"Detonation"}
