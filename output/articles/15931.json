{"title":"Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana","summary":"The Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana (FIMI) is an umbrella organisation that keeps track of virtually all aspects of the music recording industry in Italy. It was established in 1992, when major corporate labels left the previously existing Associazione dei Fonografici Italiani (AFI).[1][2] During the following years, most of the remaining Italian record labels left AFI to join the new organisation.[2] As of 2011, FIMI represents 2,500 companies operating in the music business.[3]","image":"FIMI_logo.png.webp","url":"Federazione_Industria_Musicale_Italiana"}
