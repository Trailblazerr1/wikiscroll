{"title":"Hockey stick graph","summary":"Hockey stick graphs present the global or hemispherical mean temperature record of the past 500 to 2000 years as shown by quantitative climate reconstructions based on climate proxy records. These reconstructions have consistently shown a slow long term cooling trend changing into relatively rapid warming in the 20th century, with the instrumental temperature record by 2000 exceeding earlier temperatures.","image":"page1-220px-T_comp_61-90.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Hockey_stick_graph"}
