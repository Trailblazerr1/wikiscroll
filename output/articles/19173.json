{"title":"Gundestrup cauldron","summary":"The Gundestrup cauldron is a richly decorated silver vessel, thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD,[1][2] or more narrowly between 150 BC and 1 BC.[3] This places it within the late La Tène period or early Roman Iron Age.  The cauldron is the largest known example of European Iron Age silver work (diameter: 69 cm (27 in); height: 42 cm (17 in)). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891 in a peat bog near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the Aars parish of Himmerland, Denmark (56°49′N 9°33′E).[4][5] It is now usually on display in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, with replicas at other museums; during 2015–16 it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called The Celts.[6]","image":"Silver_cauldron.jpg.webp","url":"Gundestrup_cauldron"}
