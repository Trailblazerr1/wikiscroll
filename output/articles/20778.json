{"title":"Hopewell tradition","summary":"The Hopewell tradition (also called the Hopewell culture) describes the common aspects of an ancient pre-Columbian Native American civilization that flourished in settlements along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern Eastern Woodlands from 100 BCE to 500 CE, in the Middle Woodland period. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of populations connected by a common network of trade routes.[1] This is known as the Hopewell exchange system.","image":"Hopewell_Exchange_Network_HRoe_2010.jpg.webp"}
