{"title":"Clotted cream","summary":"Clotted cream (Cornish: dehen molys, sometimes called scalded, clouted, Devonshire or Cornish cream) is a thick cream made by indirectly heating full-cream cow's milk using steam or a water bath and then leaving it in shallow pans to cool slowly. During this time, the cream content rises to the surface and forms \"clots\" or \"clouts\", hence the name.[1] It forms an essential part of a cream tea.","image":"Clotted_cream_(cropped).JPG.webp","url":"Clotted_cream"}
