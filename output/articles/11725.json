{"title":"Curly Howard","summary":"Jerome Lester Horwitz (October 22, 1903 â€“ January 18, 1952), known professionally as Curly Howard, was an American vaudevillian actor and comedian. He was best known as a member of the American comedy team the Three Stooges, which also featured his elder brothers Moe and Shemp Howard and actor Larry Fine. In early shorts, he was billed as Curley.  Curly Howard was generally considered the most popular and recognizable of the Stooges. He was well known for his high-pitched voice and vocal expressions (\"nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!\", \"woob-woob-woob!\", \"soitenly!\" [certainly], \"I'm a victim of soikemstance\", and barking like a dog), as well as his physical comedy (e.g., falling on the ground and pivoting on his shoulder as he \"walked\" in circular motion), improvisations, and athleticism.[1] An untrained actor, Curly borrowed (and significantly exaggerated) the \"woob woob\" from \"nervous\" and soft-spoken comedian Hugh Herbert.[2] Curly's unique version of \"woob-woob-woob\" was firmly established by the time of the Stooges' second Columbia film, Punch Drunks (1934).[1]","image":"Curlyhoward.jpg.webp","url":"Curly_Howard"}
