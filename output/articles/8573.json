Normally written as COS as a chemical formula that does not imply its structure, it is a colourless flammable gas with an unpleasant odor. It is a linear molecule consisting of a carbonyl group double bonded to a sulfur atom. Carbonyl sulfide can be considered to be intermediate between carbon dioxide and carbon disulfide, both of which are valence isoelectronic with it.","image":"Carbonyl-sulfide-2D-dimensions.png.webp","url":"Carbonyl_sulfide"}
