{"title":"Socioeconomic status","summary":"Socioeconomic status (SES) is an economic and sociological combined total measure of a person's work experience and of an individual's or family's economic access to resources and social position in relation to others.[1][2] When analyzing a family's SES, the household income, earners' education, and occupation are examined, as well as combined income, whereas for an individual's SES only their own attributes are assessed. Recently, research has revealed a lesser recognized attribute of SES as perceived financial stress, as it defines the \"balance between income and necessary expenses\".[3][4][5] Perceived financial stress can be tested by deciphering whether a person at the end of each month has more than enough, just enough, or not enough money or resources.[6][7] However, SES is more commonly used to depict an economic difference in society as a whole.[8]","image":"Jean_Eug√®ne_Buland_Almosen_eines_Bettlers_1880.jpg.webp","url":"Socioeconomic_status"}
