{"title":"Edgar Allan Poe bibliography","summary":"The works of American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans multiple genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he is credited with inventing.[1] These works are generally considered part of the Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism.[2] Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism[3] and allegory.[4] Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art.[5] Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs.[6] He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology[7] and physiognomy.[8] His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning.[9] Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not invent the genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.[10]","image":"Poe-Graham's-Magazine-1845-Vignette.jpg.webp"}
