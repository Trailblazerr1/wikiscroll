{"title":"Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge","summary":"The Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge (HZMB) is a 55-kilometre (34 mi) bridge–tunnel system consisting of a series of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel, and four artificial islands. It is both the longest sea crossing[5][6] and the longest open-sea fixed link in the world. The HZMB spans the Lingding and Jiuzhou channels, connecting Hong Kong, Macau, and Zhuhai—three major cities on the Pearl River Delta.[7]","image":"West_section_of_Hong_Kong-Zhuhai-Macau_Bridge_(20180902174105).jpg.webp"}
