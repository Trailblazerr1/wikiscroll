{"title":"Normal mode","summary":"A normal mode of an oscillating system is a pattern of motion in which all parts of the system move sinusoidally with the same frequency and with a fixed phase relation.  The free motion described by the normal modes takes place at fixed frequencies.  These fixed frequencies of the normal modes of a system are known as its natural frequencies or resonant frequencies.  A physical object, such as a building, bridge, or molecule, has a set of normal modes and their natural frequencies that depend on its structure, materials and boundary conditions. In music, normal modes of vibrating instruments (strings, air pipes, drums, etc.) are called \"harmonics\" or \"overtones\".","image":"Drum_vibration_mode12.gif","url":"Normal_mode"}
