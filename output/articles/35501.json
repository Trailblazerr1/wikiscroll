{"title":"Pope","summary":"The pope (Latin: papa, from Greek: πάππας, romanized: pappas, \"father\"),[2][3] also known as supreme pontiff (Pontifex maximus or Summus Pontifex) or Roman pontiff (Romanus Pontifex), is the bishop of Rome, head of the worldwide Catholic Church and head of state or sovereign of the Vatican City State.[4] According to Catholics, the primacy of the bishop of Rome is largely derived from his role as the apostolic successor to Saint Peter, to whom primacy was conferred by Jesus, giving him the Keys of Heaven and the powers of \"binding and loosing\", naming him as the \"rock\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013.[5]","image":"Canonization_2014-The_Canonization_of_Saint_John_XXIII_and_Saint_John_Paul_II_(14036966125).png.webp"}
