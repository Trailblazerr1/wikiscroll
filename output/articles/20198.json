{"title":"Hero (Mariah Carey song)","summary":"\"Hero\" is a song by American singer-songwriter, and record producer Mariah Carey released on October 19, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from her third studio album, Music Box (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written and produced by Carey and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting it over to the soundtrack of the film of the same name (1992). However, after being convinced by Sony executive Tommy Mottola to keep it, she changed some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that even though people may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, they are \"heroes\" if they look inside themselves and see their own inner strength; in time, it will help them \"find the way\".","image":"Hero_Mariah_Carey.png.webp","url":"Hero_(Mariah_Carey_song)"}
