{"title":"Secunderabad","summary":"Secunderabad /sɪkəndərˈɑːbɑːd/ ([sikŋdɾaːbaːd] (listen), also spelled sometimes as Sikandarabad) is the twin city of Hyderabad in the Indian state of Telangana. Named after Sikandar Jah, the third Nizam of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, Secunderabad was established in 1806 as a British cantonment. Although both the cities are together referred to as the twin cities, Hyderabad and Secunderabad have different histories and cultures, with Secunderabad having developed directly under British rule until 1948, and Hyderabad as the capital of the Nizams' princely state of Hyderabad.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
