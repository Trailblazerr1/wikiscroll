{"title":"Gluten","summary":"Gluten is a group of seed storage proteins found in certain cereal grains. Although, strictly speaking, \"gluten\" pertains only to wheat proteins, in the medical literature it refers to the combination of prolamin and glutelin proteins naturally occurring in all grains that have been demonstrated capable of triggering celiac disease. These include any species of wheat (such as common wheat, durum, spelt, khorasan, emmer and einkorn), barley, rye and some oat cultivars, as well as any cross hybrids of these grains (such as triticale).[1][2] Gluten comprises 75â€“85% of the total protein in bread wheat.[3][4]","image":"Gluten_Sources.png.webp"}
