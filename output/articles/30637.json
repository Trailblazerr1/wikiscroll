{"title":"Mound Builders","summary":"A number of pre-Columbian cultures are collectively termed \"Mound Builders\". The term does not refer to a specific people or archaeological culture, but refers to the characteristic mound earthworks erected for an extended period of more than 5,000 years. The \"Mound Builder\" cultures span the period of roughly 3500 BCE (the construction of Watson Brake) to the 16th century CE, including the Archaic period, Woodland period (Calusa culture, Adena and Hopewell cultures), and Mississippian period. Geographically, the cultures were present in the region of the Great Lakes, the Ohio River Valley, and the Mississippi River valley and its tributary waters.[1]","image":"Monks_Mound_in_July.JPG.webp"}
