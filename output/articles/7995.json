{"title":"Buttermilk","summary":"Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream.

It is common in warm climates where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly.[1]","image":"Buttermilk-(right)-and-Milk-(left).jpg.webp","url":"Buttermilk"}
