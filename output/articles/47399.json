{"title":"Vientiane","summary":"Vientiane (/viˌɛntiˈɑːn/ vi-EN-ti-AHN,[3] French: [vjɛ̃tjan]; Lao: ວຽງຈັນ, pronounced [ʋíːəŋ tɕàn]) is the capital and largest city of Laos, on the banks of the Mekong River near the border with Thailand. Vientiane became the capital in 1573, due to fears of a Burmese invasion, but was later looted, then razed to the ground in 1827 by the Siamese (Thai).[4] Vientiane was the administrative capital during French rule and, due to economic growth in recent times, is now the economic center of Laos. The city had a population of 948,477 as of the 2020 Census.","image":"Vientiane_-_Patuxai_-_0003.jpg.webp"}
