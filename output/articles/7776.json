{"title":"Bryophyte","summary":"Bryophytes are a proposed taxonomic division containing three groups of non-vascular land plants (embryophytes): the liverworts, hornworts and mosses.[1] They are characteristically limited in size and prefer moist habitats although they can survive in drier environments.[2] The bryophytes consist of about 20,000 plant species.[3][4] Bryophytes produce enclosed reproductive structures (gametangia and sporangia), but they do not produce flowers or seeds. They reproduce by  spore formation.[5] Though bryophytes were considered a paraphyletic group in recent years, almost all of the most recent phylogenetic evidence supports the monophyly of this group, as originally classified by Wilhelm Schimper in 1879.[6] The term bryophyte comes from Ancient Greek  βρύον (brúon) 'tree moss, liverwort', and  φυτόν (phutón) 'plant'.","image":"MarchantiophytaSp.NonDéterminéeFL3.jpg.webp"}
