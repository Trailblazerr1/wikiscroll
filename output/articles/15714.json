{"title":"Fall of communism in Albania","summary":"The fall of Communism in Albania, the last such event in Europe outside the USSR, started in earnest in December 1990 with student demonstrations in the capital, Tirana, although protests had begun earlier that year in other cities such as Shkodra and Kavaja.[1] The Central Committee of the communist Party of Labour of Albania allowed political pluralism on 11 December and the largest opposition party, the Democratic Party, was founded the next day.[2] March 1991 elections left the Party of Labour in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a \"stability government\" that included non-communists. Albania's former communists were routed in elections in March 1992 amid economic collapse and social unrest, with the Democratic Party winning most seats and its party head, Sali Berisha, becoming president.","image":"Fall_of_Communism_in_Albania.JPG.webp"}
