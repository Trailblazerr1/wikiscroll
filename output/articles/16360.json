{"title":"Flag of Bhutan","summary":"The national flag of Bhutan (Dzongkha: ཧྥ་རན་ས་ཀྱི་དར་ཆ་) is one of the national symbols of Bhutan. The flag features a dragon (druk [Wylie 'bruk] in Dzongkha, the Bhutanese language) from Bhutanese mythology. This alludes to the Dzongkha name of Bhutan – Druk Yul (འབྲུག་ཡུལ་, 'bruk yul, lit. \"Dragon Country\" or \"Dragon Kingdom\") – as well as the Drukpa Lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, which is the dominant religion of Bhutan. An alternative hypothesis maintains that the notion of symbolizing sovereignty and the state in the form of a dragon emerged in neighboring China and was adopted by the rulers of Bhutan as a symbol of royalty in the early 20th century.[2][3]","image":"Flag_of_Bhutan.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Bhutan"}
