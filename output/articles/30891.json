{"title":"Muscle contraction","summary":"Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle cells.[1][2] In physiology, muscle contraction does not necessarily mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length, such as when holding a heavy book or a dumbbell at the same position.[1] The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state.[1]","image":"Skeletal_muscle.jpg.webp","url":"Muscle_contraction"}
