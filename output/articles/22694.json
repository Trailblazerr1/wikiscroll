{"title":"J. M. W. Turner","summary":"Joseph Mallord William Turner RA (23 April 1775 – 19 December 1851), known in his time as William Turner,[lower-alpha 1] was an English Romantic painter, printmaker and watercolourist. He is known for his expressive colourisations, imaginative landscapes and turbulent, often violent marine paintings. He left behind more than 550 oil paintings, 2,000 watercolours, and 30,000 works on paper.[1] He was championed by the leading English art critic John Ruskin from 1840, and is today regarded as having elevated landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.[2]","image":"Joseph_Mallord_William_Turner_Self_Portrait_1799.jpg.webp","url":"J._M._W._Turner"}
