{"title":"Impacted wisdom teeth","summary":"Impacted wisdom teeth is a condition where the third molars (wisdom teeth) are prevented from erupting into the mouth.[1]  This can be caused by a physical barrier, such as other teeth, or when the tooth is angled away from a vertical position.[2] Completely unerupted wisdom teeth usually result in no symptoms, although they can sometimes develop cysts or neoplasms. Partially erupted wisdom teeth can develop cavities or pericoronitis. Removal of impacted wisdom teeth is advised in the case of certain pathologies, such as nonrestorable caries or cysts.[3]","image":"3D_CT_impacted_wisdom_tooth.Gif"}
