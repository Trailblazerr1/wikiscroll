{"title":"Gauge boson","summary":"In particle physics, a gauge boson is a bosonic elementary particle that mediates interactions among elementary fermions, and thus acts as a force carrier. Gauge bosons can carry any of the four fundamental interactions of nature.[1][2] Elementary particles, whose interactions are described by a gauge theory, interact with each other by the exchange of gauge bosons, usually as virtual particles.","image":"Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg.png.webp","url":"Gauge_boson"}
