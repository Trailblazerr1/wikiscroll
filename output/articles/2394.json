{"title":"Ageing","summary":"Ageing or aging (see spelling differences) is the process of becoming older. The term refers mainly to humans, many other animals, and fungi, whereas for example, bacteria, perennial plants and some simple animals are potentially biologically immortal.[1] Furthermore, ageing connotes a biological and social construct.[2] It is usually associated with dynamic changes in the biological, psychological, physiological, environmental, behavioral and social processes.[3] In the broader sense, aging can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing (cellular senescence) or to the population of a species (population aging).[4]","image":"Views_of_a_Foetus_in_the_Womb_detail.jpg.webp"}
