{"title":"Network congestion","summary":"Network congestion in data networking and queueing theory is the reduced quality of service that occurs when a network node or link is carrying more data than it can handle. Typical effects include queueing delay, packet loss or the blocking of new connections. A consequence of congestion is that an incremental increase in offered load leads either only to a small increase or even a decrease in network throughput.[1]","image":"e87000dd6142b81d041896a30fe58f0c3acb2158.svg"}
