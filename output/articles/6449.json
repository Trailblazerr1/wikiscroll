{"title":"Biblical apocrypha","summary":"The biblical apocrypha (from the Ancient Greek: ἀπόκρυφος, romanized: apókruphos, lit. 'hidden') denotes the collection of apocryphal ancient books thought to have been written some time between 200 BC and AD 400.[1][2][3][4][5] Some Christian churches include some or all of the same texts within the body of their version of the Old Testament, terming them deuterocanonical books.[6] Traditional 80 book Protestant Bibles include fourteen books in an intertestamental section between the Old Testament and New Testament called the Apocrypha, deeming these useful for instruction, but non-canonical.[7][8][9]","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp","url":"Biblical_apocrypha"}
