{"title":"Psychedelic rock","summary":"Psychedelic rock is rock music that is inspired, influenced, or representative of psychedelic culture, which is centered on perception-altering hallucinogenic drugs. The music is intended to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often applied spuriously.[2]","image":"Londons_Carnaby_Street%2C_1966.jpg.webp","url":"Psychedelic_rock"}
