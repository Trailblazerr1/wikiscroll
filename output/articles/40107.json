{"title":"Sermon","summary":"A sermon is an oration or lecture by a preacher (who is usually a member of clergy). Sermons address a scriptural, theological, or moral topic, usually expounding on a type of belief, law, or behavior within both past and present contexts. Elements of the sermon often include exposition, exhortation, and practical application. The act of delivering a sermon is called preaching.  In secular usage, the word sermon may refer, often disparagingly, to a lecture on morals.","image":"John_Pettie_-_A_roadside_sermon.jpg.webp","url":"Sermon"}
