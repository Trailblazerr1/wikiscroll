{"title":"Microwave","summary":"Microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from about one meter to one millimeter corresponding to frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz respectively.[1][2][3][4][5]  Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimeter wave) bands.  A more common definition in radio-frequency engineering is the range between 1 and 100 GHz (wavelengths between 0.3 m and 3 mm).[2]  In all cases, microwaves include the entire SHF band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum.    Frequencies in the microwave range are often referred to by their IEEE radar band designations: S, C, X, Ku, K, or Ka band, or by similar NATO or EU designations.","image":"Frazier_Peak%2C_tower_and_Honda_Element.jpg.webp"}
