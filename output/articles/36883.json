Rabbi Akiva was a leading contributor to the Mishnah and to Midrash halakha. He is also sometimes credited with redacting Abraham's version of the Sefer Yetzirah, one of the central texts of Jewish mysticism. He is referred to in the Talmud as Rosh la-Hakhamim \"Chief of the Sages\". He was executed by the Romans in the aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt.","image":"Akiva.png.webp"}
