{"title":"Hemiptera","summary":"Hemiptera (/hɛˈmɪptərə/; from Latin  hemipterus 'half-winged') is an order of insects, commonly called true bugs, comprising over 80,000 species within groups such as the cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, bed bugs, and shield bugs. They range in size from 1 mm (0.04 in) to around 15 cm (6 in), and share a common arrangement of sucking mouthparts.[3] The name \"true bugs\" is often limited to the suborder Heteroptera.[4] Many insects commonly known as \"bugs\", especially in American English, belong to other orders; for example, the lovebug is a fly[5] and the May bug and ladybug are beetles.[6]","image":"Hemiptera_suborders.jpg.webp"}
