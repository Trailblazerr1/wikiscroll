{"title":"Alcohol intoxication","summary":"Alcohol intoxication, also known as alcohol poisoning,[1] commonly described as drunkenness or inebriation,[10] is the negative behavior and physical effects caused by a recent consumption of alcohol.[6][11] In addition to the toxicity of ethanol, the main psychoactive component of alcoholic beverages, other physiological symptoms may arise from the activity of acetaldehyde, a metabolite of alcohol.[12] These effects may not arise until hours after ingestion and may contribute to the condition colloquially known as a hangover.","image":"Michelangelo_drunken_Noah.jpg.webp"}
