{"title":"Dari","summary":"Dari (دری, Darī, [dæɾiː]), or Dari Persian (فارسی دری, Fārsī-yi Darī), is a political term used for the various dialects of the Persian language spoken in Afghanistan.[4][5] Dari is the term officially recognised and promoted since 1964 by the Afghan government for the Persian language,[6][7] hence it is known as Afghan Persian or Eastern Persian in many Western sources.[8][9][10][11] As Professor Nile Green remarks \"the impulses behind renaming of Afghan Persian as Dari were more nationalistic than linguistic\" in order to create an Afghan state narrative.[12] Persian in Afghanistan is generally called Fārsi (فارسی) by Persian-speakers and Pārsi (پارسی) by ethnic Pashtuns. Apart from a few basics of vocabulary, there is little difference between formal written Persian of Afghanistan and Iran. The term \"Dari\" is officially used for the characteristic spoken Persian of Afghanistan, but is best restricted to formal spoken registers. Persian-speakers in Afghanistan contend that the term \"Dari\" has been forced on them by the dominant Pashtun ethnic group as an attempt to distance Afghanistan from its cultural, linguistic, and historical ties to the rest of the Persian-speaking world, which includes Iran, Tajikistan and parts of Uzbekistan.[13][14]","image":"Dari.png.webp"}
