{"title":"Union Stock Yards","summary":"The Union Stock Yard & Transit Co., or The Yards, was the meatpacking district in Chicago for more than a century, starting in 1865.  The district was operated by a group of railroad companies that acquired marshland and turned it into a centralized processing area.  By the 1890s, the railroad capital behind the Union Stockyards was Vanderbilt money.[1]  The Union Stockyards operated in the New City community area for 106 years,[2] helping Chicago become known as the \"hog butcher for the world\" and the center of the American meatpacking industry for decades.[3]","image":"Livestock_chicago_1947.jpg.webp"}
