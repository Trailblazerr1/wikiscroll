{"title":"Battle of Jutland","summary":"The Battle of Jutland (German: Skagerrakschlacht, the Battle of Skagerrak) was a naval battle fought between Britain's Royal Navy Grand Fleet, under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, and the Imperial German Navy's High Seas Fleet, under Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer, during the First World War. The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the North Sea coast of Denmark's Jutland Peninsula.[2] It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in that war.  Jutland was the third fleet action between steel battleships, following the Battle of the Yellow Sea in 1904[3][4] and the decisive Battle of Tsushima in 1905,[5] during the Russo-Japanese War.  Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships.[6] In terms of total ships displaced, it was the largest surface naval battle in history.","image":"Map_of_the_Battle_of_Jutland%2C_1916.svg.png.webp"}
