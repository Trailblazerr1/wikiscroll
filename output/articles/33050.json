{"title":"Op-ed","summary":"An op-ed, short for \"opposite the editorial page\" or as a backronym the \"opinions and editorials page,\" is a written prose piece, typically published by a North-American newspaper or magazine, which expresses the opinion of an author usually not affiliated with the publication's editorial board.[1] Op-eds are different from both editorials (opinion pieces submitted by editorial board members) and letters to the editor (opinion pieces submitted by readers). In 2021, The New York Times—the paper credited with developing and naming the modern op-ed page—announced that it was retiring the label, and would instead call submitted opinion pieces \"Guest Essays.\" The move was a result of the transition to online publishing, where there is no concept physically opposing (adjacent) pages.[2]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
