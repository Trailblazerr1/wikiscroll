{"title":"List of Adventure Time episodes","summary":"Adventure Time is an American animated television media franchise created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. The first series, Adventure Time (2010–2018), follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo. Throughout the series, they interact with the show's other main characters: Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom and a sentient piece of gum; the Ice King (Tom Kenny), a demented but largely misunderstood ice wizard; Marceline the Vampire Queen (Olivia Olson), a thousand-year-old vampire and rock music enthusiast; Lumpy Space Princess (Pendleton Ward), a melodramatic and immature princess made out of \"irradiated stardust\"; BMO (Niki Yang), a sentient video game console-shaped robot that lives with Finn and Jake; and Flame Princess (Jessica DiCicco), a flame elemental and ruler of the Fire Kingdom.[1][2] The pilot first aired in 2007 on Nicktoons Network,[3] where it was later re-aired on the incubator series Random! Cartoons.[4][5] The pilot was eventually uploaded onto the internet and became a cult hit on YouTube.[6] After Nickelodeon declined to turn the short into a full-fledged show, Cartoon Network purchased the rights, and Adventure Time launched as a series on April 5, 2010.[7][8] The series concluded its eight-year and ten-season run on September 3, 2018.[9] The series was followed by two limited-run spinoffs: Adventure Time: Distant Lands (2020–21) and Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake.","image":"Adventure_Time_logo.png.webp"}
