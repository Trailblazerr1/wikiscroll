{"title":"Winter storm","summary":"A winter storm is an event in which wind coincides with varieties of precipitation that only occur at freezing temperatures, such as snow, mixed snow and rain, or freezing rain. In temperate continental climates, these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well. A snowstorm with strong winds and other conditions meeting certain criteria is called a blizzard.","image":"Winter_Storm_Jonas_2016_NYC_Pershing_Square.jpg.webp","url":"Winter_storm"}
