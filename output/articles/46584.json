{"title":"Unhalfbricking","summary":"Unhalfbricking is the third album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention and their second album released in 1969. It is seen as a transitional album in their history and marked a further musical move away from American influences towards more traditional English folk songs that had begun on their previous album, What We Did on Our Holidays[1] and reached its peak on the follow-up, Liege & Lief, released later the same year.[2]","image":"Fairport_Convention-Unhalfbricking_(album_cover).jpg.webp","url":"Unhalfbricking"}
