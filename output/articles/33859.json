{"title":"Paraguayan War","summary":"The Paraguayan War, also known as the War of the Triple Alliance,[lower-alpha 1] was a South American war that lasted from 1864 to 1870. This war was fought between Paraguay and the Triple Alliance of Argentina, the Empire of Brazil, and Uruguay. It was the deadliest and bloodiest inter-state war in Latin American history.[4] Paraguay sustained large casualties, but even the approximate numbers are disputed. Paraguay was forced to cede disputed territory to Argentina and Brazil. The war began in late 1864, as a result of a conflict between Paraguay and Brazil caused by the Uruguayan War. Argentina and Uruguay entered the war against Paraguay in 1865, and it then became known as the \"War of the Triple Alliance\".","image":"Escenas_de_la_Guerra_de_la_Triple_Alianza.png.webp","url":"Paraguayan_War"}
