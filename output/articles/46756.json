{"title":"United States congressional committee","summary":"A congressional committee is a legislative sub-organization in the United States Congress that handles a specific duty (rather than the general duties of Congress). Committee membership enables members to develop specialized knowledge of the matters under their jurisdiction. As \"little legislatures\", the committees monitor ongoing governmental operations, identify issues suitable for legislative review, gather and evaluate information, and recommend courses of action to their parent body. Woodrow Wilson once wrote, \"it is not far from the truth to say that Congress in session is Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee rooms is Congress at work.\"[1] It is not expected that a member of Congress be an expert on all matters and subject areas that come before Congress.[2] Congressional committees provide valuable informational services to Congress by investigating and reporting about specialized subjects.","image":"United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Armed_Services%2C_Levin_D-MI_%26_Warner_R-VA%2C_7-31-2007.jpg.webp","url":"United_States_congressional_committee"}
