{"title":"Optical cavity","summary":"An optical cavity, resonating cavity or  optical resonator is an arrangement of mirrors that forms a standing wave cavity resonator for light waves. Optical cavities are a major component of lasers, surrounding the gain medium and providing feedback of the laser light. They are also used in optical parametric oscillators and some interferometers. Light confined in the cavity reflects multiple times, producing standing waves for certain resonance frequencies. The standing wave patterns produced are called modes; longitudinal modes differ only in frequency while transverse modes differ for different frequencies and have different intensity patterns across the cross-section of the beam.","image":"Glass_nanoparticle_suspended_in_an_optical_cavity.png.webp","url":"Optical_cavity"}
