{"title":"Keith Emerson","summary":"Keith Noel Emerson (2 November 1944 â€“ 11 March 2016) was an English keyboardist, songwriter, and record producer. He played keyboards in a number of bands before finding his first commercial success with the Nice in the late 1960s.[1] He became internationally famous for his work with the Nice, which included writing rock arrangements of classical music.[2] After leaving the Nice in 1970, he was a founding member of Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP), one of the early progressive rock supergroups. Emerson, Lake & Palmer were commercially successful through much of the 1970s, becoming one of the best-known progressive rock groups of the era.[1] Emerson wrote and arranged much of ELP's music on albums such as Tarkus (1971) and Brain Salad Surgery (1973), combining his own original compositions with classical or traditional pieces adapted into a rock format.[3]","image":"Keith_Emerson_StPetersburg_Aug08.jpg.webp","url":"Keith_Emerson"}
