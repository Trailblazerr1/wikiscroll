{"title":"Oncology","summary":"Oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. A medical professional who practices oncology is an oncologist.[1] The name's etymological origin is the Greek word ὄγκος (óngkos), meaning 1. \"burden, volume, mass\" and 2. \"barb\", and the Greek word λόγος (logos), meaning \"study\".[2] The neoclassical term oncology was used from 1618, initially in neo-Greek, in cognizance of Galen's work on abnormal tumors, De tumoribus præter naturam (Περὶ τῶν παρὰ φύσιν ὄγκων).[3]","image":"Tumor_Mesothelioma2_legend.jpg.webp"}
