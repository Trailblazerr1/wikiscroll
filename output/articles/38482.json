{"title":"Rook (chess)","summary":"The rook (/rʊk/; ♖, ♜) is a piece in the game of chess resembling a castle. Formerly the piece (from Persian رخ rokh/rukh, meaning chariot) was alternatively called the tower, marquess, rector, and comes (count or earl) (Sunnucks 1970). The term castle is considered to be informal, incorrect, or old-fashioned.[1][2]","image":"Chess_piece_-_White_rook.JPG.webp"}
