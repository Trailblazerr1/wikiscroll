{"title":"Nótt","summary":"In Norse mythology, Nótt (Old Norse: [ˈnoːtː], \"night\"[1]) is night personified, grandmother of Thor.[2] In both the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, composed in the 13th century, Nótt is listed as the daughter of a figure by the name of Nörvi (with variant spellings) and is associated with the horse Hrímfaxi, while the Prose Edda features information about Nótt's ancestry, including her three marriages. Nótt's third marriage was to the god Dellingr and this resulted in their son Dagr, the personified day (although some manuscript variations list Jörð as Dellingr's wife and Dagr's mother instead). As a proper noun, the word nótt appears throughout Old Norse literature.","image":"Peter_Nicolai_Arbo_-_Natten_-_Nasjonalmuseet_-_NG.M.03666.jpg.webp"}
