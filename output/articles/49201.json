{"title":"Yellow journalism","summary":"Yellow journalism and yellow press are American terms for journalism and associated newspapers that present little or no legitimate, well-researched news while instead using eye-catching headlines for increased sales.[1]  Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering, or sensationalism. By extension, the term yellow journalism is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion.[2]","image":"Newspaper_nicu_buculei_01.svg.png.webp","url":"Yellow_journalism"}
