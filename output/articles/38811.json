{"title":"Rutherglen","summary":"Rutherglen (/ˌrʌðərˈɡlɛn/, Scots: Ruglen, Scottish Gaelic: An Ruadh-Ghleann) is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, immediately south-east of the city of Glasgow – 3 miles (4.8 km) from its centre – and directly south of the River Clyde. Having existed as a Lanarkshire burgh in its own right for more than 800 years, in 1975 Rutherglen lost its own local council and administratively became a component of the City of Glasgow District Council within the Strathclyde region (along with neighbouring Cambuslang).[3] In 1996 the towns were reallocated to the South Lanarkshire council area.[4][5][6]","image":"Rutherglen_Main_St%2C_2016-03-07.jpg.webp","url":"Rutherglen"}
