{"title":"The Crown","summary":"The Crown is the state in all its aspects within the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth realms and their subdivisions (such as Crown Dependencies, overseas territories, provinces, or states).[1] Legally ill-defined, the term has different meanings depending on context. It is used to designate the monarch in either a personal capacity, as Head of the Commonwealth, or as the king or queen of his or her realms. It can also refer to the rule of law; however, in common parlance 'The Crown' refers to the functions of government and the civil service.[2]","image":"Queen_Elizabeth_II_in_March_2015.jpg.webp","url":"The_Crown"}
