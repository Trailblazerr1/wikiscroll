{"title":"La Isla Bonita","summary":"\"La Isla Bonita\" (Spanish pronunciation: [la ˈizla βoˈnita]; English: \"The Beautiful Island\") is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue (1986). It was released as the album's fifth and final single on February 25, 1987, by Sire Records. The song was written and produced by Madonna and Patrick Leonard, with additional songwriting by Bruce Gaitsch. The initial composition of the song was first offered to Michael Jackson before Madonna both accepted it and wrote the lyrics and melody. \"La Isla Bonita\" is noted for being the first Madonna song to contain Latin influences, with arrangements of Cuban drums and Spanish guitar, maracas, harmonicas, and a mix of synthesized and real drumming. The lyrics of the song tell about a \"beautiful island\" and, according to Madonna, was a tribute to the beauty of the Latinos.","image":"Madonna%2C_La_Isla_Bonita_cover.png.webp"}
