{"title":"Compact sport utility vehicle","summary":"A compact sport utility vehicle or compact SUV is a class of small sport utility vehicles that is larger than mini SUVs, but smaller than mid-size SUVs. However, there is no official definition of the size or dimensions for this market segment. Moreover, some manufacturers have marketed the same model name on different sized vehicles over time. The most common distinction between versions of crossover automobiles and compact-sized SUVs is that the first is based on a car-based unibody platform, while an SUV uses the body-on-frame chassis commonly used on trucks.[1] However, manufacturers and common usage has blurred the two terms.[2] Many recent vehicles labelled as compact SUVs are technically compact crossovers and are built on the platform of a compact/C-segment passenger car.","image":"99-01_Suzuki_Grand_Vitara.jpg.webp","url":"Compact_sport_utility_vehicle"}
