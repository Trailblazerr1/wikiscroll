{"title":"Laocoön and His Sons","summary":"The statue of Laocoön and His Sons, also called the Laocoön Group (Italian: Gruppo del Laocoonte), has been one of the most famous ancient sculptures ever since it was excavated in Rome in 1506 and placed on public display in the Vatican,[2] where it remains.  It is very likely the same statue that was praised in the highest terms by the main Roman writer on art, Pliny the Elder.[3]  The figures are near life-size and the group is a little over 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in height, showing the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents.[1]","image":"Laocoon_and_His_Sons.jpg.webp","url":"Laocoön_and_His_Sons"}
