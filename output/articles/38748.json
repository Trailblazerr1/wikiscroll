{"title":"Running of the bulls","summary":"A running of the bulls (Spanish: encierro, from the verb encerrar, 'to corral, to enclose'; Occitan: abrivado, literally 'haste, momentum'; Catalan: correbous, 'run-bulls') is an event that involves running in front of a small group of bulls, typically six[1] but sometimes ten or more, that have been let loose on sectioned-off streets in a town,[1] usually as part of a summertime festival. Particular breeds of cattle may be favored, such as the toro bravo in Spain,[1] also often used in post-run bullfighting, and Camargue cattle in Occitan France, which are not fought.  Bulls (non-castrated male cattle) are typically used in such events.","image":"Sanfermines_Vaquillas_Pamplona_08.jpg.webp"}
