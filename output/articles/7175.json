{"title":"Bonaire","summary":"Bonaire (/bɒnˈɛər/;[7] Dutch: Bonaire, pronounced [boːˈnɛːr(ə)] (listen);[8] Papiamento: Boneiru, [buˈneiru]) is an island in the Leeward Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital is Kralendijk, near the ocean on the lee side of the island. Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao form the ABC islands, 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of Venezuela.[9] Unlike much of the Caribbean region, the ABC islands lie outside Hurricane Alley. The islands have an arid climate that attracts visitors seeking warm, sunny weather all year round. Bonaire is a popular snorkeling and scuba diving destination because of its multiple shore diving sites and easy access to the island's fringing reefs.","image":"Bonaire_1.jpg.webp","url":"Bonaire"}
