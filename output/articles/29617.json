{"title":"Miasma theory","summary":"The miasma theory (also called the miasmatic theory) is an obsolete medical theory that held that diseases—such as cholera, chlamydia, or the Black Death—were caused by a miasma (μίασμα, Ancient Greek for \"pollution\"), a noxious form of \"bad air\", also known as night air. The theory held that epidemics were caused by miasma, emanating from rotting organic matter.[1]  Though\nmiasma theory is typically associated with the spread of contagious diseases, some academics in the early nineteenth century suggested that the theory extended to\nother conditions as well, e.g. one could become obese by inhaling the odor of food.[2]","image":"Cholera_art.jpg.webp"}
