{"title":"Wilhelm Wundt","summary":"Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt (/vʊnt/; German: [vʊnt]; 16 August 1832 – 31 August 1920) was a German physiologist, philosopher, and professor, known today as one of the fathers of modern psychology. Wundt, who distinguished psychology as a science from philosophy and biology, was the first person ever to call himself a psychologist.[1] He is widely regarded as the \"father of experimental psychology\".[2][3] In 1879, at University of Leipzig, Wundt founded the first formal laboratory for psychological research. This marked psychology as an independent field of study.[4] By creating this laboratory he was able to establish psychology as a separate science from other disciplines. He also formed the first academic journal for psychological research, Philosophische Studien (from 1881 to 1902), set up to publish the institute's research.[5]","image":"Wilhelm_Wundt.jpg.webp"}
