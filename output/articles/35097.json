{"title":"Pitman shorthand","summary":"Pitman shorthand is a system of shorthand for the English language developed by Englishman Sir Isaac Pitman (1813â€“1897), who first presented it in 1837.[1] Like most systems of shorthand, it is a phonetic system; the symbols do not represent letters, but rather sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken.[2]","image":"Pitman.png.webp"}
