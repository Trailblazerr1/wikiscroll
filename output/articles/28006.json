{"title":"Magnetic monopole","summary":"In particle physics, a magnetic monopole is a hypothetical elementary particle that is an isolated magnet with only one magnetic pole (a north pole without a south pole or vice versa).[1][2] A magnetic monopole would have a net north or south \"magnetic charge\". Modern interest in the concept stems from particle theories, notably the grand unified and superstring theories, which predict their existence.[3][4] The known elementary particles that have electric charge are electric monopoles.","image":"CuttingABarMagnet.svg.png.webp"}
