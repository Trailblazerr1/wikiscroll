{"title":"Unix philosophy","summary":"The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to minimalist, modular software development. It is based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software; these norms became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the \"Unix philosophy.\"","image":"Ken_Thompson_and_Dennis_Ritchie--1973.jpg.webp","url":"Unix_philosophy"}
