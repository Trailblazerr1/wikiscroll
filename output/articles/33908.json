{"title":"Parathyroid gland","summary":"Parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck of humans and other tetrapods. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, located on the back of the thyroid gland in variable locations. The parathyroid gland produces and secretes parathyroid hormone in response to a low blood calcium, which plays a key role in regulating the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.","image":"Parathyroid_es.svg.png.webp","url":"Parathyroid_gland"}
