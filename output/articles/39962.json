{"title":"Self-awareness","summary":"In philosophy of self, self-awareness is the experience of one's own personality or individuality.[1][2] It is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of qualia. While consciousness is being aware of one's environment and body and lifestyle, self-awareness is the recognition of that awareness.[3] Self-awareness is how an individual consciously knows and understands their own character, feelings, motives, and desires. There are two broad categories of self-awareness: internal self-awareness and external self-awareness.[4]","image":"Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Painter_and_the_Buyer%2C_ca._1566_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp","url":"Self-awareness"}
