{"title":"St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle","summary":"St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in England is a chapel built in the late-medieval Perpendicular Gothic style. It is both a Royal Peculiar (a church under the direct jurisdiction of the monarch) and the Chapel of the Order of the Garter. It is located in the Lower Ward of the castle.[1]\nSt George's castle chapel was originally founded in the 14th century by King Edward III and extensively enlarged in the late 15th century. It has been the scene of many royal services, weddings and, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries, burials. Although occasional monarchs and their consorts were buried at the castle from the 15th century, it was not until the 19th century that St George's Chapel and the nearby Frogmore Gardens superseded Westminster Abbey as the chosen burial place for the British royal family.[2] Windsor Castle is a principal residence of Queen Elizabeth II.","image":"St._Georges_Chapel%2C_Windsor_Castle_(2).jpg.webp"}
