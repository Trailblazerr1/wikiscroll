{"title":"Control chart","summary":"Control charts, also known as Shewhart charts (after Walter A. Shewhart) or process-behavior charts, are a statistical process control tool used to determine if a manufacturing or business process is in a state of control.  It is more appropriate to say that the control charts are the graphical device for Statistical  Process Monitoring (SPM). Traditional control charts are mostly designed to monitor process parameters when underlying form of the process distributions are known. However, more advanced techniques are available in the 21st century where incoming data streaming can-be monitored even without any knowledge of the underlying process distributions.  Distribution-free control charts are becoming increasingly popular.","image":"Xbar_chart_for_a_paired_xbar_and_R_chart.svg.png.webp"}
