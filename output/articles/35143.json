{"title":"Planck (spacecraft)","summary":"Planck was a space observatory operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) from 2009 to 2013, which mapped the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at microwave and infrared frequencies, with high sensitivity and small angular resolution.  The mission substantially improved upon observations made by the NASA Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP).  Planck provided a major source of information relevant to several cosmological and astrophysical issues, such as testing theories of the early Universe and the origin of cosmic structure. Since the end of its mission, Planck has defined the most precise measurements of several key cosmological parameters, including the average density of ordinary matter and dark matter in the Universe and the age of the universe.","image":"Front_view_of_the_European_Space_Agency_Planck_satellite.jpg.webp"}
