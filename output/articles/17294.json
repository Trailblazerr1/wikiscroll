{"title":"Gabriel Fauré","summary":"Gabriel Urbain Fauré (French: [ɡabʁiɛl yʁbɛ̃ fɔʁe];[1] 12 May 1845 – 4 November 1924)[n 1] was a French composer, organist, pianist and teacher. He was one of the foremost French composers of his generation, and his musical style influenced many 20th-century composers. Among his best-known works are his Pavane, Requiem, Sicilienne, nocturnes for piano and the songs \"Après un rêve\" and \"Clair de lune\". Although his best-known and most accessible compositions are generally his earlier ones, Fauré composed many of his most highly regarded works in his later years, in a more harmonically and melodically  complex style.","image":"Faure1907.jpg.webp","url":"Gabriel_Fauré"}
