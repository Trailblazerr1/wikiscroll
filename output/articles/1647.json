{"title":"World War III","summary":"World War III or the Third World War, often abbreviated as WWIII or WW3, are names given to a hypothetical third worldwide large-scale military conflict subsequent to World War I and World War II. The term has been in use since at least as early as 1941. Some apply it loosely to refer to limited or smaller conflicts such as the Cold War or the War on Terror, while others assume that such a conflict would surpass prior world wars in both scope and destructive impact.[1]","image":"Castle_romeo2.jpg.webp"}
