{"title":"Language family","summary":"A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a common ancestral language or parental language, called the proto-language of that family. The term \"family\" reflects the tree model of language origination in historical linguistics, which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages to people in a biological family tree, or in a subsequent modification, to species in a phylogenetic tree of evolutionary taxonomy. Linguists therefore describe the daughter languages within a language family as being genetically related.[1]","image":"Primary_Human_Languages_Improved_Version.png.webp","url":"Language_family"}
