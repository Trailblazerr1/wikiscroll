{"title":"Netbook","summary":"The marketing term netbook identified small and inexpensive  laptops that were sold from 2007 to around 2013; these were generally low-performance. While the name has fallen out of use, machines matching their description remain an important part of the market for laptops running Microsoft Windows. Similarly, most lower-end Chromebooks run on hardware which would have been described as \"Netbooks\" when the term was current, and inexpensive tablets (running either Windows or  Android) when used with an external keyboard are functionally equivalent to netbooks.","image":"HP_2133_Mini-Note_PC_(front_view_compare_with_pencil).jpg.webp"}
