{"title":"List of Green Bay Packers retired numbers","summary":"The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Since their founding in 1919, over 1,700 players,[1] including 31 Pro Football Hall of Famers[2] have played for the team. Of those 31, 6 players have had their uniform numbers officially retired by the organization.[3] Professional sports franchises, including the Packers, retire uniform numbers to recognize the contributions that a player has made towards the team. It is customary that after the uniform number is retired, it is no longer worn by future players with that team. These uniform numbers are usually prominently displayed within the team's arena or stadium. In the case of the Packers, the retired numbers are displayed above the box seats in the north end zone of Lambeau Field.[4]","image":"Packers_Retired_Numbers_at_Lambeau_Field.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Green_Bay_Packers_retired_numbers"}
