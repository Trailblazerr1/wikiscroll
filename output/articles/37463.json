{"title":"Reform Party of Canada","summary":"The Reform Party of Canada (French: Parti r√©formiste du Canada) was a right-wing populist[1][2] and conservative federal political party in Canada that existed from 1987 to 2000. Reform was founded as a Western Canada-based protest movement that eventually became a populist conservative party, with strong Christian right influence and social conservative elements. It was initially motivated by the perceived need for democratic reforms and by profound Western Canadian discontent with the Progressive Conservative (PC) federal government of Brian Mulroney.","image":"Reform_Party_of_Canada-Parti_reformiste_du_Canada_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Reform_Party_of_Canada"}
