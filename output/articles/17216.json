{"title":"Fuse (electrical)","summary":"In electronics and electrical engineering, a fuse is an electrical safety device that operates to provide overcurrent protection of an electrical circuit.  Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby stopping or interrupting the current. It is a sacrificial device; once a fuse has operated it is an open circuit, and must be replaced or rewired, depending on its type.","image":"Tektronixoscilloscope442backfuse-ccbysawikipedia.jpg.webp","url":"Fuse_(electrical)"}
