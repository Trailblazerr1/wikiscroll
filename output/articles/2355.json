{"title":"Afro-Mexicans","summary":"Afro-Mexicans (Spanish: afromexicanos), also known as Black Mexicans (Spanish: mexicanos negros),[2] are Mexicans who have heritage from Sub-Saharan Africa[3][2] and identify as such. As a single population, Afro-Mexicans include individuals descended from both free and enslaved black Africans who arrived to Mexico during the colonial era,[3] as well as post-independence migrants. The latter include Afro-descended people from neighboring English, French, and  Spanish-speaking countries of the Caribbean and Central America, descendants of enslaved Africans who escaped to Mexico from the Deep South during Slavery in the United States, and to a lesser extent recent migrants directly from Africa. Today, there are localized communities in Mexico with significant although not predominant African ancestry. These are mostly concentrated in specific communities, including the populations of the Costa Chica of Oaxaca, Huetamo, Michoacán, Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, Guerrero, Veracruz and some cities in northern Mexico.","image":"El_Costeño.jpg.webp"}
