{"title":"The Ashes","summary":"The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and Australia. The term originated in a satirical obituary published in a British newspaper, The Sporting Times, immediately after Australia's 1882 victory at The Oval, its first Test win on English soil. The obituary stated that English cricket had died, and \"the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia\".[1] The mythical ashes immediately became associated with the 1882â€“83 series played in Australia, before which the English captain Ivo Bligh had vowed to \"regain those ashes\". The English media therefore dubbed the tour the quest to regain the Ashes.","image":"Ashes_Urn.jpg.webp"}
