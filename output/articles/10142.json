{"title":"Civil service","summary":"The civil service is a collective term for a sector of government composed mainly of career civil servants hired on professional merit rather than appointed or elected, whose institutional tenure typically survives transitions of political leadership. A civil servant  is a person employed in the public sector by a government department or agency for public sector undertakings. Civil servants work for central government and state governments, and answer to the government, not a political party.[1][2] The extent of civil servants of a state as part of the \"civil service\" varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom, for instance, only Crown (national government) employees are referred to as civil servants whereas employees of Local Authorities (counties, cities and similar administrations) are generally referred to as \"local government civil service officers\" who are public servants but not civil servants. A civil servant is a public servant but a public servant is not necessarily a civil servant.","image":"Exam_cells-large.jpg.webp","url":"Civil_service"}
