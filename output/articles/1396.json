{"title":"Norepinephrine","summary":"Norepinephrine (NE), also called noradrenaline (NA) or noradrenalin, is an organic chemical in the catecholamine family that functions in the brain and body as both a hormone and neurotransmitter. The name \"noradrenaline\", derived from Latin roots meaning \"at/alongside the kidneys\", is more commonly used in the United Kingdom; in the United States, \"norepinephrine\", derived from Greek roots having that same meaning, is usually preferred.[2] \"Norepinephrine\" is also the international nonproprietary name given to the drug.[3] Regardless of which name is used for the substance itself, parts of the body that produce or are affected by it are referred to as noradrenergic.","image":"Norepinephrine.svg.png.webp"}
