{"title":"BCG vaccine","summary":"Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis (TB).[6] It is named after its inventors Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin.[7][8] In countries where tuberculosis or leprosy is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as soon after birth as possible.[6] In areas where tuberculosis is not common, only children at high risk are typically immunized, while suspected cases of tuberculosis are individually tested for and treated.[6] Adults who do not have tuberculosis and have not been previously immunized but are frequently exposed may be immunized as well.[6] BCG also has some effectiveness against Buruli ulcer infection and other nontuberculous mycobacteria infections.[6] Additionally it is sometimes used as part of the treatment of bladder cancer.[9][10]","image":"Mycobacterium_bovis_BCG_ZN.jpg.webp","url":"BCG_vaccine"}
