{"title":"Slum","summary":"A slum is a highly populated urban residential area consisting of densely packed housing units of weak build quality. The infrastructure in slums is often deteriorated or incomplete, and they are primarily inhabited by impoverished people.[1] Although slums are usually located in urban areas, in other countries they can be located in suburban areas where housing quality is low and living conditions are poor.[2] While slums differ in size and other characteristics, most lack reliable sanitation services, supply of clean water, reliable electricity, law enforcement, and other basic services. Slum residences vary from shanty houses to professionally built dwellings which, because of poor-quality construction or lack of basic maintenance, have deteriorated.[3]","image":"Karail03.jpg.webp","url":"Slum"}
