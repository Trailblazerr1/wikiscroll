The competition is contested by UEFA membersâ€™ senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the European Nations' Cup, changing to the current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"UEFA Euro [year]\".","image":"Coupe_Henri_Delaunay_2017.jpg.webp"}
