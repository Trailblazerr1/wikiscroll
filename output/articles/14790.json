{"title":"Endangered language","summary":"An endangered language or moribund language is a language that is at risk of disappearing as its speakers die out or shift to speaking other languages. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a \"dead language\". If no one can speak the language at all, it becomes an \"extinct language\". A dead language may still be studied through recordings or writings, but it is still dead or extinct unless there are fluent speakers.[1] Although languages have always become extinct throughout human history, they are currently dying at an accelerated rate because of globalization, imperialism, neocolonialism[2] and linguicide (language killing).[3]","image":"Linguistic_diversity.png.webp"}
