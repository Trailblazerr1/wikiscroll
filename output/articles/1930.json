{"title":"Aboriginal Tasmanians","summary":"The Aboriginal Tasmanians (Palawa kani: Palawa or Pakana[4]) are the Aboriginal people of the Australian island of Tasmania, located south of the mainland. For much of the 20th century, the Tasmanian Aboriginal people were widely, and erroneously, thought of as being an extinct cultural and ethnic group that had been intentionally exterminated by white settlers.[5] Contemporary figures (2016) for the number of people of Tasmanian Aboriginal descent vary according to the criteria used to determine this identity, ranging from 6,000 to over 23,000.[1][2]","image":"Last_of_the_Tasmanians_Woodcut_6_-_Wooreddy.jpg.webp","url":"Aboriginal_Tasmanians"}
