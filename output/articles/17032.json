{"title":"French Fifth Republic","summary":"The Fifth Republic (French: Cinquième République) is France's current republican system of government. It was established 4 October 1958 by Charles de Gaulle under the Constitution of the Fifth Republic.[1] The Fifth Republic emerged from the collapse of the Fourth Republic, replacing the former parliamentary republic with a semi-presidential (or dual-executive) system[2] that split powers between a president as head of state and a prime minister as head of government.[3] De Gaulle, who was the first French president elected under the Fifth Republic in December 1958, believed in a strong head of state, which he described as embodying l'esprit de la nation (\"the spirit of the nation\").[4]","image":"Flag_of_France_(1794–1815%2C_1830–1958).svg.png.webp"}
