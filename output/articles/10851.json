{"title":"Concept album","summary":"A concept album is an album whose tracks hold a larger purpose or meaning collectively than they do individually.[2][3] This is typically achieved through a single central narrative or theme, which can be instrumental, compositional, or lyrical.[4] Sometimes the term is applied to albums considered to be of \"uniform excellence\" rather than an LP with an explicit musical or lyrical motif.[5] There is no consensus among music critics as to the specific criteria for what a \"concept album\" is.[3][6]","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-1990-0722-401%2C_Berlin%2C_Auff√ºhrung_der_Rockoper_\"The_Wall\".jpg.webp","url":"Concept_album"}
