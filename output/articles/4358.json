{"title":"Ariadne","summary":"Ariadne (/ˌæriˈædni/; Greek: Ἀριάδνη; Latin: Ariadne) was a Cretan princess in Greek mythology. She was mostly associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of the Minotaur and Theseus. She is best known for having helped Theseus escape the Minotaur but being abandoned by him on the island of Naxos; subsequently, she became the wife of Dionysus.  (There are many other versions of her myth.)","image":"Bacchus_and_Ariadne_LACMA_M.79.63.jpg.webp"}
