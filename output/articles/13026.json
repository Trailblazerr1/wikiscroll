{"title":"Dim sum","summary":"Dim sum (traditional Chinese: 點心; simplified Chinese: 点心; pinyin: diǎnxīn; Cantonese Yale: dímsām) is a large range of small Chinese dishes that are traditionally enjoyed in restaurants for brunch.[1][2] Most modern dim sum dishes originated in China and are commonly associated with Cantonese cuisine, although dim sum dishes also exist in other Chinese cuisines. In the tenth century, when the city of Guangzhou (Canton) began to experience an increase in commercial travel,[3] many frequented teahouses for small-portion meals with tea called yum cha, or \"drink tea\" meals.[4][3][5] Yum cha includes two related concepts.[6] The first is \"yat jung leung gin\" (一盅兩件), which translates literally as \"one cup, two pieces\". This refers to the custom of serving teahouse customers two pieces of delicately made food items, savory or sweet, to complement their tea. The second is dim sum (點心) and translates literally to \"touching heart\", the term used to designate the small food items that accompanied the tea drinking.","image":"Dim_sum.jpg.webp","url":"Dim_sum"}
