{"title":"Prostate cancer","summary":"Prostate cancer is cancer of the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system that surrounds the urethra just below the bladder.[6] Most prostate cancers are slow growing.[1][3] Cancerous cells may spread to other areas of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes.[7] It may initially cause no symptoms.[1] In later stages, symptoms include pain or difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis or back.[2] Benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms.[1] Other late symptoms include fatigue, due to low levels of red blood cells.[1]","image":"Diagram_showing_the_position_of_the_prostate_and_rectum_CRUK_358.svg.png.webp"}
