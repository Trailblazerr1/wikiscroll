{"title":"NF-κB","summary":"NF-κB (or NF-kappaB, \"nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells\") is a protein complex that controls transcription of DNA, cytokine production and cell survival. NF-κB is found in almost all animal cell types and is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, heavy metals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidized LDL, and bacterial or viral antigens.[2][3][4][6][7] NF-κB plays a key role in regulating the immune response to infection. Incorrect regulation of NF-κB has been linked to cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, septic shock, viral infection, and improper immune development. NF-κB has also been implicated in processes of synaptic plasticity and memory.[8][9][10][11][12][13]","image":"NFKB_mechanism_of_action.png.webp","url":"NF-κB"}
