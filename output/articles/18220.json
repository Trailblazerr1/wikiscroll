{"title":"Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point","summary":"A Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) is an internationally agreed upon reference point on a stratigraphic section which defines the lower boundary of a stage on the geologic time scale.  The effort to define GSSPs is conducted by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, a part of the International Union of Geological Sciences.  Most, but not all, GSSPs are based on paleontological changes.  Hence GSSPs are usually described in terms of transitions between different faunal stages, though far more faunal stages have been described than GSSPs.  The GSSP definition effort commenced in 1977.  As of 2021, 76 of the 104 stages that need a GSSP have a ratified GSSP.[1]","image":"Ediacaran-GSSP-IMGP6652-.jpg.webp","url":"Global_Boundary_Stratotype_Section_and_Point"}
