In the modern era, all billiards tables (whether for carom billiards, pool, pyramid or snooker) provide a flat surface usually made of quarried slate, that is covered with cloth (usually of a tightly woven worsted wool called baize), and surrounded by vulcanized rubber cushions, with the whole thing elevated above the floor.[1]: 115, 238  More specific terms are used for specific sports, such as snooker table and pool table, and different-sized billiard balls are used on these table types. An obsolete term is billiard board, used in the 16th and 17th centuries.[1]: 27 [2]","image":"A_carom_table_in_Café_Zéphyr%2C_Paris%2C_France%2C_14_January_2007.jpg.webp","url":"Billiard_table"}
