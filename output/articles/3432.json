{"title":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis","summary":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a neurodegenerative disease[lower-alpha 1] that results in the progressive loss of motor neurons that control voluntary muscles.[2][10][11] ALS is the most common type of motor neuron disease.[12][13] Early symptoms of ALS include stiff muscles, muscle twitches, and gradual increasing weakness and muscle wasting.[2] Limb-onset ALS begins with weakness in the arms or legs, while bulbar-onset ALS begins with difficulty speaking or swallowing.[2][9] Half of the people with ALS develop at least mild difficulties with thinking and behavior, and about 15% develop frontotemporal dementia.[8] Most people experience pain.[14] The affected muscles are responsible for chewing food, speaking, and walking.[2] Motor neuron loss continues until the ability to eat, speak, move, and finally the ability to breathe is lost.[2] ALS eventually causes paralysis and early death, usually from respiratory failure.[15]","image":"ALS_Coronal.jpg.webp","url":"Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis"}
