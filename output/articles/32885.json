{"title":"Olivine","summary":"The mineral olivine (/ˈɒl.ɪˌvin/) is a magnesium iron silicate with the chemical formula (Mg2+, Fe2+)2SiO4. It is a type of nesosilicate or orthosilicate. The primary component of the Earth's upper mantle,[8] it is a common mineral in Earth's subsurface, but weathers quickly on the surface. For this reason, olivine has been proposed as a good candidate for accelerated weathering to sequester carbon dioxide from the Earth's oceans and atmosphere, as part of climate change mitigation. Olivine also has many other historical uses, such as the gemstone peridot (or chrysolite), as well as industrial applications like metalworking processes.","image":"Olivine_in_polarizing_light.jpg.webp","url":"Olivine"}
