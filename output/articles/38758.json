{"title":"Rush (band)","summary":"Rush was a Canadian rock band formed in Toronto in 1968 by Alex Lifeson (guitars, composer), John Rutsey (drums, percussion, lyricist), and Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Geddy Lee (bass, vocals, keyboards, composer). After its formation the band went through several lineup configurations before arriving at its classic power trio lineup with the addition of Neil Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their self-titled debut album. This lineup remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.","image":"Rush-in-concert.jpg.webp","url":"Rush_(band)"}
