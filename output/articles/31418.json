{"title":"National Rally","summary":"The National Rally (French: Rassemblement national, pronounced [ʁasɑ̃bləmɑ̃ nasjɔnal]; RN), until June 2018 known as the National Front (French: Front national, pronounced [fʁɔ̃ nasjɔnal]; FN), is a far-right political party in France.[16] Since its inception, it has primarily been an anti-immigration party, advocating significant cuts to legal immigration and protection of French identity,[21] and stricter control of illegal immigration. The National Rally has opposed the European Union (EU) and its predecessor organisations since its foundation in 1972. It also supports French economic interventionism, protectionism, as well as a zero tolerance approach towards law and order.[14]","image":"Logo_Rassemblement_National.svg.png.webp"}
