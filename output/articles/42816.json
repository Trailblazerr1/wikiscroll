{"title":"Super Meat Boy","summary":"Super Meat Boy is a 2010 platform game designed by Edmund McMillen and Tommy Refenes under the collective name of \"Team Meat\". It was self-published as the successor to Meat Boy, a 2008 flash game designed by McMillen and Jonathan McEntee. In the game, the player controls Meat Boy, a red, cube-shaped character, as he attempts to rescue his girlfriend, Bandage Girl, from the game's antagonist Dr. Fetus. The gameplay is characterized by fine control and split-second timing, as the player runs and jumps through over 300Â hazardous levels while avoiding obstacles. The game also supports the creation of player-created levels. Super Meat Boy was first released on the Xbox 360 through Xbox Live Arcade in October 2010, and was later ported to Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and the Nintendo Switch.","image":"SuperMeatBoy_cover.png.webp","url":"Super_Meat_Boy"}
