{"title":"Trichotillomania","summary":"Trichotillomania (TTM), also known as hair pulling disorder or compulsive hair pulling, is a mental disorder characterized by a long-term urge that results in the pulling out of one's own hair.[2][4] This occurs to such a degree that hair loss can be seen.[2] A brief positive feeling may occur as hair is removed.[5] Efforts to stop pulling hair typically fail. Hair removal may occur anywhere; however, the head and around the eyes are most common. The hair pulling is to such a degree that it results in distress.[1]","image":"Trichotillomania_1.jpg.webp"}
