{"title":"Paul Revere & the Raiders","summary":"Paul Revere & the Raiders (also known as Raiders) were an American rock band formed in Boise, Idaho in 1958. They saw considerable U.S. mainstream success in the second half of the 1960s and early 1970s, with music veering from garage rock to psychedelic pop, but their early sound combined fast-paced, guitar-and-vocal-dominated rock and roll with an intimidating R&B flavor.[1] The band was known for including Revolutionary War-style clothes in their attire.","image":"Paul_Revere_and_the_Raiders_1967.JPG.webp","url":"Paul_Revere_&_the_Raiders"}
