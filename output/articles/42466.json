{"title":"Stream","summary":"A stream is a body of water[1] with surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel. The flow of a stream is controlled by three inputs – surface water, subsurface water and groundwater. The surface and subsurface water are highly variable between periods of rainfall. Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation.[2] The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls.[3]","image":"Aubach_(Wiehl)_nahe_dem_Weiherdamm_in_Wildbergerhütte.jpg.webp"}
