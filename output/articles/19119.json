{"title":"Guided bus","summary":"Guided buses are buses capable of being steered by external means, usually on a dedicated track or roll way that excludes other traffic, permitting the maintenance of schedules even during rush hours. Unlike trolleybuses or rubber-tired trams, for part of their routes guided buses are able to share road space with general traffic along conventional roads, or with conventional buses on standard bus lanes.","image":"Yibin_ART_System_10_15_43_362000.jpeg.webp","url":"Guided_bus"}
