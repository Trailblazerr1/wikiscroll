{"title":"Received Pronunciation","summary":"Received Pronunciation (often abbreviated as RP) is the accent traditionally regarded as the standard for British English.[1] For over a century there has been argument over such issues as the definition of RP, whether it is geographically neutral, how many speakers there are, whether sub-varieties exist, how appropriate a choice it is as a standard and how the accent has changed over time.[2] RP is an accent, so the study of RP is concerned only with matters of pronunciation; other areas relevant to the study of language standards such as vocabulary, grammar and style are not considered.","image":"RP_English_monophthongs_chart.svg.png.webp"}
