{"title":"Great American Novel","summary":"The Great American Novel (sometimes abbreviated as GAN) is a canonical novel that is thought to embody the essence of America, generally written by an American and dealing in some way with the question of America's national character. The term was coined by John William De Forest in an 1868 essay. Although De Forest mentioned Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe as a possible contender, he noted that the Great American Novel had most likely not been written yet. Writer Henry James used the shortened term, GAN, in 1880.","image":"Edwin_Longsden_Long_-_Uncle_Tom_and_Little_Eva.JPG.webp","url":"Great_American_Novel"}
