{"title":"Azeotrope","summary":"An azeotrope (/əˈziːəˌtroʊp/)[1] or a constant boiling point mixture is a mixture of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered or changed by simple distillation.[2] This happens because when an azeotrope is boiled, the vapour has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture. Because their composition is unchanged by distillation, azeotropes are also called (especially in older texts) constant boiling point mixtures.","image":"VLEIsoropanolWaterAzeotrope.png.webp"}
