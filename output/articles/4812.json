{"title":"Atlantic Wall","summary":"The Atlantic Wall (German: Atlantikwall) was an extensive system of coastal defences and fortifications built by Nazi Germany between 1942 and 1944 along the coast of continental Europe and Scandinavia as a defence against an anticipated Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe from the United Kingdom, during World War II.  The manning and operation of the Atlantic Wall was administratively overseen by the German Army, with some support from Luftwaffe ground forces.  The Kriegsmarine (German Navy) maintained a separate coastal defence network, organised into a number of sea defence zones.[1]","image":"Atlantikwall.png.webp"}
