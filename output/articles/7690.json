{"title":"Brontosaurus","summary":"Brontosaurus (/ˌbrɒntəˈsɔːrəs/[1][2]; meaning \"thunder lizard\" from Greek βροντή, brontē \"thunder\" and σαῦρος, sauros \"lizard\") is a genus of gigantic quadruped sauropod dinosaurs. Although the type species, B. excelsus, had long been considered a species of the closely related Apatosaurus,[3] researchers proposed in 2015 that Brontosaurus is a genus separate from Apatosaurus and that it contains three species: B. excelsus, B. yahnahpin, and B. parvus.[4]","image":"Brontosaurus_Yale_Peabody_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Brontosaurus"}
