{"title":"Curie temperature","summary":"In physics and materials science, the Curie temperature (TC), or Curie point, is the temperature above which certain materials lose their permanent magnetic properties, which can (in most cases) be replaced by induced magnetism. The Curie temperature is named after Pierre Curie, who showed that magnetism was lost at a critical temperature.[1]","image":"Diagram_of_Ferromagnetic_Magnetic_Moments.png.webp"}
