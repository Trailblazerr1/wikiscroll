{"title":"Abou Diaby","summary":"Vassiriki Abou Diaby (born 11 May 1986), known as Abou Diaby, is a French former professional footballer. He played primarily in a box to box role, adept at both attacking and defending. Described as a player who was \"languid, elusive, and athletic\" that could either \"dribble past opponents or slip passes to team-mates\".[4] Of Ivorian descent, Diaby also possessed \"superb touch\" and \"excellent close control\". Diaby's career was hampered by numerous repetitive injuries, a problem that existed from his time in France.[4][5] His physical appearance and positional preference evoked comparisons to Arsenal legend and compatriot Patrick Vieira.[6][7]","image":"Abou_Diaby_Arsenal_vs_Birmingham_2010-11.jpg.webp","url":"Abou_Diaby"}
