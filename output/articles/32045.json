{"title":"Nicotine","summary":"Nicotine is a naturally produced alkaloid in the nightshade family of plants (most predominantly in tobacco and Duboisia hopwoodii)[6] and is widely used recreationally as a stimulant and anxiolytic. As a pharmaceutical drug, it is used for smoking cessation to relieve withdrawal symptoms.[7][4][8][9] Nicotine acts as a receptor agonist at most nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs),[10][11][12] except at two nicotinic receptor subunits (nAChRα9 and nAChRα10) where it acts as a receptor antagonist.[10]","image":"Nicotine.svg.png.webp"}
