{"title":"Animal Liberation Front","summary":"The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) is an international, leaderless, decentralized political and social resistance movement that engages in and promotes non-violent direct action in protest against incidents of animal cruelty. It originated in the 1970s from the Bands of Mercy. Participants state it is a modern-day Underground Railroad, removing animals from laboratories and farms, destroying facilities, arranging safe houses, veterinary care and operating sanctuaries where the animals subsequently live.[1][2][3][4] Critics have labelled them as terrorists.[5][6][7][8]","image":"ALF_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Animal_Liberation_Front"}
