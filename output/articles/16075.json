{"title":"Fibonacci heap","summary":"In computer science, a Fibonacci heap is a data structure for priority queue operations, consisting of a collection of  heap-ordered trees. It has a better amortized running time than many other priority queue data structures including the binary heap and binomial heap. Michael L. Fredman and Robert E. Tarjan developed Fibonacci heaps in 1984 and published them in a scientific journal in 1987. Fibonacci heaps are named after the Fibonacci numbers, which are used in their running time analysis.","image":"Fibonacci_heap.png.webp"}
