{"title":"American literature","summary":"American literature is literature predominantly written or produced in English[1][2] in the United States of America and its preceding colonies. Before the founding of the United States, the Thirteen Colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States were heavily influenced by British literature. The American literary tradition thus is part of the broader tradition of English-language literature. A small amount of literature exists in other immigrant languages. Furthermore a rich tradition of oral storytelling exists amongst Native American tribes.[3]","image":"LOC_Main_Reading_Room_Highsmith.jpg.webp","url":"American_literature"}
