{"title":"Abaddon","summary":"The Hebrew term Abaddon (Hebrew: אֲבַדּוֹן‎ Avaddon, meaning \"destruction\", \"doom\"), and its Greek equivalent Apollyon (Koinē Greek: Ἀπολλύων, Apollúōn meaning \"Destroyer\") appear in the Bible as both a place of destruction and an archangel of the abyss. In the Hebrew Bible, abaddon is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place Sheol (שְׁאוֹל Šəʾōl), meaning the realm of the dead.","image":"Christianandapollyon.jpg.webp"}
