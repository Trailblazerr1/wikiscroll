{"title":"1976 Tangshan earthquake","summary":"The 1976 Tangshan earthquake (Chinese: 唐山大地震; pinyin: Tángshān dà dìzhèn; lit. 'Great Tangshan earthquake'), also known as the Great Tangshan earthquake,[8] was a natural disaster resulting from a magnitude 7.6 earthquake that hit the region around Tangshan, Hebei, People's Republic of China on 28 July 1976, at 3:42 in the morning. The maximum intensity of the earthquake was XI (Extreme) on the Mercalli scale. In minutes, eighty-five percent of the buildings in Tangshan collapsed or were unusable, all services failed, and most of the highway and railway bridges collapsed or were seriously damaged.[9]  between 242,000 to 655,000  people died (some have said three times that), making this one of the deadliest earthquakes in recorded history.[10] The lack of warning and foreshocks, in contrast to the earlier 1975 Haicheng earthquake, was a principal factor in the large number of casualties.","image":"1976_Tangshan.png.webp"}
