{"title":"Wikinews","summary":"Wikinews is a free-content news wiki and a project of the Wikimedia Foundation. The site works through collaborative journalism. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has distinguished Wikinews from Wikipedia by saying \"on Wikinews, each story is to be written as a news story as opposed to an encyclopedia article.\"[2]  The neutral point of view policy that Wikinews claim to have, has an aim to distinguish it from other citizen journalism efforts such as Indymedia and OhmyNews.[3]  In contrast to most projects of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikinews allows original work under the form of original reporting and interviews.[4]","image":"WikiNews-Logo-en.svg.png.webp"}
