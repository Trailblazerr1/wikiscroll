{"title":"Internet Watch Foundation and Wikipedia","summary":"On 5 December 2008, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a British watchdog group, blacklisted content on the English Wikipedia related to Scorpions' 1976 studio album Virgin Killer, due to the presence of its controversial cover artwork, depicting a young girl posing nude, with a faux shattered-glass effect obscuring her genitalia. The image was deemed to be \"potentially illegal content\" under English law which forbids the possession or creation of indecent photographs of children. The IWF's blacklist are used in web filtering systems such as Cleanfeed.","image":"Virgin_Killer.jpg.webp","url":"Internet_Watch_Foundation_and_Wikipedia"}
