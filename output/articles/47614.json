{"title":"Visual perception","summary":"Visual perception is the ability to interpret the surrounding environment through color vision, scotopic vision, and mesopic vision, using light in the visible spectrum reflected by the objects in the environment. This is different from visual acuity, which refers to how clearly a person sees (for example \"20/20 vision\"). A person can have problems with visual perceptual processing even if they have 20/20 vision.","image":"Psi2.svg.png.webp","url":"Visual_perception"}
