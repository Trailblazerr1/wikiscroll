{"title":"Shulchan Aruch","summary":"The Shulchan Aruch (Hebrew: שֻׁלְחָן עָרוּך‎ [ʃulˈħan ʕaˈrux], literally: \"Set Table\"),[1] sometimes dubbed in English as the Code of Jewish Law, is the most widely consulted of the various legal codes in Judaism. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Joseph Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later.[2] Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written.","image":"Brockhaus_and_Efron_Jewish_Encyclopedia_e9_327-0.jpg.webp"}
