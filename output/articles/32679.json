{"title":"Occupation of Japan","summary":"The Allied Occupation of Japan (連合国占領下の日本, Rengōkoku senryō-ka no Nihon) was a military occupation of Japan in the years immediately following Japan's defeat in World War II. Led by the United States with the support of the British Commonwealth and the supervision of the Far Eastern Commission, the occupation lasted from 1945 to 1952 and involved a total of nearly 1 million Allied soldiers.[1] The occupation was overseen by American general Douglas MacArthur, who was appointed Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers by US President Harry Truman; MacArthur was succeeded as Supreme Commander by General Matthew Ridgway in 1951. Unlike in the occupation of Germany, the Soviet Union had little to no influence over the occupation of Japan, declining to participate because it did not want to place Soviet troops under MacArthur's direct command.[2]","image":"Flag_of_Allied_Occupied_Japan.svg.png.webp"}
