{"title":"2009 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans","summary":"An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of a specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific \"All-America\" and typically referred to as \"All-American athletes\", or simply \"All-Americans\".  Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media.  Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.[1]  The 2009 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that includes All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the Sporting News (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) drawn from the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.  All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC, AP and TSN choose third teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.","image":"Stephen_Curry_Davidson_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"2009_NCAA_Men's_Basketball_All-Americans"}
