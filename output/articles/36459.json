{"title":"Public company","summary":"A public company, publicly traded company, publicly held company, publicly listed company, or public limited company is a company whose ownership is organized via shares of stock which are intended to be freely traded on a stock exchange or in over-the-counter markets. A public company can be listed on a stock exchange (listed company), which facilitates the trade of shares, or not (unlisted public company). In some jurisdictions, public companies over a certain size must be listed on an exchange. In most cases, public companies are private enterprises in the private sector, and \"public\" emphasizes their reporting and trading on the public markets.","image":"New_York_Stock_Exchange_Facade_2015.jpg.webp","url":"Public_company"}
