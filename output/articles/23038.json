{"title":"Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō","summary":"Hōshō (鳳翔, literally \"phoenix flying\") was the world's first commissioned ship that was built as an aircraft carrier,[Note 1] and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hōshō's superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews.","image":"Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hōshō_Tokyo_Bay.jpg.webp","url":"Japanese_aircraft_carrier_Hōshō"}
