{"title":"Official Irish Republican Army","summary":"The Official Irish Republican Army or Official IRA (OIRA; Irish: Óglaigh na hÉireann) was an Irish republican paramilitary group whose goal was to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a \"workers' republic\" encompassing all of Ireland.[1] It emerged in December 1969, shortly after the beginning of the Troubles, when the Irish Republican Army (IRA) split into two factions. The other was the Provisional IRA. Each continued to call itself simply \"the IRA\" and rejected the other's legitimacy. Unlike the \"Provisionals\", the \"Officials\" did not think that Ireland could be unified until the Protestant majority of Northern Ireland and Catholic minority of Northern Ireland were at peace with each other. The Officials were Marxist-Leninists and worked to form a united front with other Irish communist groups, named the Irish National Liberation Front (NLF).[2] The Officials were called the NLF by the Provisionals,[3][4] the \"stickies\" by West Belfast locals (in reference to members who would glue Easter lilies to their uniforms),[5]  and were sometimes nicknamed the Red IRA by others.[6][7][8]","image":"OfficialIRA1972.jpg.webp"}
