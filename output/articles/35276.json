{"title":"Plymouth Brethren","summary":"The Plymouth Brethren or Assemblies of brethren are a low church, non-conformist, Non-denominational Christian movement whose history can be traced back to Dublin, Ireland, in the late 1820s, where they originated from Anglicanism.[1][2] The group emphasizes sola scriptura, the belief that the Bible is the supreme authority for church doctrine and practice, over and above any other source of authority. Plymouth Brethren generally see themselves as a network of like-minded free churches, not as a Christian denomination.","image":"Plym.jpg.webp","url":"Plymouth_Brethren"}
