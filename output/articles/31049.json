{"title":"Myth of the clean Wehrmacht","summary":"The myth of the clean Wehrmacht is the negationist notion that the regular German armed forces (the Wehrmacht) were not involved in the Holocaust or other war crimes during World War II. The debunked myth, heavily promoted by German authors and military personnel after World War II,[2] completely denies the culpability of the German military command in the planning and preparation of war crimes. Even where the perpetration of war crimes and the waging of an extermination campaign, particularly in the Soviet Union – where the Nazis viewed the population as \"sub-humans\" ruled by \"Jewish Bolshevik\" conspirators – has been acknowledged, they are ascribed to the \"Party soldiers\", the Schutzstaffel (SS), but not the regular German military.","image":"Neonaziaufmarsch_in_Muenchen.jpg.webp","url":"Myth_of_the_clean_Wehrmacht"}
