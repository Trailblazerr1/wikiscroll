{"title":"Epigenetics","summary":"In biology, epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotype changes that do not involve alterations in the DNA sequence.[1] The Greek prefix epi- (ἐπι- \"over, outside of, around\") in epigenetics implies features that are \"on top of\" or \"in addition to\" the traditional genetic basis for inheritance.[2] Epigenetics most often involves changes that affect gene activity and expression, but the term can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change. Such effects on cellular and physiological phenotypic traits may result from external or environmental factors, or be part of normal development.","image":"Epigenetic_mechanisms.png.webp","url":"Epigenetics"}
