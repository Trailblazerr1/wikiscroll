{"title":"Joseph (Genesis)","summary":"Joseph (/ˈdʒoʊzəf, -səf/; Hebrew: יוֹסֵף‎, lit. 'he will add';[1] Standard: Yōsef, Tiberian: Yōsēp̄; Arabic: يوسف‎, romanized: Yūsuf, Yūsef; Ancient Greek: Ἰωσήφ, romanized: Iōsēph) is an important figure in the Bible's Book of Genesis. His function is to explain how Israel came to Egypt. He is the favourite son of the patriarch Jacob, and his jealous brothers sell him into slavery in Egypt, where he eventually ends up incarcerated; after correctly interpreting the dreams of Pharaoh, however, he rises to second in command in Egypt and saves Egypt during a famine. Jacob's family travel to Egypt to escape the famine, and it is through him that they are given leave to settle in the Land of Goshen (the eastern part of the Nile Delta).","image":"Bourgeois_Joseph_recognized_by_his_brothers.jpg.webp","url":"Joseph_(Genesis)"}
