{"title":"Relative permittivity","summary":"The dielectric constant (or relative permittivity) is the electric permeability of a material expressed as a ratio with the electric permeability of a vacuum. A dielectric is an insulating material, and the dielectric constant of an insulator measures the ability of the insulator to store electric energy in an electrical field.","image":"Water_relative_static_permittivity.svg.png.webp"}
