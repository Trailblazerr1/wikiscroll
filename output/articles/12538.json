{"title":"Demersal fish","summary":"Demersal fish, also known as groundfish, live and feed on or near the bottom of seas or lakes (the demersal zone).[1] They occupy the sea floors and lake beds, which usually consist of mud, sand, gravel or rocks.[1] In coastal waters they are found on or near the continental shelf, and in deep waters they are found on or near the continental slope or along the continental rise. They are not generally found in the deepest waters, such as abyssal depths or on the abyssal plain, but they can be found around seamounts and islands. The word demersal comes from the Latin demergere, which means to sink.","image":"Stingray.jpg.webp"}
