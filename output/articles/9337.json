{"title":"Charles Manson","summary":"Charles Milles Manson (né Maddox; November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California, in the late 1960s. Some of the members committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.[2]","image":"Manson1968.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_Manson"}
