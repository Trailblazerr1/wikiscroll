{"title":"iPhone 4","summary":"The iPhone 4 is a smartphone that was designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It is the fourth generation of the iPhone lineup, succeeding the iPhone 3GS and preceding the 4S. Following a number of notable leaks, the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7, 2010, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco,[8] and was released on June 24, 2010, in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan. The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family, which Apple's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time; it consisted of a stainless steel frame which doubled as an antenna, with internal components situated between two panels of aluminosilicate glass.[9] The iPhone 4 introduced Apple's new high-resolution \"Retina Display\" (with a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch), while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors, Apple's A4 system-on-chip, along with iOS 4â€”which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple's new FaceTime video chat service. It was the first iPhone at the time to include a front-facing camera, and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks, ending AT&T's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States.","image":"IPhone_4_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"IPhone_4"}
