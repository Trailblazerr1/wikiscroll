He was the third and most recent president from the Agrarian League/Centre Party. As head of state for nearly 26 years, he dominated Finnish politics, held a large amount of power, won his later elections with little opposition and has often been classified as an autocrat.[1] Nevertheless, he remains a respected figure.","image":"Urho-Kekkonen-1977-c.jpg.webp","url":"Urho_Kekkonen"}
