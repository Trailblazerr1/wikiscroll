{"title":"First observation of gravitational waves","summary":"The first direct observation of gravitational waves was made on 14 September 2015 and was announced by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations on 11 February 2016.[3][4][5] Previously, gravitational waves had been inferred only indirectly, via their effect on the timing of pulsars in binary star systems.  The waveform, detected by both LIGO observatories,[6] matched the predictions of general relativity[7][8][9] for a gravitational wave emanating from the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes of around 36 and 29 solar masses and the subsequent \"ringdown\" of the single resulting black hole.[note 2] The signal was named GW150914 (from \"Gravitational Wave\" and the date of observation 2015-09-14).[3][11] It was also the first observation of a binary black hole merger, demonstrating both the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the fact that such mergers could occur within the current age of the universe.","image":"LIGO_measurement_of_gravitational_waves.svg.png.webp","url":"First_observation_of_gravitational_waves"}
