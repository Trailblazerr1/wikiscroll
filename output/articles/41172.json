{"title":"Socialist market economy","summary":"The socialist market economy (SME) is the economic system and model of economic development employed in the People's Republic of China. The system is based on the predominance of public ownership and state-owned enterprises within a market economy.[1] The term \"socialist market economy\" was introduced by Jiang Zemin during the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992 to describe the goal of China's economic reforms.[2] Originating in the Chinese economic reforms initiated in 1978 that integrated China into the global market economy, the socialist market economy represents a preliminary or \"primary stage\" of developing socialism.[3] Many commentators describe the system as a form of state capitalism.[4][5][6]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Socialist_market_economy"}
