{"title":"Uzair","summary":"Uzair (Arabic: عزير‎, ʿUzayr) is a figure who is mentioned in the Quran, Surah At-Tawba, verse 9:30, which states that he was revered by the Jews as \"the son of God\". Uzair is most often identified with the biblical Ezra. Modern historians have described the reference as \"enigmatic\", since such views have not been found in Jewish sources.[1][2] Islamic scholars have interpreted the Quranic reference in different ways, with some explaining that it alluded to a specific group of Jews.[1]","image":"Prophet_Uzair_Name.svg.png.webp"}
