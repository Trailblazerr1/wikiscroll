{"title":"Riemannian manifold","summary":"In differential geometry, a Riemannian manifold or Riemannian space (M, g) is a real, smooth manifold M equipped with a positive-definite inner product gp on the tangent space TpM at each point p. A common convention is to take g to be smooth, which means that for any smooth coordinate chart (U, x) on M, the n2 functions","image":"1dbcfa0313badb0b252ba03655607ac92e6d66a7.svg","url":"Riemannian_manifold"}
