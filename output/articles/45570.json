{"title":"Tory","summary":"A Tory (/ˈtɔːri/) is a person who holds a political philosophy known as Toryism, based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism, which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved in the English culture throughout history. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase \"God, Queen, and Country\".[1] Tories are generally monarchists, were historically of a high church Anglican religious heritage,[2][3] and opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction. Typically, Tories defend the ideas of hierarchy, natural order, and aristocracy.","image":"Royal_Oak.png.webp"}
