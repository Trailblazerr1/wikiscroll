{"title":"Electronic cigarette","summary":"An electronic cigarette[notes 1][1] is an electronic device that simulates tobacco smoking.  It consists of an  atomizer, a power source such as a battery, and a container such as a cartridge or tank.  Instead of smoke, the user inhales vapor.[2] As such, using an e-cigarette is often called \"vaping\".[3] The atomizer is a heating element that atomizes a liquid solution called e-liquid.[4] E-cigarettes are activated by taking a puff or pressing a button.[3][5] Some look like traditional cigarettes,[3][6] and most versions are reusable.[7]","image":"Electronic_Cigarette_and_USB_Charger_(14939561277)_(retouched).jpg.webp","url":"Electronic_cigarette"}
