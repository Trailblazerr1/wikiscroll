{"title":"National Rugby League","summary":"The National Rugby League (NRL), formed in 1998, is the pre-eminent rugby league club competition in Australia and New Zealand. It contains some clubs from the original Sydney club Rugby League competition, which had been running continuously since 1908. A single team from New Zealand also plays in the league. The NRL formed in the aftermath of the 1990s' Super League war as a joint partnership between the Australian Rugby League (ARL) and media giant News Corporation-controlled Super League,[3] after both organisations ran premierships parallel to each other in 1997.[4] This partnership was dissolved in February 2012, with control of the NRL going solely to the re-constituted ARL which was re-structured with an independent board of directors and renamed as the Australian Rugby League Commission.","image":"Rugby_football_current_event.svg.png.webp","url":"National_Rugby_League"}
