{"title":"21-Hydroxylase","summary":"Steroid 21-hydroxylase (steroid 21-monooxygenase, cytochrome P450c21, 21α-hydroxylase, less commonly 21β-hydroxylase, etc.) is an enzyme that hydroxylates steroids at the C21 position[9][10] and is involved in biosynthesis of aldosterone and cortisol. The enzyme converts progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone into 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively,[11][12] within metabolic pathways that ultimately lead to aldosterone and cortisol. Deficiency in the enzyme may cause congenital adrenal hyperplasia.","image":"Full_Structure_of_21-Hydroxylase.png.webp","url":"21-Hydroxylase"}
