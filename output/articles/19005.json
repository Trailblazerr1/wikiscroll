{"title":"Grignard reaction","summary":"The Grignard reaction (French: [ɡʁiɲaʁ]) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl, allyl, vinyl, or aryl-magnesium halides (Grignard reagent) is added to a carbonyl group in an aldehyde or ketone.[1][2]  This reaction is important for the formation of carbon–carbon bonds.[3][4] The reaction of an organic halide with magnesium is not a Grignard reaction, but provides a Grignard reagent.[5]","image":"Grignard_reaction_experiment_07.jpg.webp"}
