{"title":"Sailing ship","summary":"A sailing ship is a sea-going vessel that uses sails mounted on masts to harness the power of wind and propel the vessel. There is a variety of sail plans that propel sailing ships, employing square-rigged or fore-and-aft sails. Some ships carry square sails on each mastâ€”the brig and full-rigged ship, said to be \"ship-rigged\" when there are three or more masts.[1] Others carry only fore-and-aft sails on each mast, for instance some schooners. Still others employ a combination of square and fore-and-aft sails, including the barque, barquentine, and brigantine.[2]","image":"John_C._Munro_off_Hong_Kong.jpg.webp"}
