{"title":"Telomerase","summary":"Telomerase, also called terminal transferase,[1] is a ribonucleoprotein that adds a species-dependent telomere repeat sequence to the 3' end of telomeres. A telomere is a region of repetitive sequences at each end of the chromosomes of most eukaryotes. Telomeres protect the end of the chromosome from DNA damage or from fusion with neighbouring chromosomes. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster lacks telomerase, but instead uses retrotransposons to maintain telomeres.[2]","image":"Tibolium_castaneum_TERT_structure.png.webp","url":"Telomerase"}
