{"title":"Under the Bridge","summary":"\"Under the Bridge\" is a song by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It is the eleventh track on the group's fifth studio album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and was released as its second single on March 10, 1992. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis wrote the lyrics to express feelings of loneliness and despondency, and to reflect on narcotics and their impact on his life. Kiedis was driving home from rehearsals when Blood Sugar Sex Magik was in pre-production and said he sang the lyrics to himself. Kiedis initially did not feel that \"Under the Bridge\" would fit into the Chili Peppers' repertoire, and was reluctant to show it to his bandmates until producer Rick Rubin implored him to do so. The rest of the band was receptive to the lyrics and wrote the music.","image":"UndertheBridge.jpg.webp"}
