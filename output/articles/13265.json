{"title":"Docking station","summary":"In computing, a docking station or port replicator (hub) or dock provides a simplified way of \"plugging-in\" a laptop computer to common peripherals. Because a wide range of dockable devices—from mobile telephones to wireless mice—have different connectors, power signaling, and uses, docks are not standardized and are therefore often designed with a specific type of device in mind. This technology is also used on the Nintendo Switch hybrid video game console.","image":"Docking_station_1.jpg.webp"}
