A remake of the eponymous 1990 film of the same name directed by Mukul S. Anand, it centers on a screenplay written by Malhotra and Ila Dutta Bedi on the basis of an altered version of the original story by Santosh Saroj, while the dialogues are written by Piyush Mishra. Johar pays tribute to his father, Yash Johar, the producer of the original, through the film.[4] The music of the film was composed by Ajay-Atul, with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. As with the original, the title is taken from a poem of the same name by Harivansh Rai Bachchan, which forms a thematic link through the film, both literally and metaphorically.[5]","image":"Agneepath_poster.jpg.webp"}
