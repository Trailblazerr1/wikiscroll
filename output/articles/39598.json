{"title":"Schenectady, New York","summary":"Schenectady  (/skəˈnɛktədi/[3][4]) is a city in Schenectady County, New York, United States, of which it is the county seat. As of the 2010 census, the city's population of 66,135 made it the state's ninth-largest city by population. The name \"Schenectady\" is derived from the Mohawk word skahnéhtati, meaning \"beyond the pines\".[5] Schenectady was founded on the south side of the Mohawk River by Dutch colonists in the 17th century, many of which were from the Albany area. The Dutch transferred the name \"Skahnéhtati\" which is in reality the Mohawk name for Albany, New York. These Dutch were prohibited from the fur trade by the Albany monopoly, which kept its control after the English takeover in 1664. Residents of the new village developed farms on strip plots along the river.","image":"Nott_Memorial_Hall%2C_Union_College%2C_Schenectady%2C_NY.jpg.webp"}
