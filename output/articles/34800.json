{"title":"Philippine–American War","summary":"The Philippine–American War[10] or the Filipino–American War (modern Filipino: Digmaang Pilipino–Amerikano), previously referred to as the Philippine Insurrection or the Tagalog Insurgency by the United States,[11][12][13] was an armed conflict between the First Philippine Republic and the United States that lasted from February 4, 1899, to July 2, 1902.[14] While Filipino nationalists viewed the conflict as a continuation of the struggle for independence that began in 1896 with the Philippine Revolution against Spain, the U.S. government regarded it as an insurrection.[15] The conflict arose when the First Philippine Republic objected to the terms of the Treaty of Paris under which the United States took possession of the Philippines from Spain, ending the Spanish–American War.[16]","image":"Manila646_1899.jpg.webp","url":"Philippine–American_War"}
