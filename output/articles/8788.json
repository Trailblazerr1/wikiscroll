{"title":"Cascadia subduction zone","summary":"The Cascadia subduction zone  is a convergent plate boundary that stretches from northern Vancouver Island in Canada to Northern California in the United States.  It is a very long, sloping subduction zone where the Explorer, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda plates move to the east and slide below the much larger mostly continental North American Plate. The zone varies in width and lies offshore beginning near Cape Mendocino, Northern California, passing through Oregon and Washington, and terminating at about Vancouver Island in British Columbia.[1]","image":"Cascadia_Subduction_Zone.jpg.webp"}
