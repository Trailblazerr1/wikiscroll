{"title":"Île-de-France","summary":"The Île-de-France (/ˌiːl də ˈfrɒ̃s/, French: [il də fʁɑ̃s] (listen); literally \"Isle of France\") is the most populous of the eighteen regions of France. Centred on the capital Paris, it is located in the north-central part of the country and often called the Région Parisienne (pronounced [ʁeʒjɔ̃ paʁizjɛn]; English: Paris Region). Île-de-France is densely populated and retains a prime economic position on the national stage: though it covers only 12,012 square kilometres (4,638 square miles), about 2% of metropolitan French territory, its estimated 2020 population of 12,278,210 was nearly one-fifth of the national total; its economy accounts for nearly one-third of the French gross domestic product.[2]","image":"Eiffel_Tower_from_the_Tour_Montparnasse_3%2C_Paris_May_2014.jpg.webp","url":"Île-de-France"}
