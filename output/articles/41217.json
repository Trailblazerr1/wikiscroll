{"title":"Softball","summary":"Softball is a game similar to baseball played with a larger ball (11 to 16 inches or 28 to 40 cm circumference) on a field that has base lengths of 60 feet, a pitcher's mound that ranges from 35 to 43 (professional is 43)  feet away from home plate, and a home run fence that is 220â€“300 feet away from home plate, depending on the type of softball being played.[1][2] It was invented in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, United States as an indoor game.[3] The game moves at a faster pace than traditional baseball due to the field being smaller and the bases and the fielders being closer to home plate. There is less time for the base runner to get to first while the opponent fields the ball; yet, the fielder has less time to field the ball while the opponent is running down to first base.","image":"Australia_v_Japan_Game_7_034.JPG.webp","url":"Softball"}
