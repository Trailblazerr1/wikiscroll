{"title":"Russian Civil War","summary":"The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражданская война в России, tr. Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossii; 7 November 1917 – 16 June 1923)[1] was a multi-party civil war in the former Russian Empire sparked by the overthrowing of the monarchy and a new republican government's failure to maintain stability, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future, resulting in the formation of the communist Soviet Union on most of its territory. Its finale marked the end of the Russian Revolution, which was one of the key events of the 20th-century.","image":"Russian_Civil_War_montage.png.webp"}
