{"title":"Astronomical coordinate systems","summary":"Astronomical coordinate systems are organized arrangements for specifying positions of satellites, planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects relative to physical reference points available to a situated observer (e.g. the true horizon and north cardinal direction to an observer situated on the Earth's surface).[1] Coordinate systems in astronomy can specify an object's position in three-dimensional space or plot merely its direction on a celestial sphere, if the object's distance is unknown or trivial.","image":"Ecliptic_equator_galactic_anim.gif","url":"Astronomical_coordinate_systems"}
