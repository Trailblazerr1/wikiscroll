{"title":"Free verse","summary":"Free verse is an open form of poetry, which in its modern form arose through the French vers libre form. It does not use consistent meter patterns, rhyme, or any musical pattern.[1] It thus tends to follow the rhythm of natural speech.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
