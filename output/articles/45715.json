{"title":"Tragedy of the commons","summary":"In economic science, the tragedy of the commons is a situation in which individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use,[1][2] act independently according to their own self-interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action.[3] The concept originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd,[4] who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a \"common\") in Great Britain and Ireland.[5] The concept became widely known as the \"tragedy of the commons\" over a century later after an article written by Garrett Hardin in 1968.[6]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Tragedy_of_the_commons"}
