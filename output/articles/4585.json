{"title":"Ascus","summary":"An ascus (plural asci; from Greek ἀσκός ảskós 'skin bag'[1]) is the sexual spore-bearing cell produced in ascomycete fungi.  Each ascus usually contains eight ascospores (or octad), produced by meiosis followed, in most species, by a mitotic cell division.  However, asci in some genera or species can occur in numbers of one (e.g. Monosporascus cannonballus), two, four, or multiples of four. In a few cases, the ascospores can bud off conidia that may fill the asci (e.g. Tympanis) with hundreds of conidia, or the ascospores may fragment, e.g. some Cordyceps, also filling the asci with smaller cells. Ascospores are nonmotile, usually single celled, but not infrequently may be coenocytic (lacking a septum), and in some cases coenocytic in multiple planes. Mitotic divisions within the developing spores populate each resulting cell in septate ascospores with nuclei. The term ocular chamber, or oculus,  refers to the epiplasm (the portion of cytoplasm not used in ascospore formation) that is surrounded by the \"bourrelet\" (the thickened tissue near the top of the ascus).[2]","image":"Morelasci.jpg.webp","url":"Ascus"}
