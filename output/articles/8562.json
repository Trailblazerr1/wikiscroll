{"title":"Carbon sequestration","summary":"Carbon sequestration is the process of storing carbon in a carbon pool.[2]: AVII-54  Carbon dioxide (CO2) is naturally captured from the atmosphere through biological, chemical, and physical processes.[3] These changes can be accelerated through changes in land use and agricultural practices, such as converting crop and livestock grazing land into land for non-crop fast growing plants.[4] Artificial processes have been devised to produce similar effects,[3] including large-scale, artificial capture and sequestration of industrially produced CO2 using subsurface saline aquifers, reservoirs, ocean water, aging oil fields, or other carbon sinks, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, ocean fertilization, enhanced weathering, and direct air capture when combined with storage.[5][6]","image":"Carbon_sequestration-2009-10-07.svg.png.webp"}
