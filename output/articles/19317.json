{"title":"HPV vaccine","summary":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are vaccines that prevent infection by certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV).[2] Available HPV vaccines protect against either two, four, or nine types of HPV.[2][3] All HPV vaccines protect against at least HPV types 16 and 18, which cause the greatest risk of cervical cancer.[2] It is estimated that HPV vaccines may prevent 70% of cervical cancer, 80% of anal cancer, 60% of vaginal cancer, 40% of vulvar cancer, and show more than 90% efficacy in preventing HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers.[4][5][6][7] They additionally prevent some genital warts, with the quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines that protect against HPV types HPV-6 and HPV-11 providing greater protection.[2]","image":"Gardasil_vaccine_and_box_new.jpg.webp","url":"HPV_vaccine"}
