{"title":"Periodontal disease","summary":"Periodontal disease, also known as gum disease, is a set of inflammatory conditions affecting the tissues surrounding the teeth.[4] In its early stage, called gingivitis, the gums become swollen, red, and may bleed.[4] It is considered the main cause of tooth loss for adults worldwide.[6][7] In its more serious form, called periodontitis, the gums can pull away from the tooth, bone can be lost, and the teeth may loosen or fall out.[4] Bad breath may also occur.[1]","image":"Paro1.JPG.webp"}
