{"title":"Zinfandel","summary":"Zinfandel (also known as Primitivo) is a variety of black-skinned wine grape. The variety is grown in over 10 percent of California vineyards.[1] DNA analysis has revealed that it is genetically equivalent to the Croatian grapes Crljenak Ka≈°telanski and Tribidrag, as well as to the Primitivo variety traditionally grown in Apulia (the \"heel\" of Italy), where it was introduced in the 18th century.[2] The grape found its way to the United States in the mid-19th century, where it became known by variations of a name applied to a different grape, likely \"Zierfandler\" from Austria.","image":"Ripe_Zinfandel_grapes_in_Dry_Creek_Valley-8958.jpg.webp","url":"Zinfandel"}
