{"title":"Buddhist texts","summary":"Buddhist texts are those religious texts which belong to the Buddhist tradition. The earliest Buddhist texts  were not committed to writing until  some centuries after the death of Gautama Buddha.[1]  The oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, found in Afghanistan and written in Gāndhārī, they date from the first century BCE to the third century CE.[2]    The first Buddhist texts were initially passed on orally by Buddhist monastics, but were later written down and composed as manuscripts in various Indo-Aryan languages (such as Pāli, Gāndhārī, and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit) and collected into various Buddhist Canons.[3] These were then translated into other languages such as Buddhist Chinese (fójiào hànyǔ 佛教漢語) and Classical Tibetan as Buddhism spread outside of India.[3]","image":"Illustrated_Sinhalese_covers_(inside)_showing_the_events_Wellcome_L0031774.jpg.webp"}
