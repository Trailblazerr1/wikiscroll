{"title":"Antifeminism","summary":"Antifeminism, also spelled anti-feminism, is opposition to some or all forms of feminism. In the late 19th century and early 20th century antifeminists opposed particular policy proposals for women's rights, such as the right to vote, educational opportunities, property rights, and access to birth control.[1][2] In the mid and late 20th century antifeminists often opposed the right to abortion and, in the United States, the Equal Rights Amendment. In the early 21st century antifeminism has sometimes been an element of violent, far-right extremist acts.[3][4][5]","image":"Symbol_venus.svg.png.webp","url":"Antifeminism"}
