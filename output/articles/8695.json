{"title":"Carnivore","summary":"A carnivore /ˈkɑːrnɪvɔːr/, meaning \"meat eater\" (Latin, caro, genitive carnis, meaning \"meat\" or \"flesh\" and vorare meaning \"to devour\"), is an animal whose food and energy requirements derive solely from animal products (mainly muscle, fat and other soft tissues) whether through hunting or scavenging.[1][2] Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called hypercarnivores or obligate carnivores, while those that also consume non-animal food are called mesocarnivores or facultative carnivores.[2] Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant vs. animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore.[3] A carnivore at the top of the food chain, not preyed upon by other animals, is termed an apex predator.","image":"Carnivore-lion.jpg.webp","url":"Carnivore"}
