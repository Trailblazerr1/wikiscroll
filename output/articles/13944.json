{"title":"Earl Warren","summary":"Earl Warren (March 19, 1891 â€“ July 9, 1974) was an American politician and jurist who served as 30th governor of California from 1943 to 1953 and as the 14th chief justice of the United States from 1953 to 1969. The \"Warren Court\" presided over a major shift in American constitutional jurisprudence, which has been recognized by many as a \"Constitutional Revolution\" in the liberal direction, with Warren writing the majority opinions in landmark cases such as Brown v. Board of Education (1954), Reynolds v. Sims (1964), Miranda v. Arizona (1966) and Loving v. Virginia (1967). Warren also led the Warren Commission, a presidential commission that investigated the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. He is the last chief justice to have served in an elected office before entering the Supreme Court, and is generally considered to be one of the most influential Supreme Court justices and political leaders in the history of the United States.","image":"Earl_Warren.jpg.webp","url":"Earl_Warren"}
