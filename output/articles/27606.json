{"title":"Lumbar plexus","summary":"The lumbar plexus is a web of nerves (a nervous plexus) in the lumbar region of the body which forms part of the larger lumbosacral plexus.  It is formed by the divisions of the first four lumbar nerves (L1-L4) and from contributions of the subcostal nerve (T12), which is the last thoracic nerve. Additionally, the ventral rami of the fourth lumbar nerve pass communicating branches, the lumbosacral trunk, to the sacral plexus.  The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.[1]","image":"Lumbar_plexus.svg.png.webp","url":"Lumbar_plexus"}
