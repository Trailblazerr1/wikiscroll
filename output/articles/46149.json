{"title":"Tunnel","summary":"A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil/earth/rock and enclosed except for entrance and exit, commonly at each end. A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods.","image":"14-46-35-f-mutzig.jpg.webp"}
