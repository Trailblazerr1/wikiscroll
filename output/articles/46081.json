{"title":"Trust law","summary":"A trust is a legal relationship in which the holder of a right (eg. title to a chattel) gives it to another person or entity who must keep and use it solely for another's benefit. In English common law, the party who entrusts the right is known as the \"settlor\", the party to whom the right is entrusted is known as the \"trustee\", the party for whose benefit the property is entrusted is known as the \"beneficiary\", and the entrusted property itself is known as the \"corpus\" or \"trust property\".[1][2] With the strategic and legal use of Trusts, individuals can ensure that their children and grandchildren or chosen beneficiaries are able to benefit completely from the inheritance they want them to receive.","image":"Shakespeare-Testament.jpg.webp","url":"Trust_law"}
