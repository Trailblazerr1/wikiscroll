{"title":"Al-Andalus","summary":"Al-Andalus[lower-alpha 1] (Arabic: الأَنْدَلُس‎) was the Muslim-ruled area of the Iberian Peninsula. The term is used by modern historians for the former Islamic states based in modern Portugal and Spain.[1] At its greatest geographical extent, its territory occupied most of the peninsula[2] and a part of present-day southern France, Septimania (8th century), and for nearly a century (9th–10th centuries) extended its control from Fraxinet over the Alpine passes which connect Italy to Western Europe.[3][4][5]  The name more specifically describes the different Arab[6] and Muslim[7][8] states that controlled these territories at various times between 711 and 1492, though the boundaries changed constantly as the Christian Reconquista progressed,[7][8][6] eventually shrinking to the south and finally to the vassalage of the Emirate of Granada.","image":"Al-Andalus732.svg.png.webp","url":"Al-Andalus"}
