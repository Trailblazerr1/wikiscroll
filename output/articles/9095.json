{"title":"Central business district","summary":"A central business district (CBD) is the commercial and business center of a city. It contains commercial space and offices. In larger cities, it is often synonymous with the city's \"financial district\". Geographically, it often coincides with the \"city center\" or \"downtown\". However, these concepts are not mutually exclusive: many cities have a central business district located away from its commercial and or cultural center and or downtown/city center, or even several CBDs at once. The CBD is characterized as the area within a city with the highest accessibility plus having a greater variety and concentration of specialized goods and services than any other area.[1]","image":"West_side_of_Manhattan_from_Hudson_Commons_(95103p).jpg.webp"}
