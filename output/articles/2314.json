{"title":"Afforestation","summary":"Afforestation is the establishment of a forest or stand of trees (forestation) in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Many government and non-governmental organizations directly engage in afforestation programs to create forests and increase carbon capture. Afforestation is an increasingly sought-after method to fight climate concerns, as it is known to increase the soil quality and organic carbon levels into the soil, avoiding desertification.","image":"New_afforestation_looking_into_Rand_Wood_-_geograph.org.uk_-_329908.jpg.webp"}
