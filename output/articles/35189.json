{"title":"Plasma (physics)","summary":"Plasma (from Ancient Greek  πλάσμα 'moldable substance')[1] is one of the four fundamental states of matter. It consists of a gas of ions – atoms or molecules which have at least one orbital electron stripped (or an extra electron attached) and, thus, an electric charge.\nIt is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe,[2] being mostly associated with stars,[3] including the Sun.[4][5]\nIt extends to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly to intergalactic regions.[6]","image":"Lightning3.jpg.webp"}
