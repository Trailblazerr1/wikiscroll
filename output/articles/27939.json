{"title":"Madman Muntz","summary":"Earl William \"Madman\" Muntz (January 3, 1914 – June 21, 1987)[1] was an American businessman and engineer who sold and promoted cars and consumer electronics in the United States from the 1930s until his death in 1987. He was a pioneer in television commercials with his oddball \"Madman\" persona – an alter ego who generated publicity with his unusual costumes, stunts, and outrageous claims. Muntz also pioneered car stereos[1] by creating the Muntz Stereo-Pak, better known as the 4-track cartridge, a predecessor to the 8-track cartridge developed by Lear Industries.[2]","image":"Earlmuntz.jpg.webp","url":"Madman_Muntz"}
