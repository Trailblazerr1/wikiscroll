{"title":"Sino-Roman relations","summary":"Han-Roman relations comprised the (mostly indirect) contacts and flows of trade goods, of information, and of occasional travellers between the Roman Empire and the Han Empire of China, as well as between the later Eastern Roman Empire and various  Chinese dynasties. These empires inched progressively closer to each other in the course of the Roman expansion into the ancient Near East and of the simultaneous Han Chinese military incursions into Central Asia. Mutual awareness remained low, and firm knowledge about each other was limited. Surviving records document only a few attempts at direct contact. Intermediate empires such as the  Parthians and  Kushans, seeking to maintain  control over the lucrative silk trade, inhibited direct contact between these two Eurasian powers. In 97 AD the  Chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his envoy Gan Ying to  Rome, but Parthians dissuaded Gan from venturing beyond the Persian Gulf. Ancient Chinese historians recorded several alleged Roman emissaries to China. The first one on record, supposedly either from the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius or from his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, followed by a long hiatus until the first recorded  Byzantine embassy in 643 AD.","image":"RomanandHanEmpiresAD1.png.webp","url":"Sino-Roman_relations"}
