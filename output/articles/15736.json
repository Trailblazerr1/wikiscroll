{"title":"False vacuum decay","summary":"In quantum field theory, a false vacuum[1] is a hypothetical vacuum that is stable, but not in the most stable state possible (it is metastable).[2] It may last for a very long time in that state, but could eventually decay to the more stable state, an event known as false vacuum decay. The most common suggestion of how such a decay might happen in our universe is called bubble nucleation â€“ if a small region of the universe by chance reached a more stable vacuum, this \"bubble\" (also called \"bounce\")[3][4] would spread.","image":"Planck_satellite_cmb.jpg.webp"}
