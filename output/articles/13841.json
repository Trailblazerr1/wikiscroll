{"title":"Dye","summary":"A dye is a colored substance that chemically bonds to the substrate to which it is being applied. This distinguishes dyes from pigments which do not chemically bind to the material they color. Dye is generally applied in an aqueous solution, and may require a mordant to improve the fastness of the dye on the fiber.[2]","image":"Indigo_skeletal.svg.png.webp","url":"Dye"}
