{"title":"Shoegaze","summary":"Shoegaze (originally termed shoegazing and sometimes conflated with \"dream pop\")[10][2] is a subgenre of indie and alternative rock characterized by its ethereal mixture of obscured vocals, guitar distortion and effects, feedback, and overwhelming volume.[1][11] It emerged in Ireland and the United Kingdom in the late 1980s among neo-psychedelic groups[2] who stood motionless during live performances in a detached, non-confrontational state.[1][12] The name comes from the heavy use of effects pedals, as the performers were often looking down at their pedals during concerts.[13]","image":"My_Bloody_Valentine-2.jpg.webp","url":"Shoegaze"}
