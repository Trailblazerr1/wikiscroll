{"title":"Pattern hair loss","summary":"Pattern hair loss is hair loss that primarily affects the top and front of the scalp.[1] In male-pattern hair loss (MPHL), the hair loss typically presents itself as either a receding front hairline, loss of hair on the crown (vertex) of the scalp, or a combination of both. Female-pattern hair loss (FPHL) typically presents as a diffuse thinning of the hair across the entire scalp.[1]","image":"Male-pattern_hair_loss.jpg.webp"}
