{"title":"Queer","summary":"Queer is an umbrella term for people who are not heterosexual or are not cisgender. Originally meaning \"strange\" or \"peculiar\", queer came to be used pejoratively against those with same-sex desires or relationships in the late 19th century. Beginning in the late 1980s, queer activists, such as the members of Queer Nation, began to reclaim the word as a deliberately provocative and politically radical alternative to the more assimilationist branches of the LGBT community.[1][2]","image":"Portal_LGBT.svg.png.webp","url":"Queer"}
