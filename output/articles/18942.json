{"title":"Greensboro sit-ins","summary":"The Greensboro sit-ins were a series of nonviolent protests in February to July 1960, primarily in the Woolworth store—now the International Civil Rights Center and Museum—in Greensboro, North Carolina,[1] which led to the F. W. Woolworth Company department store chain removing its policy of racial segregation in the Southern United States.[2] While not the first sit-in of the civil rights movement, the Greensboro sit-ins were an instrumental action, and also the best-known sit-ins of the civil rights movement. They are considered a catalyst to the subsequent sit-in movement, in which 70,000 people participated.[3][4] This sit-in was a contributing factor in the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC).[5][6]","image":"Greensboro_Four%2C_Feb_1960.jpg.webp","url":"Greensboro_sit-ins"}
