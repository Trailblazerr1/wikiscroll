{"title":"Pleural effusion","summary":"A pleural effusion is accumulation of excessive fluid in the pleural space, the potential space that surrounds each lung. Under normal conditions, pleural fluid is secreted by the parietal pleural capillaries at a rate of 0.01 millilitre per kilogram weight per hour, and is cleared by lymphatic absorption leaving behind only 5â€“15 millilitres of fluid, which helps to maintain a functional vacuum between the parietal and visceral pleurae.  Excess fluid within the pleural space can impair inspiration by upsetting the functional vacuum and hydrostatically increasing the resistance against lung expansion, resulting in a fully or partially collapsed lung.","image":"Diagram_showing_a_build_up_of_fluid_in_the_lining_of_the_lungs_(pleural_effusion)_CRUK_054.svg.png.webp","url":"Pleural_effusion"}
