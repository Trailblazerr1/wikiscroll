{"title":"Dementia","summary":"Dementia manifests as a set of related symptoms, which usually surface when the brain is damaged by injury or disease.[4] The symptoms involve progressive impairments in memory, thinking, and behavior, which negatively impact a person's ability to function and carry out everyday activities. Aside from memory impairment and a disruption in thought patterns, the most common symptoms include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and decreased motivation. The symptoms may be described as occurring in a continuum over several stages.[10][lower-alpha 1] Dementia is not a disorder of consciousness, as that is not usually affected. It ultimately has a significant effect on the individual, caregivers, and relationships in general.[2][3]","image":"A_man_diagnosed_as_suffering_from_acute_dementia._Lithograph_Wellcome_L0026694.jpg.webp"}
