{"title":"Fly","summary":"Flies are insects of the order Diptera, the name being derived from the Greek δι- di- \"two\", and πτερόν pteron \"wing\". Insects of this order use only a single pair of wings to fly, the hindwings having evolved into advanced mechanosensory organs known as halteres, which act as high-speed sensors of rotational movement and allow dipterans to perform advanced aerobatics.[1] Diptera is a large order containing an estimated 1,000,000 species including horse-flies,[lower-alpha 1] crane flies, hoverflies and others, although only about 125,000 species have been described.[4]","image":"Six_Diptera.jpg.webp"}
