{"title":"Teresa of Ávila","summary":"Teresa of Ávila (born Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada; 28 March 1515 – 4 or 15 October 1582[lower-alpha 1]),  also called Saint Teresa of Jesus, was a Spanish noblewoman who was called to convent life in the Catholic Church. A Carmelite nun, prominent Spanish mystic, religious reformer, author, theologian of the contemplative life and of mental prayer, she earned the rare distinction of being declared a Doctor of the Church, but not until over four centuries after her death.[lower-alpha 2] Active during the Catholic Reformation, she reformed the Carmelite Orders of both women and men.[5] The movement she initiated was later joined by the younger Spanish Carmelite friar and mystic John of the Cross. It led eventually to the establishment of the Discalced Carmelites. A formal papal decree adopting the split from the old order was issued in 1580.[6]","image":"Peter_Paul_Rubens_138.jpg.webp","url":"Teresa_of_Ávila"}
