{"title":"Aircraft","summary":"An aircraft is a vehicle or machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil,[1] or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.[2]","image":"Mi-8_(RA-24477)_Helicopter_in_SPB.jpg.webp","url":"Aircraft"}
