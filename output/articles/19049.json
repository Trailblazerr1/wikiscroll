{"title":"Group 12 element","summary":"Group 12, by modern IUPAC numbering,[1] is a group of chemical elements in the periodic table. It includes zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg).[2][3][4] The further inclusion of copernicium (Cn) in group 12 is supported by recent experiments on individual copernicium atoms.[5] Formerly this group was named IIB (pronounced as \"group two B\", as the \"II\" is a Roman numeral) by CAS and old IUPAC system.[note 1]","image":"Zinc_fragment_sublimed_and_1cm3_cube.jpg.webp"}
