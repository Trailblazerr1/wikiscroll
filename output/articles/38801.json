{"title":"Ruta graveolens","summary":"Ruta graveolens [L. strong smelling rue], commonly known as rue, common rue or herb-of-grace, is a species of Ruta grown as an ornamental plant and herb. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is now grown throughout the world in gardens, especially for its bluish leaves, and sometimes for its tolerance of hot and dry soil conditions. It is also cultivated as a medicinal herb (famous in Ethiopia- its local name \"Tena adam\"/Health for Adam), as a condiment, and to a lesser extent as an insect repellent.","image":"Die_Weinraute%2C_lat._Ruta_graveolens%2C_Pflanze_mit_den_gelben_Bl√ºten.jpg.webp","url":"Ruta_graveolens"}
