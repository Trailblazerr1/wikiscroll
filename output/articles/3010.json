{"title":"Alliteration","summary":"In literature, alliteration is the conspicuous repetition of identical initial consonant sounds in successive or closely associated syllables within a group of words, even those spelled differently.[1][2][3][4] As a method of linking words for effect, alliteration is also called head rhyme or initial rhyme.[5] For example, \"humble house\", \"potential power play\",[6] \"picture perfect\", \"money matters\", \"rocky road\", or \"quick question\".[7][8] A familiar example is \"Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers\". \"Alliteration\" is from the Latin word littera, meaning \"letter of the alphabet\"; it was first coined in a Latin dialogue by the Italian humanist Giovanni Pontano in the 15th century.[9] Alliteration is used poetically in various languages around the world, including Arabic, Irish, German, Mongolian, Hungarian, American Sign Language, Somali, Finnish, Icelandic.[10]","image":"Mikado_02_-_Weir_Collection.jpg.webp","url":"Alliteration"}
