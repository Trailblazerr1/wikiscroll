{"title":"Do They Know It's Christmas?","summary":"\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" is a song written in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure in reaction to television reports of the 1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia. It was first recorded in a single day at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London on 25 November 1984 by Band Aid, a supergroup put together by Geldof and Ure and consisting mainly of some of the most popular British and Irish musical acts at the time.[1] The single was released in the United Kingdom on 3 December 1984 and aided by considerable publicity it entered the UK Singles Chart at number one and stayed there for five weeks, becoming the Christmas number one of 1984.[2] It became the fastest selling single in UK chart history, selling a million copies in the first week and passing three million sales on the last day of 1984,[3] on the way to displacing Wings's \"Mull of Kintyre\" as the biggest-selling single of all time in the UK.[4] It held this title until 1997 when it was overtaken by Elton John's \"Candle in the Wind 1997\", released in tribute to Princess Diana following her death.[5] The original version of \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" has sold 3.8 million copies in the UK.[6] In a UK poll in December 2012, it was voted sixth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.[7]","image":"Do_They_Know_It's_Christmas_single_cover_-_1984.jpg.webp"}
