{"title":"Fravashi","summary":"Fravashi (Avestan: 𐬟𐬭𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬀𐬴𐬌 fravaṣ̌i, /frəˈvɑːʃi/) is the Avestan language term for the Zoroastrian concept of a personal spirit of an individual, whether dead, living, or yet-unborn. The fravashi of an individual sends out the urvan (often translated as 'soul') into the material world to fight the battle of good versus evil. On the morning of the fourth day after death, the urvan is imagined to return to its fravashi, where its experiences in the material world are collected to assist the next generation in their fight between good and evil.","image":"Faravahar_neu.svg.png.webp","url":"Fravashi"}
