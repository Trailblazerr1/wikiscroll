{"title":"Silenus","summary":"In Greek mythology, Silenus (/saɪˈliːnəs/; Ancient Greek: Σειληνός, romanized: Seilēnós, IPA: [seːlɛːnós]) was a companion and tutor to the wine god Dionysus. He is typically older than the satyrs of the Dionysian retinue (thiasos), and sometimes considerably older, in which case he may be referred to as a Papposilenus. The plural sileni refers to the mythological figure as a type that is sometimes thought to be differentiated from a satyr by having the attributes of a horse rather than a goat, though usage of the two words is not consistent enough to permit a sharp distinction.\nThe etymology of God Seilenos comes from σείω – shake, move to and fro and ληνός – wine, and meaning \"Shattering, drunken god of wine.\" Undoubtedly, Seilenos presides over other daemones and is related to musical creativity, prophetic ecstasy, drunken joy, drunken dances and gestures.[1]","image":"Sileno_del_100-150_con_testa_di_età_flavia%2C_da_originali_del_primo_ellenismo_della_cerchia_di_lisisppo.JPG.webp"}
