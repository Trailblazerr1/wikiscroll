{"title":"Generations of Noah","summary":"The Generations of Noah or Table of Nations, broadly referred to as Origines Gentium,[1] is a genealogy of the sons of Noah, according to the Hebrew Bible (Genesis 10:9), and their dispersion into many lands after the Flood,[2] focusing on the major known societies. The term nations to describe the descendants is a standard English translation of the Hebrew word \"goyim\", following the c. 400 CE Latin Vulgate's \"nationes\", and does not have the same political connotations that the word entails today.[3]","image":"T_and_O_map_Guntherus_Ziner_1472.jpg.webp","url":"Generations_of_Noah"}
