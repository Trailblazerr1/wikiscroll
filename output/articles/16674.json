{"title":"Forest cobra","summary":"The forest cobra (Naja melanoleuca), also commonly called the black cobra and the black and white-lipped cobra,[4] is a species of venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species is native to Africa, mostly the central and western parts of the continent.[5] It is the largest true cobra species with a record length of 3.2 metres (10 feet).[6][7] Although it prefers lowland forest and moist savanna habitats, this cobra is highly adaptable and can be found in drier climates within its geographical range. It is a very capable swimmer and is often considered to be semi-aquatic.[8] The forest cobra is a generalist in its feeding habits, having a highly varied diet: anything from large insects to small mammals and other reptiles.[4] This species is alert, nervous and is considered to be a very dangerous snake.[8][9] When cornered or molested, it will assume the typical cobra warning posture by raising its fore body off the ground, spreading a narrow hood, and hissing loudly. Bites to humans are less common than from other African cobras due to various factors, though a bite from this species is a life-threatening emergency.[10]","image":"Cobra_des_forÃªts.jpg.webp","url":"Forest_cobra"}
