{"title":"Cavendish experiment","summary":"The Cavendish experiment, performed in 1797â€“1798 by English scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory[1] and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant.[2][3][4] Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth,[5] or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants.","image":"Cavendish_experiment_3.jpg.webp"}
