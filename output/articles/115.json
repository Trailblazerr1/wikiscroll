{"title":"1915 Galveston hurricane","summary":"The 1915 Galveston hurricane was a tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage in the Galveston area in August 1915. Widespread damage was also documented throughout its path across the Caribbean Sea and the interior United States. Due to similarities in strength and trajectory, the storm drew comparisons with the deadly 1900 Galveston hurricane. While the newly completed Galveston Seawall mitigated a similar-scale disaster for Galveston, numerous fatalities occurred along unprotected stretches of the Texas coast due to the storm's 16.2 ft (4.9 m) storm surge. Overall, the major hurricane inflicted at least $30 million in damage and killed 403–405 people.[nb 1] A demographic normalization of landfalling storms suggested that an equivalent storm in 2018 would cause $109.8 billion in damage in the United States.","image":"1915_Galveston_hurricane_isobars_Aug_16_1915_8_p.m._CT.png.webp"}
