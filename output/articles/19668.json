{"title":"Harpy eagle","summary":"The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a neotropical species of eagle. It is also called the American harpy eagle or Brazilian harpy eagle to distinguish it from the Papuan eagle, which is sometimes known as the New Guinea harpy eagle or Papuan harpy eagle.[3] It is the largest and most powerful raptor found throughout its range,[4] and among the largest extant species of eagles in the world. It usually inhabits tropical lowland rainforests in the upper (emergent) canopy layer. Destruction of its natural habitat has caused it to vanish from many parts of its former range, and it is nearly extirpated from much of Central America. In Brazil, the harpy eagle is also known as royal-hawk (in Portuguese: gavi√£o-real).[5] The genus Harpia, together with Harpyopsis and Morphnus form the subfamily Harpiinae.","image":"Harpia_harpyja_001_800.jpg.webp","url":"Harpy_eagle"}
