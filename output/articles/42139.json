{"title":"State religion","summary":"A state religion (also called an established religion or official religion) is a religion or creed officially endorsed by a sovereign state. A state with an official religion, while not secular, is not necessarily a theocracy. State religions are official or government-sanctioned establishments of a religion, but the state does not need to be under the control of the religion (as in a theocracy) nor is the state-sanctioned religion necessarily under the control of the state.","image":"State_Religions.svg.png.webp","url":"State_religion"}
