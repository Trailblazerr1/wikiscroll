{"title":"Fish scale","summary":"A fish scale is a small rigid plate that grows out of the skin of a fish. The skin of most jawed fishes is covered with these protective scales, which can also provide effective camouflage through the use of reflection and colouration, as well as possible hydrodynamic advantages. The term scale derives from the Old French \"escale\", meaning a shell pod or husk.[1]","image":"Fish_scales.jpg.webp"}
