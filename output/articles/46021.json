{"title":"Trophic cascade","summary":"Trophic cascades are powerful indirect interactions that can control entire ecosystems, occurring when a trophic level in a food web is suppressed. For example, a top-down cascade will occur if predators are effective enough in predation to reduce the abundance, or alter the behavior of their prey, thereby releasing the next lower trophic level from predation (or herbivory if the intermediate trophic level is a herbivore).","image":"Kelp_forest_and_sardines%2C_San_Clemente_Island%2C_Channel_Islands%2C_California.jpg.webp","url":"Trophic_cascade"}
