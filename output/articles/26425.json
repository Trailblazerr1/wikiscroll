{"title":"List of FIFA World Cup hat-tricks","summary":"The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition established in 1930. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the FIFA, the sport's global governing body. The tournament has taken place organised every four years, except in 1942 and 1946, when the competition was cancelled due to World War II. A hat-trick occurs when a player scores three or more goals in a single match and it is considered an achievement, especially while playing at the largest international football tournament in the world. Since the first official tournament in 1930 in Uruguay, 52 hat-tricks have been scored in over 800 matches of the 21 editions of the tournament. The first hat-trick was scored by Bert Patenaude of the United States, playing against Paraguay in 1930; the most recent was by Harry Kane of England, playing against Panama on 24 June 2018. The only World Cup not to have at least one hat-trick scored was the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. The record number of hat-tricks in a single World Cup tournament is eight, during the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland.","image":"Gabriel_batistuta.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_hat-tricks"}
