{"title":"2004 Summer Olympics","summary":"The 2004 Summer Olympics (Greek: Θερινοί Ολυμπιακοί Αγώνες 2004, Therinoí Olympiakoí Agónes 2004),[2] officially the Games of the XXVIII Olympiad (Greek: Αγώνες της 28ης Ολυμπιάδας, Agónes tis 28is Olympiádas) and also known as Athens 2004 (Greek: Αθήνα 2004), were an international multi-sport event held from 13 to 29 August 2004 in Athens, Greece. The Games saw 10,625 athletes compete,[3][4] some 600 more than expected, accompanied by 5,501 team officials from 201 countries,[3] with 301 medal events in 28 different sports.[3] The 2004 Games marked the first time since the 1996 Summer Olympics that all countries with a National Olympic Committee were in attendance, and also marked the first time Athens hosted the Games since their first modern incarnation in 1896. Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). A new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens[5] rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.[6]","image":"2004_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"2004_Summer_Olympics"}
