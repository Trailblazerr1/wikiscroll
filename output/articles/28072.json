{"title":"Main Hall (Japanese Buddhism)","summary":"Main hall is the building within a Japanese Buddhist temple compound (garan) which enshrines the main object of veneration.[1] Because the various denominations deliberately use different terms, this single English term translates several Japanese words, among them butsuden, butsu-dō, kondō, konpon-chūdō, and hondō. Hondō is its exact Japanese equivalent, while the others are more specialized words used by particular sects or for edifices having a particular structure.","image":"Tōdai-ji_Kon-dō.jpg.webp"}
