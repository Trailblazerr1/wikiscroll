{"title":"Frost","summary":"Frost is a thin layer of ice on a solid surface, which forms from water vapor in an above-freezing atmosphere coming in contact with a solid surface whose temperature is below freezing,[1][2] and resulting in a phase change from water vapor (a gas) to ice (a solid) as the water vapor reaches the freezing point. In temperate climates, it most commonly appears on surfaces near the ground as fragile white crystals; in cold climates, it occurs in a greater variety of forms.[3] The propagation of crystal formation occurs by the process of nucleation.","image":"Saint-Amant_16_Gel√©e_blanche_2008.jpg.webp"}
