{"title":"Wavelength-division multiplexing","summary":"In fiber-optic communications, wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is a technology which multiplexes a number of optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths (i.e., colors) of laser light.[1] This technique enables bidirectional communications over a single strand of fiber, also called wavelength-division duplexing, as well as multiplication of capacity.[1]","image":"Multiplexing_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Wavelength-division_multiplexing"}
