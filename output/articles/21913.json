{"title":"Inductive reasoning","summary":"Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning in which a body of observations is synthesized to come up with a general principle.[1] Inductive reasoning is distinct from deductive reasoning. If the premises are correct, the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain; in contrast, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, based upon the evidence given.[2]","image":"Argument_terminology_used_in_logic_(en).svg.png.webp"}
