{"title":"Triazolam","summary":"Triazolam, sold under the brand name Halcion among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant tranquilizer of the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) class, which are benzodiazepine (BZD) derivatives.[3] It possesses pharmacological properties similar to those of other benzodiazepines, but it is generally only used as a sedative to treat severe insomnia.[4] In addition to the hypnotic properties, triazolam's amnesic, anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties are pronounced, as well.[5] Due to its short half-life, triazolam is not effective for patients who experience frequent awakenings or early wakening.[6]","image":"Triazolam.svg.png.webp"}
