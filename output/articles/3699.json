{"title":"Anglophile","summary":"An Anglophile is a person who admires or loves England, its people, its culture, its language, and/or its various accents.[1][2] Though \"Anglophilia\" in the strict sense refers to an affinity for England, it is sometimes used to refer to an affinity for the United Kingdom as a whole and can include Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In this case, \"Britophilia\" is the more accurate but rarer term.","image":"Plaque_to_an_anglophile_within_St_George's%2C_Bloomsbury_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1105107.jpg.webp","url":"Anglophile"}
