{"title":"Protest","summary":"A protest (also called a demonstration, remonstration or remonstrance) is a public expression of objection, disapproval or dissent towards an idea or action, typically a political one.[2][3] \nProtests can be thought of as  acts of cooperation in which numerous people cooperate by attending, and share the potential costs and risks of doing so.[4] \nProtests can take many different forms, from individual statements to mass demonstrations. Protesters may organize a protest as a way of publicly making their opinions heard in an attempt to influence public opinion or government policy, or they may undertake direct action in an attempt to enact desired changes themselves.[5] Where protests are part of a systematic and peaceful nonviolent campaign to achieve a particular objective, and involve the use of pressure as well as persuasion, they go beyond mere protest and may be better described as cases of civil resistance or nonviolent resistance.[6]","image":"Demonstration_against_Ahmadinejad_in_Rio.jpg.webp"}
