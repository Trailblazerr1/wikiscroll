{"title":"Apollo–Soyuz","summary":"Apollo–Soyuz was the first manned international space mission, carried out jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union in July 1975. Millions of people around the world watched on television as a United States Apollo module docked with a Soviet Union Soyuz capsule. The project, and its memorable handshake in space, was a symbol of détente between the two superpowers during the Cold War, and it is generally considered to mark the end of the Space Race, which had begun in 1957 with the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1.[1]","image":"Apollo-Soyuz-Test-Program-artist-rendering.jpg.webp"}
