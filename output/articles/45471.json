{"title":"Tonight (David Bowie album)","summary":"Tonight is the 16th studio album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on 24Â September 1984 by EMI America Records. The follow-up to his most commercially successful album Let's Dance (1983), it was written and recorded in mid-1984 at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Canada, following the conclusion of the Serious Moonlight Tour. The music on Tonight has been characterised as pop, blue-eyed soul, dance and rock. Much of the album's sound is the same as its predecessor's, due to Bowie's effort to retain the new audience that he had recently attracted, although some tracks contain R&B and reggae influences.","image":"Tonight_(album).jpg.webp"}
