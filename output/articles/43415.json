{"title":"Tarantula","summary":"Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy spiders of the family Theraphosidae.[2] Currently, 1,010 species  have been identified.[3] The term \"tarantula\" is usually used to describe members of the family Theraphosidae, although many other members of the same infraorder (Mygalomorphae) are commonly referred to as \"tarantulas\" or \"false tarantulas\".  Some of the more common species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. Many New World species kept as pets have setae known as urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, cause damage to the eyes.[4]","image":"Brachypelma_klaasi_2009_G01_cropped.jpg.webp"}
