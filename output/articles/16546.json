{"title":"Flush toilet","summary":"A flush toilet (also known as a flushing toilet, water closet (WC) â€“ see also toilet names) is a toilet that disposes of human waste (principally urine and feces) by using the force of water to flush it through a drainpipe to another location for treatment, either nearby or at a communal facility, thus maintaining a separation between humans and their waste. Flush toilets can be designed for sitting (in which case they are also called \"Western\" toilets) or for squatting, in the case of squat toilets. Most modern sewage treatment systems are also designed to process specially designed toilet paper. The opposite of a flush toilet is a dry toilet, which uses no water for flushing.","image":"Toilet_photo.jpg.webp"}
