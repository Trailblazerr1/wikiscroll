{"title":"Beauveria bassiana","summary":"Beauveria bassiana is a fungus that grows naturally in soils throughout the world and acts as a parasite on various arthropod species, causing white muscardine disease; it thus belongs to the entomopathogenic fungi. It is being used as a biological insecticide to control a number of pests such as termites, thrips, whiteflies, aphids and different beetles. Its use in the control of bedbugs[1] and malaria-transmitting mosquitos is under investigation.[2]","image":"Beauveria.jpg.webp"}
