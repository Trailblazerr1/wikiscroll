{"title":"Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics","summary":"Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics is the science of the motion of bicycles and motorcycles and their components, due to the forces acting on them. Dynamics falls under a branch of physics known as classical mechanics. Bike motions of interest include balancing, steering, braking, accelerating, suspension activation, and vibration. The study of these motions began in the late 19th century and continues today.[1][2][3]","image":"BikeModel.jpg.webp","url":"Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics"}
