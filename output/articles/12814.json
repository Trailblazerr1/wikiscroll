{"title":"Dhikr","summary":"Dhikr (Arabic: ذِكْر‎, IPA: [ðɪkr], also spelled Zikr, Thikr, Zekr,[1] or Zikar,[2][3] literally meaning \"remembrance, reminder\"[4]  or \"mention\")[5] is a form of Islamic meditation in which phrases or prayers are repeatedly chanted in order to remember God.[4][6]  It plays a central role in Sufi Islam,[7] and each Sufi order has usually adopted a specific dhikr, typically accompanied by specific posture, breathing, and movement.[8] In Sufi Islam, dhikr refers to both the act of this remembrance as well as the prayers used in these acts of remembrance.[4] Dhikr can be performed in solitude or as a collective group.[8] It can be counted on a set of prayer beads (Misbaha مِسْبَحَة)[4] or through the fingers of the hand.  A person who recites the Dhikr is called a Dhakir (ذَاكِر, [ðaːkɪr]), literally \"he who remembers.\"[5] The content of the prayers includes the names of God, or a dua (prayer of supplication) taken from the hadiths or the Quran.","image":"Isma_allah_zat-new.png.webp"}
