{"title":"Angry Birds (video game)","summary":"Angry Birds (later remarketed as Angry Birds Classic) is a 2009 casual puzzle video game developed by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by a sketch of stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices starting in December 2009.[3][4] Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store,[5] which prompted the developer to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and PCs. A sequel, Angry Birds 2, was released in July 2015 for iOS and Android. Around April 2019, the game was removed from the App Store.[6]","image":"Angry_Birds_promo_art.png.webp"}
