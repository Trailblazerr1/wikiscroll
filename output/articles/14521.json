{"title":"Elf","summary":"An elf (plural: elves) is a type of humanoid supernatural being in Germanic mythology and folklore (especially North Germanic mythology and folklore). In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves generally seem to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them.[1] However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.","image":"Ängsälvor_-_Nils_Blommér_1850.jpg.webp"}
