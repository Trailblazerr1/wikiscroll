{"title":"Grocery store","summary":"A grocery store (North America), grocery[1] or grocery shop (UK) is a store that primarily retails a general range of food products,[2] which may be fresh or packaged. In everyday U.S. usage, however, \"grocery store\" is a synonym for supermarket,[3] and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries. In the UK, shops that sell food are distinguished as grocers[3] or grocery shops, though in everyday use, people usually use either the term \"supermarket\" or, for a smaller type of store that sells groceries, a \"corner shop\"[4] or \"convenience shop\".","image":"Supermarkt.jpg.webp","url":"Grocery_store"}
