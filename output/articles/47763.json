{"title":"Vulnerability (computing)","summary":"In computer security, a vulnerability is a weakness which can be exploited by a threat actor, such as an attacker, to cross privilege boundaries (i.e. perform unauthorized actions) within a computer system. To exploit a vulnerability, an attacker must have at least one applicable tool or technique that can connect to a system weakness. In this frame, vulnerabilities are also known as the attack surface.","image":"Information_Security_Incidents_by_Category%2C_Fiscal_Year_2014.svg.png.webp"}
