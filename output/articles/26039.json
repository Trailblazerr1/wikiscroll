{"title":"Li Wenliang","summary":"Li Wenliang (Chinese: 李文亮; 12 October 1985[2] – 7 February 2020[3]) was a Chinese ophthalmologist who allegedly warned people in China about early COVID-19 infections in Wuhan. On 30 December 2019, Wuhan CDC issued emergency warnings to local hospitals about a number of mysterious \"pneumonia\" cases discovered in the city in the previous week.[4] On the same day, Li, who worked at Wuhan Central Hospital, received an internal diagnostic report of a suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patient from other doctors which he in turn shared with his Wuhan University alumni through WeChat group. He was dubbed a whistleblower when that shared report later circulated publicly despite his requesting confidentiality from those with whom he shared the information.[5][6] Rumors of a deadly SARS outbreak subsequently spread on Chinese social media platforms, and Wuhan police summoned and admonished him on 3 January for \"making false comments on the Internet about unconfirmed SARS outbreak.\"[5][7]. Li's act of \"whistleblowing\" (and existence) was first publicly reported by Beijing Youth Daily on January 27, 2020.","image":"Li_Wen_Liang.jpg.webp"}
