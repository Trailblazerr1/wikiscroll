{"title":"Alberto Fujimori","summary":"Alberto Kenya Fujimori Inomoto[1] (Spanish: [alˈβeɾto fuxiˈmoɾi] or [fu(ɟ)ʝiˈmoɾi]; Japanese: 藤森謙也, born 28 July 1938)[2][3] is a Peruvian former engineer who ruled as the President of Peru from 28 July 1990 until his downfall on 22 November 2000. Frequently described as a dictator,[4] he remains a controversial figure in Peruvian politics; his government is credited with the creation of Fujimorism, defeating the Shining Path insurgency and restoring Peru's macroeconomic stability,[5][6][7][8] though Fujimori ended his presidency by fleeing Peru for Japan amid a major scandal involving corruption and human rights abuses.[9][10] Even amid his prosecution in 2008 for crimes against humanity relating to his presidency, two-thirds of Peruvians polled voiced approval for his leadership in that period.[11]","image":"Al_Fujimori.jpg.webp"}
