{"title":"Steve Davis","summary":"Steve Davis, OBE (born 22 August 1957) is an English retired professional snooker player from Plumstead, London. He is best known for dominating the sport during the 1980s, when he reached eight World Snooker Championship finals in nine years, won six world titles, and held the world number one ranking for seven consecutive seasons. The first player to make an officially recognised maximum break in professional competition, and the first to earn Â£1 million in career prize money, he famously was runner-up to Dennis Taylor in one of the sport's most memorable matches, the 1985 World Snooker Championship final. Its dramatic black-ball conclusion attracted 18.5 million viewers, setting UK records for any broadcast after midnight and any broadcast on BBC Two that still stand to this day. Davis was named the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year in 1988 and remains the only snooker player to win the award.","image":"Steve_Davis_at_German_Masters_Snooker_Final_(DerHexer)_2012-02-05_16.jpg.webp"}
