{"title":"Simple harmonic motion","summary":"In mechanics and physics, simple harmonic motion (sometimes abbreviated SHM) is a special type of periodic motion where the restoring force on the moving object is directly proportional to the  magnitude of the object's displacement and acts towards the object's equilibrium position. It results in an oscillation which, if uninhibited by friction or any other dissipation of energy, continues indefinitely.","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Simple_harmonic_motion"}
