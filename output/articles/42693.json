{"title":"Sully Sullenberger","summary":"Chesley Burnett \"Sully\" Sullenberger III (born January 23, 1951) is an American retired Air Force fighter pilot, airline captain, and is U.S. Ambassador-designate to the International Civil Aviation Organization. He is best known for his role as pilot in command in the 2009 ditching of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River off Manhattan after both engines were disabled by a bird strike; all 155 people aboard survived. Sullenberger has since become an outspoken advocate for aviation safety[1] and has helped develop new protocols for airline safety. He served as the co-chairman, along with first officer Jeffrey Skiles (his co-pilot during Flight 1549), of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA)'s Young Eagles youth introduction-to-aviation program from 2009 to 2013.[2]","image":"Chesley_\"Sully\"_Sullenberger_by_Gage_Skidmore_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
