{"title":"Deep South","summary":"The Deep South is a cultural and geographic subregion in the Southern United States. The term was first used to describe the states most dependent on plantations and chattel slavery during the early period of United States history. The region suffered economic hardship after the American Civil War and was a major site of racial tension during and after the Reconstruction era. The Civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s helped usher in a new era, sometimes referred to as the New South. Before 1945, the Deep South was often referred to as the Cotton States, since cotton was the primary cash crop for economic production.[1][2]","image":"Map_of_USA_Deep_South.svg.png.webp","url":"Deep_South"}
