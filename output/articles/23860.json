{"title":"Johns Hopkins","summary":"Johns Hopkins (May 19, 1795 â€“ December 24, 1873) was an American entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist of Baltimore, Maryland. His bequests founded numerous institutions bearing his name, most notably Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins University (including its academic divisions such as Johns Hopkins School of Nursing, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies). Although historically noted as an abolitionist, recent research indicates that Johns Hopkins was a slave owner for at least part of his life.","image":"Hopkinsp.jpg.webp","url":"Johns_Hopkins"}
