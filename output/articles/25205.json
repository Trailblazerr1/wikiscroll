{"title":"Kūkai","summary":"Kūkai (空海; 27 July 774 – 22 April 835[1]), also known posthumously as Kōbō Daishi (弘法大師, \"The Grand Master who Propagated the Dharma\"), was a Japanese Buddhist monk, calligrapher, and poet who founded the esoteric Shingon school of Buddhism. He travelled to China, where he studied Tangmi (Chinese Vajrayana Buddhism) under the monk Huiguo. Upon returning to Japan, he founded Shingon—the Japanese branch of Vajrayana Buddhism. With the blessing of several Emperors, Kūkai was able to preach Shingon teachings and found Shingon temples. Like other influential monks, Kūkai oversaw public works and constructions. Mount Kōya was chosen by him as a holy site, and he spent his later years there until his death in 835 C.E.","image":"Eight_Patriarchs_of_the_Shingon_Sect_of_Buddhism_Kukai_Cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Kūkai"}
