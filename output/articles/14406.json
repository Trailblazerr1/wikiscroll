{"title":"Electric battery","summary":"A battery is a source of electric power consisting of one or more electrochemical cells with external connections[1] for powering electrical devices such as flashlights, mobile phones, and electric cars. When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode.[2] The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that will flow through an external electric circuit to the positive terminal. When a battery is connected to an external electric load, a redox reaction converts high-energy reactants to lower-energy products, and the free-energy difference is delivered to the external circuit as electrical energy.[3] Historically the term \"battery\" specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved to include devices composed of a single cell.[4]","image":"Batteries.jpg.webp","url":"Electric_battery"}
