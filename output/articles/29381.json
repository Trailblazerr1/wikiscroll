{"title":"Mercia","summary":"Mercia (/ˈmɜːrʃiə, -ʃə, -siə/,[1][2] Old English: Miercna rīċe; Latin: Merciorum regnum) was one of the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The name is a Latinisation of the Old English Mierce or Myrce (West Saxon dialect; Merce in the Mercian dialect itself), meaning \"border people\" (see March). Mercia dominated what would later become England for three centuries, subsequently going into a gradual decline while Wessex eventually conquered and united all the kingdoms into the Kingdom of England.[3]","image":"Mercian_Supremacy_x_4_alt.png.webp","url":"Mercia"}
