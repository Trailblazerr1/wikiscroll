{"title":"Peking opera","summary":"Peking opera, or Beijing opera (Chinese: 京剧; pinyin: Jīngjù), is the most dominant form of Chinese opera, which combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and acrobatics. It arose in Beijing in the mid-Qing dynasty (1644–1912) and became fully developed and recognized by the mid-19th century.[1] The form was extremely popular in the Qing court and has come to be regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China.[2] Major performance troupes are based in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.[3] The art form is also preserved in Taiwan, where it is also known as Guójù (Chinese: 國劇; lit. 'National opera'). It has also spread to other regions such as the United States and Japan.[4]","image":"IMGP0739_(19415725842).jpg.webp"}
