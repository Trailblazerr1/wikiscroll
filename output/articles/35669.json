{"title":"Post-truth politics","summary":"Post-truth politics (also called post-factual politics[1] and post-reality politics)[2] is a political culture where true/false, honesty/lying have become a focal concern of public life and are viewed by popular commentators and academic researchers alike as having an important causal role in how politics operates at a particular point in history (especially influenced by new communication and media technologies).[3][4][5] Oxford Dictionaries declared that its international word of the year in 2016 was \"post-truth\", citing a 2,000% increase in usage compared to 2015 and noted that it was commonly associated with the noun \"post-truth politics.\"[6] Popularized as a term in news media, and a dictionary definition, post-truth has developed from a short-hand label for the abundance and influence of misleading or false political truth claims into a concept empirically studied and theorized by academic research. Since post-truth politics are primarily known through public truth statements in specific media contexts (commentary on major broadcasting networks, podcasts, YouTube videos, and other social media), it is especially studied as a media and communication studies phenomenon with particular forms of truth-telling: intentional rumors, bullshitting, lying, conspiracy theories, and fake news (subsequently gaining philosophers' attention).[4][5][7][3] Post-truth politics' historical nature has also been discussed with regard to more traditional areas of communication and journalism studies such as propaganda and disinformation.[8][9]","image":"EU_referendum_leave_poster%2C_Belfast%2C_June_2016_-_geograph.org.uk_-_4990237.jpg.webp"}
