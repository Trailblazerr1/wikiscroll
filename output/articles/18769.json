{"title":"Great Britain at the 2016 Summer Olympics","summary":"Great Britain, or in full Great Britain and Northern Ireland, represented by the British Olympic Association (BOA), competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016 and the team of selected athletes was officially known as Team GB. British athletes have appeared in every Summer Olympic Games of the modern era, alongside Australia, France, Greece, and Switzerland, though Great Britain is the only country to have won at least one gold medal at all of them. Although the British Olympic Association is the National Olympic Committee (NOC) for Great Britain and Northern Ireland,[2] Northern Irish athletes can choose whether to compete for Great Britain or for the Republic of Ireland, as they are entitled to citizenship of either nation under the Good Friday Agreement. In 2016 Northern Ireland born representatives in Team GB included returning rowers Alan Campbell, Peter Chambers and Richard Chambers, archer Patrick Huston and four members of the men's field hockey team: David Ames, Mark Gleghorne, Iain Lewers and Ian Sloan.[3][4] The team also represents, and included representation from, the Crown dependencies, among which were Guernsey's Heather Watson and Carl Hester and the Isle of Man's Tim Kneale, and from the ten of the thirteen British Overseas Territories represented by the BOA rather than their own NOC,[5] whose representatives include Turks and Caicos-born sprinter Delano Williams and Anguillan-born long jumper Shara Proctor[6]","image":"Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png.webp","url":"Great_Britain_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics"}
