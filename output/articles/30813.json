{"title":"Multiple sclerosis","summary":"Multiple sclerosis (MS), also known as encephalomyelitis disseminata, is the most common demyelinating disease,[10] in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are damaged.[1] This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to transmit signals, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems.[7][11][12] Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, and trouble with sensation or coordination.[1][13][14] MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms).[15][16] Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely, although permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.[16]","image":"MS_Demyelinisation_CD68_10xv2.jpg.webp","url":"Multiple_sclerosis"}
