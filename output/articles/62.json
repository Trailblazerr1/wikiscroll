{"title":"10 Gigabit Ethernet","summary":"10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GE, 10GbE, or 10 GigE) is a group of computer networking technologies for transmitting Ethernet frames at a rate of 10Â gigabits per second. It was first defined by the IEEE 802.3ae-2002 standard. Unlike previous Ethernet standards, 10 Gigabit Ethernet defines only full-duplex point-to-point links which are generally connected by network switches; shared-medium CSMA/CD operation has not been carried over from the previous generations Ethernet standards[1] so half-duplex operation and repeater hubs do not exist in 10GbE.[2]","image":"Avaya-10G-ERS-8600.png.webp","url":"10_Gigabit_Ethernet"}
