After forming the Native Tongues collective and collaborating on several projects, A Tribe Called Quest began recording sessions for People's Instinctive Travels in late 1989 at Calliope Studios with completion reached in early 1990. The album's laid back production encompassed a diverse range of samples which functioned as a template for the group's unorthodox lyrics.","image":"ATCQPeople'sInstinctTravels.jpg.webp","url":"People's_Instinctive_Travels_and_the_Paths_of_Rhythm"}
