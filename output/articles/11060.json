{"title":"Continental margin","summary":"A continental margin is the outer edge of continental crust abutting oceanic crust under coastal waters.  It is one of the three major zones of the ocean floor, the other two being deep-ocean basins and mid-ocean ridges. The continental shelf is the relatively shallow water area found in proximity to continents.[1] The continental margin consists of three different features: the continental rise, the continental slope, and the continental shelf.[2] Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.[1]","image":"Continental_shelf.png.webp"}
