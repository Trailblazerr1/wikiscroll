{"title":"Greek genocide","summary":"The Greek genocide[3][4][5][6][7][8][A 1] (Greek: Γενοκτονία των Ελλήνων, Genoktonia ton Ellinon), which included the Pontic genocide, was the systematic killing of the Christian Ottoman Greek population of Anatolia which was carried out during World War I and its aftermath (1914–1922) on the basis of their religion and ethnicity.[14] It was perpetrated by the government of the Ottoman Empire led by the Three Pashas and by the Government of the Grand National Assembly led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,[15] against the indigenous Greek population of the Empire. The genocide included massacres, forced deportations involving death marches through the Syrian Desert,[16] expulsions, summary executions, and the destruction of Eastern Orthodox cultural, historical, and religious monuments.[17] Several hundred thousand Ottoman Greeks died during this period.[18] Most of the refugees and survivors fled to Greece (adding over a quarter to the prior population of Greece).[19] Some, especially those in Eastern provinces, took refuge in the neighbouring Russian Empire.","image":"Smyrna-vict-families-1922.jpg.webp"}
