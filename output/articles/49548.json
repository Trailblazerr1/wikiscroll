{"title":"Zoroastrianism","summary":"Zoroastrianism or Mazdayasna is one of the world's oldest continuously-practiced religions, based on the teachings of the Iranian-speaking prophet Zoroaster (also known as Zaraθuštra in Avestan or as Zartosht in Modern Persian).[1][2] It has a dualistic cosmology of good and evil and an eschatology which predicts the ultimate conquest of evil by good.[3] Zoroastrianism exalts an uncreated and benevolent deity of wisdom known as Ahura Mazda (lit. 'Wise Lord') as its supreme being.[4] The unique historical features of Zoroastrianism, such as its monotheism,[5][6][7][8][9]  messianism, belief in judgement after death, conception of heaven and hell, and free will may have influenced other religious and philosophical systems, including Gnosticism, Greek philosophy,[10] Islam,[11] and the Baháʼí Faith.","image":"ZoroastrianismSymbolWhite.PNG.webp"}
