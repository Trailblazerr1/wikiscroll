{"title":"Baptists","summary":"Baptists form a major branch of Evangelical Christianity distinguished by baptizing professing Christian believers only (believer's baptism), and doing so by complete immersion. Baptist churches also generally subscribe to the doctrines of soul competency (the responsibility and accountability of every person before God), sola fide (salvation by faith alone), sola scriptura (scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice) and congregationalist church government. Baptists generally recognize two ordinances: baptism and communion.","image":"Baptism_logo.jpg.webp","url":"Baptists"}
