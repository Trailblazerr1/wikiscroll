{"title":"Hanseatic League","summary":"The Hanseatic League (/ˌhænsiˈætɪk/; Middle Low German: Hanse, Düdesche Hanse, Hansa; Modern German: Deutsche Hanse; Dutch: De Hanze; Latin: Hansa Teutonica)[3] was an influential medieval commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in central and northern Europe. Growing from a few north German towns in the late 12th century, the League ultimately encompassed nearly 200 settlements across seven modern-day countries; at its height, it stretched from the Netherlands in the west to Russia in the east, and from Estonia in the north reached as far south as Kraków, Poland.[4]","image":"Hanseatenwimpel.svg.png.webp","url":"Hanseatic_League"}
