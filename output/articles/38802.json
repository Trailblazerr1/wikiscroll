{"title":"Rutabaga","summary":"Rutabaga (/ˌruːtəˈbeɪɡə/; North American English) or swede (British English and some Commonwealth English) is a root vegetable, a form of Brassica napus (which also includes rapeseed).  Other names include Swedish turnip, neep (Scottish) and turnip (Canadian English, Irish English and Manx English) – however, elsewhere the name \"turnip\" usually refers to the related white turnip. The species Brassica napus originated as a hybrid between the cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and the turnip (Brassica rapa).  Rutabaga roots are eaten as human food in a variety of ways, and the leaves can be eaten as a leaf vegetable. The roots and tops are also used for livestock, either fed directly in the winter or foraged in the field during the other seasons. Scotland, Northern England, West England, the Isle of Man and Ireland had a tradition of carving the roots into lanterns at Halloween.","image":"Rutabaga%2C_variety_nadmorska.JPG.webp"}
