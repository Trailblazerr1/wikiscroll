{"title":"Smothers Brothers","summary":"The Smothers Brothers are Thomas (\"Tom\" – born February 2, 1937) and Richard (\"Dick\" – born November 20, 1938), American folk singers, musicians and comedians. The brothers' trademark double act was performing folk songs (Tommy on acoustic guitar, Dick on double bass), which usually led to arguments between the siblings. Tommy's signature line was \"Mom always liked you best!\" Tommy (the elder of the two) acted \"slow\" and Dick, the straight man, acted \"superior.\"","image":"SmothersBrothersAug04.jpg.webp","url":"Smothers_Brothers"}
