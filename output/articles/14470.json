{"title":"Electron neutrino","summary":"The electron neutrino (νe) is an elementary particle which has zero electric charge and a spin of ½. Together with the electron, it forms the first generation of leptons, hence the name electron neutrino. It was first hypothesized by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, to account for missing momentum and missing energy in beta decay, and was discovered in 1956 by a team led by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines (see Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment).[1]","image":"Symbol_portal_class.svg.png.webp"}
