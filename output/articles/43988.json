{"title":"The Byrds","summary":"The Byrds (/bɜːrdz/) were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1964.[1]  The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member.[2] Although their time as one of the most popular groups in the world only lasted for a short period in the mid-1960s, the Byrds are today considered by critics to be among the most influential rock acts of their era.[1][3][4] Their signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn's jangly twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar was \"absorbed into the vocabulary of rock\" and has continued to be influential.[1][5]","image":"The_Byrds_in_1965.jpg.webp"}
