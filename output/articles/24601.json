{"title":"Kenny McCormick","summary":"Kenneth “Kenny” McCormick[2] is one of the four main characters in the adult animated television series South Park along with Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman. His often muffled and incomprehensible speech – the result of his parka hood covering his mouth – is provided by co-creator Matt Stone. He debuted on television when South Park first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in The Spirit of Christmas shorts created by Stone and long-time collaborator Trey Parker in 1992 (Jesus vs. Frosty) and 1995 (Jesus vs. Santa).","image":"KennyMcCormick.png.webp","url":"Kenny_McCormick"}
