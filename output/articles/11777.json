{"title":"Cyanosis","summary":"Cyanosis is the change of body tissue color to a bluish-purple hue as a result of having decreased amounts of oxygen bound to the hemoglobin in the red blood cells of the capillary bed.[1] Body tissues that reflect cyanosis are usually in locations where the skin is thinner, including the mucous membranes, lips, nail beds, and ear lobes.[1] It is important to note that medications containing amiodarone or silver, Mongolian spots, large birth marks, and the consumption of food products with blue or purple dyes can also result in the bluish skin tissue discoloration and may be mistaken for cyanosis.[2][3]","image":"Cynosis.JPG.webp","url":"Cyanosis"}
