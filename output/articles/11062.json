{"title":"Contingency theory","summary":"A contingency theory is an organizational theory that claims that there is no best way to organize a corporation, to lead a company, or to make decisions. Instead, the optimal course of action is contingent (dependent) upon the internal and external situation. Contingent leaders are flexible in choosing and adapting to succinct strategies to suit change in situation at a particular period in time in the running of the organization.","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Contingency_theory"}
