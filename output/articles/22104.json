{"title":"Intellectual giftedness","summary":"Intellectual giftedness is an intellectual ability significantly higher than average. It is a characteristic of children, variously defined, that motivates differences in school programming. It is thought to persist as a trait into adult life, with various consequences studied in longitudinal studies of giftedness over the last century. There is no generally agreed definition of giftedness for either children or adults, but most school placement decisions and most longitudinal studies over the course of individual lives have followed people with IQs in the top 2.5 percent of the populationâ€”that is, IQs above 130. Definitions of giftedness also vary across cultures.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp"}
