{"title":"Women in development","summary":"Women in development is an approach of development projects that emerged in the 1960s, calling for treatment of women's issues in development projects. It is the integration of women into the global economies by improving their status and assisting in total development.   Later, the Gender and development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation.[1]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Women_in_development"}
