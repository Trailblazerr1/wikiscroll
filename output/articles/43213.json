{"title":"TED (conference)","summary":"TED Conferences LLC (Technology, Entertainment, Design) is an American media organization that posts talks online for free distribution under the slogan \"ideas worth spreading\". TED was conceived by Richard Saul Wurman, who co-founded it with Harry Marks in February 1984[4] as a conference; it has been held annually since 1990.[5] TED's early emphasis was on technology and design, consistent with its Silicon Valley origins. It has since broadened its perspective to include talks on many scientific, cultural, political, humanitarian and academic topics.[6] It has been curated by Chris Anderson, a British-American businessman, through the non-profit TED Foundation since July 2019 (originally by the non-profit Sapling Foundation).[1][7][8]","image":"TED_three_letter_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"TED_(conference)"}
