{"title":"Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937","summary":"The Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937,[1] frequently called the \"court-packing plan\",[2] was a legislative initiative proposed by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt to add more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court in order to obtain favorable rulings regarding New Deal legislation that the Court had ruled unconstitutional.[3] The central provision of the bill would have granted the president power to appoint an additional justice to the U.S. Supreme Court, up to a maximum of six, for every member of the court over the age of 70 years.","image":"Supreme_Court_1932.jpg.webp"}
