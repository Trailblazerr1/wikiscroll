{"title":"Black Hawk (Sauk leader)","summary":"Black Hawk, born Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak (1767 – October 3, 1838), was a Sauk leader and warrior who lived in what is now the Midwestern United States. Although he had inherited an important historic sacred bundle from his father, he was not a hereditary civil chief. Black Hawk earned his status as a war chief or captain by his actions: leading raiding and war parties as a young man and then a band of Sauk warriors during the Black Hawk War of 1832.","image":"George_Catlin_-_Múk-a-tah-mish-o-káh-kaik%2C_Black_Hawk%2C_Prominent_Sac_Chief_-_1985.66.2_-_Smithsonian_American_Art_Museum.jpg.webp"}
