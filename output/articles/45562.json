{"title":"Torsades de pointes","summary":"Torsades de pointes, torsade de pointes or torsades des pointes (TdP) (/tɔːˌsɑːd də ˈpwæ̃t/,[1] French: [tɔʁsad də pwɛ̃t̪], translated as \"twisting of peaks\") is a specific type of abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac death. It is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that exhibits distinct characteristics on the electrocardiogram (ECG). It was described by French physician François Dessertenne in 1966.[2] Prolongation of the QT interval can increase a person's risk of developing this abnormal heart rhythm, occurring in between 1% and 10% of patients who receive QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic drugs.[3]","image":"Torsades_de_Pointes_TdP.png.webp"}
