{"title":"Old Gutnish","summary":"Old Gutnish or Old Gotlandic[1] was a North Germanic language spoken on the Baltic island of Gotland. It shows sufficient differences from the Old West Norse and  Old East Norse dialects that it is considered to be a separate branch. While vastly divergent from Old Gutnish and closer to Modern Swedish, a modern version of Gutnish is still spoken in some parts of Gotland and the adjoining island of Fårö.","image":"Old_norse%2C_ca_900.PNG.webp","url":"Old_Gutnish"}
