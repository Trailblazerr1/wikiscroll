{"title":"Royal Navy","summary":"The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by English and Scottish kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years' War against France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is consequently known as the Senior Service.","image":"Logo_of_the_Royal_Navy.svg.png.webp","url":"Royal_Navy"}
