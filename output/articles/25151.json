{"title":"Kurta","summary":"A kurta (or sometimes kurti, for women) is a loose collarless shirt worn in many regions of South Asia,[1][2] and now also worn around the world.[3] Tracing its roots to Central Asian nomadic tunics, or upper body garments, of the late-ancient- or early-medieval era, the kurta has evolved stylistically over the centuries, especially in South Asia, as a garment for everyday wear as well as for formal occasions.[4]","image":"Kurta_traditional_front_sandalwood_buttons.jpg.webp"}
