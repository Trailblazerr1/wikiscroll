{"title":"Æthelwulf, King of Wessex","summary":"Æthelwulf (Old English pronunciation: [ˈæðelwuɫf];[2] Old English for \"Noble Wolf\";[3] died 13 January 858) was King of Wessex from 839 to 858.[lower-alpha 1] In 825, his father, King Egbert, defeated King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending a long Mercian dominance over Anglo-Saxon England south of the Humber. Egbert sent Æthelwulf with an army to Kent, where he expelled the Mercian sub-king and was himself appointed sub-king. After 830, Egbert maintained good relations with Mercia, and this was continued by Æthelwulf when he became king in 839, the first son to succeed his father as West Saxon king since 641.","image":"Æthelwulf_-_MS_Royal_14_B_VI.jpg.webp"}
