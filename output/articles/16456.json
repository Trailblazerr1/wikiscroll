{"title":"Flea market","summary":"A flea market (or swap meet) is a type of street market that provides space for vendors to sell previously-owned (second-hand) merchandise.[1][2] This type of market is often seasonal. However, in recent years there has been the development of 'formal' and 'casual' markets[3] which divides a fixed-style market (formal) with long-term leases and a seasonal-style market with short-term leases. Consistently, there tends to be an emphasis on sustainable consumption whereby items such as used goods, collectibles, antiques and vintage clothing can be purchased.[1][4]","image":"Puces_de_Montsoreau.jpg.webp","url":"Flea_market"}
