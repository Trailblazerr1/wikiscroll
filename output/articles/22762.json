{"title":"Jack Sheppard","summary":"Jack Sheppard (4 March 1702 â€“ 16 November 1724), or \"Honest Jack\", was a notorious English thief and prison escapee of early 18th-century London. Born into a poor family, he was apprenticed as a carpenter but took to theft and burglary in 1723, with little more than a year of his training to complete. He was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times from prison, making him a notorious public figure, and wildly popular with the poorer classes. Ultimately, he was caught, convicted, and hanged at Tyburn, ending his brief criminal career after less than two years. The inability of the notorious \"Thief-Taker General\" Jonathan Wild to control Sheppard, and injuries suffered by Wild at the hands of Sheppard's colleague Joseph \"Blueskin\" Blake led to Wild's downfall.","image":"Jack_Sheppard_-_Thornhill.jpg.webp"}
