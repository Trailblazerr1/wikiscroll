{"title":"Cabernet Franc","summary":"Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is sometimes made into ice wine in those regions.","image":"Cabernet-franc.jpg.webp","url":"Cabernet_Franc"}
