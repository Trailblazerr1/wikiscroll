{"title":"Karaite Judaism","summary":"Karaite Judaism (/ˈkɛərə.aɪt/) or Karaism (/ˈkɛərə.ɪzəm/, sometimes spelt Karaitism (/ˈkɛərə.ɪtɪzəm/; Hebrew: יהדות קראית‎‎, Modern: Yahadut Qara'it from, Tiberian: Qārāʾîm, meaning \"Readers\"; also spelt Qaraite Judaism, Qaraism or Qaraitism)[lower-alpha 1] is a Jewish religious movement characterized by the recognition of the written Torah alone as its supreme authority in halakha (Jewish religious law) and theology.[4] Karaites maintain that all of the divine commandments handed down to Moses by God were recorded in the written Torah without additional Oral Law or explanation. Karaite Judaism is distinct from mainstream Rabbinic Judaism, which considers the Oral Torah, codified in the Talmud and subsequent works, to be authoritative interpretations of the Torah. Consequently, Karaite Jews do not consider the written collections of the oral tradition in the Midrash or Talmud as binding.","image":"Flag_of_Israel.svg.png.webp","url":"Karaite_Judaism"}
