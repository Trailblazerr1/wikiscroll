{"title":"Penicillin","summary":"Penicillins (P, PCN or PEN) are a group of antibiotics originally obtained from Penicillium moulds, principally P. chrysogenum and P. rubens. Most penicillins in clinical use are chemically synthesised from naturally-produced penicillins. A number of natural penicillins have been discovered, but only two purified compounds are in clinical use: penicillin G (intravenous use) and penicillin V (given by mouth). Penicillins were among the first medications to be effective against many bacterial infections caused by staphylococci and streptococci. They are members of the Î²-lactam antibiotics.[1] They are still widely used today for different bacterial infections, though many types of bacteria have developed resistance following extensive use.","image":"Penicillin_core.svg.png.webp"}
