{"title":"Gibraltar national football team results","summary":"The Gibraltar national football team is the representative association football team of Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory located at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. Its governing body is the Gibraltar Football Association (GFA) and it competes as a member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Organised football has been played in Gibraltar since the 19th century.[1] The GFA first applied for UEFA membership in 1997 which was rejected, as UEFA would only allow membership for applicants recognised as sovereign states by the United Nations.[2] They were unsuccessful in their second application in 2007 when only three of UEFA's 52 associations voted in their favour.[3] In October 2012, they reapplied for membership which was granted in March 2013.[4][5] Before 2018 the team's home ground, Victoria Stadium, did not meet UEFA's standards for competitive internationals, although it could be used for international friendlies. Gibraltar's first full international was played at the Estádio Algarve, located between Faro and Loulé, Portugal, which Gibraltar used as their home stadium for competitive matches between 2014 and 2018.[6]","image":"Gibraltar_starting_XI.jpg.webp"}
