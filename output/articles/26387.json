{"title":"List of Celebrity Big Brother (British TV series) housemates","summary":"Celebrity Big Brother is a spin-off of the British reality television series Big Brother, broadcast in the UK and Ireland. Originally broadcast on Channel 4 and E4 and now broadcast on Channel 5 and 5Star, it involves a group of celebrities, called housemates, living in isolation from the outside world in a custom-built \"house\".[1][2][3][4] The actions of the participants are recorded constantly by microphones and cameras situated in each room.[2] Regularly, the housemates nominate two other members of the group each to face eviction; those with the most nominations face a public telephone vote, and the housemate who receives the most public votes is evicted.[2] This procedure continues until the final day, when the viewers vote for who of the remaining participants they want to win the programme.[3] Profits from premium-rate telephone votes are donated to charities such as Comic Relief, Centrepoint and Samaritans.[5][6]","image":"Jack_Dee_2014.JPG.webp","url":"List_of_Celebrity_Big_Brother_(British_TV_series)_housemates"}
