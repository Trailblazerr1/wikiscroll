{"title":"Anna Hazare","summary":"Kisan Baburao Hazare (pronunciation ; born 15 June 1937), popularly known as Anna Hazare (pronunciation ), is an Indian social activist who led movements to promote rural development, increase government transparency, and investigate and punish corruption in public life. In addition to organising and encouraging grassroots movements, Hazare frequently conducted hunger strikes to further his causes—a tactic reminiscent, to many, of the work of Mohandas K. Gandhi.[1][2] Hazare also contributed to the development and structuring of Ralegan Siddhi, a village in Parner taluka of Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan—the third-highest civilian award—by the Government of India in 1992 for his efforts in establishing this village as a model for others.[3]","image":"Anna_Hazare_on_2nd_Oct.JPG.webp","url":"Anna_Hazare"}
