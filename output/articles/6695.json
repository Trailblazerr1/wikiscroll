{"title":"Bipartisanship","summary":"Bipartisanship, sometimes referred to as nonpartisanship, is a political situation, usually in the context of a two-party system (especially those of the United States and some other western countries), in which opposing political parties find common ground through compromise. Partisanship is the antonym, where an individual or political party adheres only to its interests without compromise.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
