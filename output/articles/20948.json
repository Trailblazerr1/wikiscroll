{"title":"Hubris","summary":"Hubris, or, less frequently, hybris[1] (/ˈhjuːbrɪs/ or /ˈhaɪbrɪs/, from ancient Greek ὕβρις), describes a personality quality of extreme or excessive pride[2] or dangerous overconfidence,[3] often in combination with (or synonymous with) arrogance.[4] The term \"arrogance\" comes from the Latin adrogare, meaning to feel that one has a right to demand certain attitudes and behaviors from other people. To \"arrogate\" means \"to claim or seize without justification... To make undue claims to having\",[5] or \"to claim or seize without right... to ascribe or attribute without reason\".[6] The term \"pretension\" is also associated with the term hubris, but is not synonymous with hubris.[7] According to studies, hubris, arrogance and pretension are related to the need for victory (even if it doesn't always mean winning) instead of reconciliation, such as \"friendly\" groups might promote.[8] Hubris is usually perceived as a characteristic of an individual rather than a group, although the group the offender belongs to may suffer collateral consequences from  wrongful acts. Hubris often indicates a loss of contact with reality and an overestimation of one's own competence, accomplishments or capabilities. The adjectival form of the noun hubris is \"hubristic\" or \"hybristic\".[1]","image":"Atlas_Typhoeus_Prometheus.png.webp"}
