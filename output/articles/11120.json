{"title":"Cooling tower","summary":"A cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a coolant stream, usually a water stream to a lower temperature. Cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or, in the case of closed circuit cooling towers or dry cooling towers, rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the  dry-bulb air temperature using radiators.","image":"Evaporative_Cooling_Tower.jpg.webp","url":"Cooling_tower"}
