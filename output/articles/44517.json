{"title":"The Quarrymen","summary":"The Quarrymen (also written as \"the Quarry Men\") are a British skiffle/rock and roll group, formed by John Lennon in Liverpool in 1956,[3] which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Originally consisting of Lennon and several schoolfriends, the Quarrymen took their name from a line in the school song of their school, the Quarry Bank High School. Lennon's mother, Julia Lennon, taught her son to play the banjo, showed Lennon and Eric Griffiths how to tune their guitars in a similar way to the banjo, and taught them simple chords and songs.","image":"Quarrymen_In_Rosebery_Street.jpg.webp"}
