{"title":"Map (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a map is often used as a synonym for a function,[1] but may also refer to some generalizations. Originally, this was an abbreviation of mapping, which often refers to the action of applying a function to the elements of its domain. This terminology is not completely fixed, as these terms are generally not formally defined, and can be considered to be jargon.[2] These terms may have originated as a generalization of the process of making a geographical map, which consists of mapping the Earth surface to a sheet of paper.[3]","image":"Function_color_example_3.svg.png.webp","url":"Map_(mathematics)"}
