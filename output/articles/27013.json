{"title":"List of tallest buildings and structures in London","summary":"St Paul's Cathedral, built in 1710, was the tallest building in London at 111 metres (364 ft) until it was overtaken in 1963 by the Millbank Tower at 118 metres (387 ft), which in turn was overtaken by the BT Tower which topped out at 177 metres (581 ft) tall in 1964. In the 1960s and 1970s several high-rise buildings were built, located sporadically, mostly in the western side of Central London with some in the City of London. The first true \"skyscrapers\" to be built in London were the NatWest Tower (now called Tower 42) which was completed in 1980 in the City of London at 183 metres (600 ft) tall and One Canada Square which was completed in 1991 at 235 metres (771 ft) and formed the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf development. The 2000s saw a boom in skyscraper building, mostly in the City of London and Canary Wharf. However, since 2010, the tallest building in London has been The Shard at London Bridge, which was topped out at 309.6 metres (1,016 ft) in 2012. There are more tall buildings planned for the City and Canary Wharf, but there are also clusters emerging in other districts of London including: Stratford, the South Bank, Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall, Nine Elms, Islington as well as in places in Outer London such as Croydon.","image":"BT_Tower%2C_London%2C_15_March_2011.jpg.webp"}
