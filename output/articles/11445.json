{"title":"Creatine","summary":"Creatine (/ˈkriːətiːn/ or /ˈkriːətɪn/)[1] is an organic compound with the nominal formula (H2N)(HN)CN(CH3)CH2CO2H.  This species exists in various modifications (tautomers) in solution.  Creatine is found in vertebrates where it facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), primarily in muscle and brain tissue. Recycling is achieved by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP via donation of phosphate groups. Creatine also acts as a buffer.[2]","image":"Creatine2.png.webp","url":"Creatine"}
