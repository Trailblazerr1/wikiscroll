{"title":"Cheddar Gorge","summary":"Cheddar Gorge is a limestone gorge in the Mendip Hills, near the village of Cheddar, Somerset, England. The gorge is the site of the Cheddar show caves, where Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in 1903.[1] Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000â€“13,000 years ago) have been found.[2] The caves, produced by the activity of an underground river, contain stalactites and stalagmites. The gorge is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Cheddar Complex.[3]","image":"Cheddar_Gorge%2C_Somerset%2C_UK_-_Diliff.jpg.webp"}
