{"title":"Stella Gibbons","summary":"Stella Dorothea Gibbons (5 January 1902 – 19 December 1989) was an English author, journalist, and poet. She established her reputation with her first novel, Cold Comfort Farm (1932) which has been reprinted many times. Although she was active as a writer for half a century, none of her later 22 novels or other literary works—which included a sequel to Cold Comfort Farm—achieved the same  critical or popular success. Much of her work was long out of print  before a modest revival in the 21st century.","image":"StellaGibbons.jpg.webp","url":"Stella_Gibbons"}
