{"title":"Acetylcholine","summary":"Acetylcholine (ACh) is an organic chemical that functions in the brain and body of many types of animals (including humans) as a neurotransmitterâ€”a chemical message released by nerve cells to send signals to other cells, such as neurons, muscle cells and gland cells.[1] Its name is derived from its chemical structure: it is an ester of acetic acid and choline. Parts in the body that use or are affected by acetylcholine are referred to as cholinergic. Substances that increase or decrease the overall activity of the cholinergic system are called cholinergics and anticholinergics, respectively.","image":"Acetylcholin.svg.png.webp"}
