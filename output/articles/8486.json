{"title":"Capillary","summary":"A capillary is a small blood vessel from 5 to 10 micrometres (Î¼m) in diameter. Capillaries are composed of only the tunica intima, consisting of a thin wall of simple squamous endothelial cells.[2] They are the smallest blood vessels in the body: they convey blood between the arterioles and venules. These microvessels are the site of exchange of many substances with the interstitial fluid surrounding them. Substances which cross capillaries include water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, urea,[3] glucose, uric acid, lactic acid and creatinine. Lymph capillaries connect with larger lymph vessels to drain lymphatic fluid collected in the microcirculation.","image":"A_red_blood_cell_in_a_capillary%2C_pancreatic_tissue_-_TEM.jpg.webp","url":"Capillary"}
