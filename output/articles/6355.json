{"title":"Beta-galactosidase","summary":"β-galactosidase, also called lactase, beta-gal or β-gal, is a family of glycoside hydrolase enzymes that catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-galactosides into monosaccharides through the breaking of a glycosidic bond. β-galactosides include carbohydrates containing galactose where the glycosidic bond lies above the galactose molecule. Substrates of different β-galactosidases include ganglioside GM1, lactosylceramides, lactose, and various glycoproteins.[1]","image":"Beta-galactosidase_(1tg7).png.webp"}
