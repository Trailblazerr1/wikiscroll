{"title":"Locust","summary":"Locusts (derived from the Vulgar Latin locusta, meaning grasshopper[1]) are a group of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers in the family Acrididae that have a swarming phase. These insects are usually solitary, but under certain circumstances they become more abundant and change their behaviour and habits, becoming gregarious. No taxonomic distinction is made between locust and grasshopper species; the basis for the definition is whether a species forms swarms under intermittently suitable conditions.","image":"Locusta-migratoria-wanderheuschrecke.jpg.webp"}
