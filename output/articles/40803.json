{"title":"Singular value decomposition","summary":"In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        Ã—\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m\\times n}\n  \n matrix. It is related to the polar decomposition.","image":"12b23d207d23dd430b93320539abbb0bde84870d.svg"}
