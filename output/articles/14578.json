{"title":"Elizabethan era","summary":"The Elizabethan era is the epoch in the Tudor period of the history of England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558â€“1603). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. The symbol of Britannia (a female personification of Great Britain) was first used in 1572, and often thereafter, to mark the Elizabethan age as a renaissance that inspired national pride through classical ideals, international expansion, and naval triumph over Spain.","image":"Queen_Elizabeth_I_by_George_Gower.jpg.webp","url":"Elizabethan_era"}
