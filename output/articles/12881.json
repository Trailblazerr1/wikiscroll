{"title":"Diastole","summary":"Diastole (/daɪˈæstəli/ dy-AST-ə-lee) is the part of the cardiac cycle during which the heart refills with blood after the emptying is done during systole (contraction). Ventricular diastole is the period during which the two ventricles are relaxing from the contortions/wringing of contraction, then dilating and filling; atrial diastole is the period during which the two atria likewise are relaxing under suction, dilating, and filling. The term originates from the Greek word διαστολή (diastolē), meaning \"dilation\",[1] from διά (diá, \"apart\") + στέλλειν (stéllein, \"to send\").","image":"Heart_diastole.png.webp"}
