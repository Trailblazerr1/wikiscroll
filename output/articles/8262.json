{"title":"Call Me Maybe","summary":"\"Call Me Maybe\" is a song recorded by Canadian singer-songwriter Carly Rae Jepsen[1] for her EP Curiosity (2012) and later appeared on her second studio album and first international album Kiss (2012). The song was written by Jepsen and Tavish Crowe as a folk song, but its genre was modified to pop following the production by Josh Ramsay. It was released as the lead single from the EP on September 20, 2011, through 604 Records. Jepsen was signed to Schoolboy Records, releasing her single in the United States through the label, as the first single from Kiss. Musically, \"Call Me Maybe\" is a teen pop, dance-pop and bubblegum pop track that alludes to the inconvenience that love at first sight brings to a girl who hopes for a call back from a new crush.","image":"Carly_Rae_Jepsen_-_Call_Me_Maybe.png.webp"}
