{"title":"Groundwater recharge","summary":"Groundwater recharge or deep drainage or deep percolation is a hydrologic process, where water moves downward from surface water to groundwater. Recharge is the primary method through which water enters an aquifer. This process usually occurs in the vadose zone below plant roots and, is often expressed as a flux to the water table surface. Groundwater recharge also encompasses water moving away from the water table farther into the saturated zone.[1] Recharge occurs both naturally (through the water cycle) and through anthropogenic processes (i.e., \"artificial groundwater recharge\"), where rainwater and or reclaimed water is routed to the subsurface.","image":"Surface_water_cycle.svg.png.webp","url":"Groundwater_recharge"}
