{"title":"Curse of the Bambino","summary":"The Curse of the Bambino was a superstitious sports curse in Major League Baseball (MLB) derived from the 86-year championship drought of the Boston Red Sox from 1918 to 2004. The superstition was named after Babe Ruth, colloquially known as \"The Bambino\", who played for the Red Sox until he was sold to the New York Yankees in 1920.[1] While some fans took the curse seriously, most used the expression in a tongue-in-cheek manner.[2]","image":"Babe_Ruth_Red_Sox_1918.jpg.webp","url":"Curse_of_the_Bambino"}
