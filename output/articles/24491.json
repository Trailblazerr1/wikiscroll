{"title":"Katsudō Shashin","summary":"Katsudō Shashin (活動写真, \"motion picture\"), sometimes called the Matsumoto fragment, is a Japanese animated filmstrip that is the oldest known work of animation from Japan. Its creator is unknown. Evidence suggests it was made before 1912, so it may predate the earliest displays of Western animated films in Japan. It was discovered in a collection of films and projectors in Kyoto in 2005.","image":"Katsudō_Shashin.jpg.webp"}
