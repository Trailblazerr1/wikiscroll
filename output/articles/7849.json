{"title":"Buildings and architecture of Bath","summary":"The buildings and architecture of Bath, a city in Somerset in the south west of England, reveal significant examples of the architecture of England, from the Roman Baths (including their significant Celtic presence), to the present day. The city became a World Heritage Site in 1987, largely because of its architectural history[1] and the way in which the city landscape draws together public and private buildings and spaces.[2] The many examples of Palladian architecture are purposefully integrated with the urban spaces to provide \"picturesque aestheticism\".[2] In 2021, the city was added to a second World Heritage Site, a group of historic spa towns across Europe known as the \"Great Spas of Europe\". Bath is the only entire city in Britain to achieve World Heritage status,[3][4] and is a popular tourist destination.","image":"Aerial.view.of.bath.arp.jpg.webp"}
