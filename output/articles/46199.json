{"title":"Turquoise","summary":"Turquoise is an opaque, blue-to-green mineral that is a hydrated phosphate of copper and aluminium, with the chemical formula CuAl6(PO4)4(OH)8·4H2O. It is rare and valuable in finer grades and has been prized as a gemstone and ornamental stone for thousands of years owing to its unique hue. Like most other opaque gems, turquoise has been devalued by the introduction of treatments, imitations and synthetics into the market. The robin’s egg blue or sky blue color of the Persian Turquoise mined near the modern city of Neyshabur has been used as a guiding reference for evaluating turquoise quality.[4]","image":"Turquoise-40031.jpg.webp","url":"Turquoise"}
