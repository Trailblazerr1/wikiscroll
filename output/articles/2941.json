{"title":"Aliyah","summary":"Aliyah (US: /ˌæliˈɑː/, UK: /ˌɑː-/; Hebrew: עֲלִיָּה‎ aliyah, \"ascent\") is the emigration of Jews from the diaspora to the Land of Israel historically, which today includes the modern State of Israel. Also defined as \"the act of going up\"—that is, towards Jerusalem—\"making aliyah\" by moving to the Land of Israel is one of the most basic tenets of Zionism. The opposite action, emigration from the \"Land of Israel\", is referred to in Hebrew as yerida (\"descent\").[1] The State of Israel's Law of Return gives Jews, their children, and their grandchildren automatic rights regarding residency and Israeli citizenship.","image":"PikiWiki_Israel_20841_The_Palmach.jpg.webp","url":"Aliyah"}
