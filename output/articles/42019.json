{"title":"Star-nosed mole","summary":"The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is a small mole found in moist, low areas in the northern parts of North America.[3] It is the only member of the tribe having a touch organ with more than 25,000 minute sensory receptors, known as Eimer's organs, with which this hamster-sized mole feels its way around. With the help of its Eimer's organs, it may be perfectly poised to detect seismic wave vibrations.[4]","image":"Condylura.jpg.webp"}
