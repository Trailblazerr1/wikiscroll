{"title":"Unitary state","summary":"A unitary state is a state governed as a single entity in which the central government is ultimately supreme. The central government may create (or abolish) administrative divisions (sub-national units).[1] Such units exercise only the powers that the central government chooses to delegate. Although political power may be delegated through devolution to regional or local governments by statute, the central government may abrogate the acts of devolved governments or curtail (or expand) their powers.","image":"Map_of_unitary_and_federal_states.svg.png.webp","url":"Unitary_state"}
