{"title":"Frank Dux","summary":"Frank William Dux ( /ˈdjuːks/; born April 6, 1956) is a Canadian martial artist, fight choreographer and author. According to Dux, a ninjutsu expert named Senzo Tanaka trained him as a ninja when he was a teenager. He established his own school of ninjutsu called Dux Ryu Ninjutsu, and has said he won a secret martial arts tournament called the Kumite in 1975. His alleged victory at the Kumite served as the inspiration for the 1988 film Bloodsport starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Dux's victory at the Kumite has been disputed, as has the existence of both the Kumite he described and Senzo Tanaka.","image":"John_Salazar_and_B.G._Burkett_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Frank_Dux"}
