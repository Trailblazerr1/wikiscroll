{"title":"Stainless steel","summary":"Stainless steel[1][2][3]: 276  is a group of ferrous alloys that contain a minimum of approximately 11% chromium,[4]: 3 [5] a composition that prevents the iron from rusting and also provides heat-resistant properties.[4]: 3 [5][6][7][8] Different types of stainless steel include the elements carbon (from 0.03% to greater than 1.00%), nitrogen, aluminium, silicon, sulfur, titanium, nickel, copper, selenium, niobium, and molybdenum.[4]: 3  Specific types of stainless steel are often designated by their AISI three-digit number, e.g., 304 stainless.[9] The ISO 15510 standard lists the chemical compositions of stainless steels of the specifications in existing ISO, ASTM, EN, JIS, and GB (Chinese) standards in a useful interchange table.[10]","image":"Inside_detail_of_DEMACO_DTC-1000_Treatment_Center_for_Fresh_Pasta_Production_(October_1995)_002.jpg.webp"}
