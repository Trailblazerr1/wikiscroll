{"title":"Circuit design","summary":"The process of circuit design can cover systems ranging from complex electronic systems all the way down to the individual transistors within an integrated circuit.  For simple circuits the design process can often be done by one person without needing a planned or structured design process, but for more complex designs, teams of designers following a systematic approach with intelligently guided computer simulation are becoming increasingly common.  In integrated circuit design automation, the term \"circuit design\" often refers to the step of the design cycle which outputs the schematics of the integrated circuit. Typically this is the step between logic design and physical design.[1]","image":"76477_Musical_Organ.JPG.webp","url":"Circuit_design"}
