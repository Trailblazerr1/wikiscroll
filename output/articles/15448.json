{"title":"Evoked potential","summary":"An evoked potential  or evoked response is an electrical potential in a specific pattern recorded from a specific part of the nervous system, especially the brain, of a human or other animals following presentation of a stimulus such as a light flash or a pure tone.  Different types of potentials result from stimuli of different modalities and types.[1] EP is distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiologic recording method. Such potentials are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring that include detections of disease and drug-related sensory dysfunction and intraoperative monitoring of sensory pathway integrity.[2]","image":"VEP-normal.gif","url":"Evoked_potential"}
