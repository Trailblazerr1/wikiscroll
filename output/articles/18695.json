{"title":"Granulocyte","summary":"Granulocytes are cells in the innate immune system characterized by the presence of specific granules in their cytoplasm.[1] They are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, PML, or PMNL) because of the varying shape of the nucleus, which is usually lobed into three segments. This distinguishes them from the mononuclear agranulocytes. The term polymorphonuclear leukocyte often refers specifically to \"neutrophil granulocytes\",[2] the most abundant of the granulocytes; the other types (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells) have fewer lobes. Granulocytes are produced via granulopoiesis in the bone marrow.","image":"PBEosinophil.jpg.webp","url":"Granulocyte"}
