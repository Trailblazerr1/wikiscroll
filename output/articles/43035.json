{"title":"Swiss Armed Forces","summary":"The Swiss Armed Forces (German: Schweizer Armee, French: Arm√©e suisse, Italian: Esercito svizzero, Romansh: Armada svizra) operates on land and in the air, serving as the primary armed forces of Switzerland. Under the country's militia system, regular soldiers constitute a small part of the military and the rest are conscripts or volunteers aged 19 to 34 (in some cases up to 50). Because of Switzerland's long history of neutrality, the Swiss Armed Forces do not take part in conflicts in other countries, but do participate in international peacekeeping missions. Switzerland is part of the NATO Partnership for Peace programme.[3]","image":"Armee_CH_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Swiss_Armed_Forces"}
