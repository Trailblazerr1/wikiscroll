{"title":"Miscegenation","summary":"Miscegenation (/mɪˌsɛdʒəˈneɪʃən/) is the interbreeding of people who are considered to be members of different races.[1] The word, usually considered pejorative, is derived from a combination of the Latin terms miscere (meaning \"to mix\" by German mistranslation; actually meaning \"to move\") and genus (\"race\") from the Hellenic γένος.[2] The word first appeared in \"Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro,\" a pretended anti-Abolitionist pamphlet David Goodman Croly and others published anonymously in advance of the 1864 U.S. presidential election.[2][3] The term came to be associated with laws that banned interracial marriage and sex, which were known as anti-miscegenation laws.[4]","image":"Miscegenation_1864.jpg.webp","url":"Miscegenation"}
