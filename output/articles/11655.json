{"title":"Cultivar","summary":"A cultivar is a type of plant that people have bred for desired traits, which are reproduced in each new generation by a method such as grafting, tissue culture or carefully controlled seed production. Most cultivars arise from purposeful human manipulation, but some originate from wild plants that have distinctive characteristics. Cultivar names are chosen according to rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP), and not all cultivated plants qualify as cultivars. Horticulturists generally believe the word cultivar[nb 1] was coined as a term which means \"cultivated variety\".","image":"African_daisy_(Osteospermum_sp._'Pink_Whirls').jpg.webp"}
