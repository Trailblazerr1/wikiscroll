{"title":"Shah","summary":"Shah (/ʃɑː/; Persian: شاه‎, romanized: Šâh or Šāh, pronounced [ʃɒːh], transl. 'king') was a title given to the emperors and kings of Iran (historically known as \"Persia\" in the Western world).[1] It was also adopted by the kings of Shirvan (a historical Iranian region in Transcaucasia); namely the Shirvanshahs and Khwarazmshahs. The title was also used by Persianate societies, such as the rulers and offspring of the Ottoman Empire, the Kazakh Khanate, the Khanate of Bukhara, the Emirate of Bukhara, the Mughal Empire, the Bengal Sultanate, various Gurkha rulers, and historical Afghan dynasties.[2] In Iran proper as well as in the Greater Iran region, the title saw continuous usage. Rather than \"king\" in the European sense, each Iranian ruler regarded himself as the Shahanshah (شاهنشاه‎, Šāhanšāh, lit. 'King of Kings') or Padishah (پادشاه‎, Pādešāh, lit. 'Master King') of the Persian Empire.","image":"Pahlavi_Crown_of_Imperial_Iran_(heraldry).svg.png.webp","url":"Shah"}
