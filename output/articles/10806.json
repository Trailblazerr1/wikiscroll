{"title":"Compulsory figures","summary":"Compulsory figures or school figures were formerly a segment of figure skating, and gave the sport its name. They are the \"circular patterns which skaters trace on the ice to demonstrate skill in placing clean turns evenly on round circles\".[1] For approximately the first 50 years of figure skating as a sport, until 1947, compulsory figures made up 60 percent of the total score at most competitions around the world. These figures continued to dominate the sport, although they steadily declined in importance, until the International Skating Union (ISU) voted to discontinue them as a part of competitions in 1990. Learning and training in compulsory figures instilled discipline and control; some in the figure skating community considered them necessary to teach skaters basic skills. Skaters would train for hours to learn and execute them well, and competing and judging figures would often take up to eight hours during competitions.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-K1217-0035%2C_Sonja_Morgenstern.jpg.webp","url":"Compulsory_figures"}
