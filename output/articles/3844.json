{"title":"Anorgasmia","summary":"Anorgasmia is a type of sexual dysfunction in which a person cannot achieve orgasm despite adequate stimulation. Anorgasmia is far more common in females (4.6 percent)[1] than in males and is especially rare in younger men. The problem is greater in women who are post-menopause.[1] In males, it is most closely associated with delayed ejaculation. Anorgasmia can often cause sexual frustration.","image":"Prostatelead.jpg.webp","url":"Anorgasmia"}
