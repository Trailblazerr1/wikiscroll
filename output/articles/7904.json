{"title":"Bureaucracy","summary":"The term bureaucracy (/bjʊəˈrɒkrəsi/) may refer both to a body of non-elected governing officials (bureaucrats) and to an  administrative policy-making group.[1] Historically, a bureaucracy was a government administration managed by departments staffed with non-elected officials.[2] Today, bureaucracy is the administrative system governing any large institution, whether publicly owned or privately owned.[3][4] The public administration in many jurisdictions and sub-jurisdictions exemplifies bureaucracy, but so does any centralized hierarchical structure of an institution, e.g. hospitals, academic entities, business firms, professional societies, social clubs, etc.","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp","url":"Bureaucracy"}
