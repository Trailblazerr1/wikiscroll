{"title":"SOS","summary":"SOS is a Morse code distress signal (  ▄ ▄ ▄ ▄▄▄ ▄▄▄ ▄▄▄ ▄ ▄ ▄ ), used internationally, that was originally established for maritime use. In formal notation SOS is written with an overscore line, to indicate that the Morse code equivalents for the individual letters of \"SOS\" are transmitted as an unbroken sequence of three dots / three dashes / three dots, with no spaces between the letters.[1] In International Morse Code three dots form the letter \"S\" and three dashes make the letter \"O\", so \"S O S\" became a common way to remember the order of the dots and dashes. (IWB, VZE, 3B, and V7 form equivalent sequences, but traditionally SOS is the easiest to remember.)","image":"Thesos.jpg.webp","url":"SOS"}
