{"title":"Turkish people","summary":"The Turkish people, or simply the Turks, (Turkish: TÃ¼rkler) are the world's largest Turkic ethnic group; they speak various dialects of the Turkish language and form a majority in Turkey and Northern Cyprus. In addition, centuries-old ethnic Turkish communities still live across other former territories of the Ottoman Empire. The ethnic Turks can be distinguished by a number of cultural and regional variants, but do not function as separate ethnic groups.[96][80] In particular, the culture of the Anatolian Turks in Asia Minor underlies the Turkish nationalist ideology.[96] Other Turkish groups include the Rumelian Turks in the Balkans;[80][97] Turkish Cypriots on the island of Cyprus (in addition to recent \"mainland Turks\");[98] Turkish Meskhetians originally based in Meskheti, Georgia;[99] and ethnic Turkish people across the Middle East,[80] where they are also called \"Turkmen\" or \"Turkoman\" in the Levant (e.g. Iraqi Turkmen, Syrian Turkmen, Lebanese Turkmen, etc.).[100] Consequently, the Turks form the largest minority group in Bulgaria,[60] the third largest group in Iraq,[45] Libya,[101] North Macedonia,[63] and Syria,[93] and the third largest minority group in Kosovo.[72] They also form substantial communities in the Western Thrace region of Greece, the Dobruja region of Romania, the Akkar region in Lebanon, as well as minority groups in other post-Ottoman Balkan and Middle Eastern countries. Due to mass migrations from the 19th century onward, these Turkish communities have all contributed to the formation of a Turkish diaspora outside the former Ottoman lands. Thus, the Turks also form the largest ethnic minority group in Austria,[102] Denmark,[103] Germany,[104] and the Netherlands.[104] There are also Turkish communities in other parts of Europe as well as in North America, Australia, and the Post-Soviet states.","image":"Map_of_the_Turkish_Diaspora_in_the_World.svg.png.webp"}
