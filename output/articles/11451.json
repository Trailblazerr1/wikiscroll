{"title":"Creator in Buddhism","summary":"Buddhism is a religion that does not include the belief in a creator deity, or any eternal divine personal being.[1][2][3] Buddhism's teachings say that there are divine beings called devas (sometimes translated as 'gods') and other Buddhist deities, heavens and rebirths in its doctrine of saṃsāra or cyclical rebirth. Buddhism teaches that none of these gods as a creator or as being eternal, though they can live very long lives.[4][5] In Buddhism, the devas are also trapped in the cycle of rebirth and are not necessarily virtuous. Thus while Buddhism includes multiple gods, its main focus is not on them. Peter Harvey calls this \"trans-polytheistic\".[6]","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp"}
