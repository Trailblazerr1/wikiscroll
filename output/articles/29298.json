{"title":"Membrane potential","summary":"Membrane potential (also transmembrane potential or membrane voltage) is the difference in electric potential between the interior and the exterior of a biological cell. For the exterior of the cell, typical values of membrane potential, normally given in units of millivolts and denoted as mV, range from –80 mV to –40 mV.","image":"Basis_of_Membrane_Potential2.png.webp","url":"Membrane_potential"}
