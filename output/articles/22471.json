{"title":"Iroquois","summary":"The Iroquois (/ˈɪrəkwɔɪ/ or /ˈɪrəkwɑː/) or Haudenosaunee (/ˌhoʊdinoʊˈʒoʊniː/;[3] \"People of the Longhouse\") are an indigenous confederacy in northeast North America. They were known during the colonial years to the French as the Iroquois League, and later as the Iroquois Confederacy. The English called them the Five Nations, comprising the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca (listed geographically from east to west). After 1722, the Iroquoian-speaking Tuscarora people from the southeast were accepted into the confederacy, which became known as the Six Nations.","image":"Flag_of_the_Iroquois_Confederacy.svg.png.webp","url":"Iroquois"}
