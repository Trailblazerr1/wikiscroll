{"title":"Eyelid","summary":"An eyelid is a thin fold of skin that covers and protects an eye. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle retracts the eyelid, exposing the cornea to the outside, giving vision. This can be either voluntarily or involuntarily.  The human eyelid features a row of eyelashes along the eyelid margin, which serve to heighten the protection of the eye from dust and foreign debris, as well as from perspiration. \"Palpebral\" (and \"blepharal\") means relating to the eyelids.  Its key function is to regularly spread the tears and other secretions on the eye surface to keep it moist, since the cornea must be continuously moist.  They keep the eyes from drying out when asleep.  Moreover, the blink reflex protects the eye from foreign bodies.","image":"Stye02.jpg.webp","url":"Eyelid"}
