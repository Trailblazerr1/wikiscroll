{"title":"Potsdam Conference","summary":"The Potsdam Conference (German: Potsdamer Konferenz) was held in Potsdam, Germany, from July 17 to August 2, 1945 to allow the three leading Allies to plan the postwar peace, while avoiding the mistakes of the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The participants were the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They were represented respectively by Premier Joseph Stalin, Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee, and President Harry S. Truman. They gathered to decide how to administer Germany, which had agreed to an unconditional surrender nine weeks earlier. The goals of the conference also included establishing the postwar order, solving issues on the peace treaty, and countering the effects of the war.","image":"L_to_R%2C_British_Prime_Minister_Winston_Churchill%2C_President_Harry_S._Truman%2C_and_Soviet_leader_Josef_Stalin_in_the..._-_NARA_-_198958.jpg.webp"}
