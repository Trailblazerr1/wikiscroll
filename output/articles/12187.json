{"title":"David Berman (musician)","summary":"David Cloud Berman (David Craig Berman; January 4, 1967 – August 7, 2019) was an American musician, singer and poet. In 1989, with Pavement's Stephen Malkmus and Bob Nastanovich, he founded the indie rock band Silver Jews, and was its only constant member until its dissolution in 2009. He provided the Silver Jews' characteristic lyrics and, with Malkmus, the simple country-rock sound they developed from their early lo-fi recordings. His abstract, autobiographical lyrics were his creative priority, and he extensively labored over them. Despite believing his work was unappreciated, Berman cultivated a passionate following and became an influential figure in indie rock, known for his unadorned voice.","image":"David_Berman_performing_at_ATP_festival%2C_18th_May_2008.jpg.webp","url":"David_Berman_(musician)"}
