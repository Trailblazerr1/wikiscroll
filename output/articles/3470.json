{"title":"Anarchy (international relations)","summary":"In international relations theory, anarchy is the idea that the world lacks any supreme authority or sovereign. In an anarchic state, there is no hierarchically superior, coercive power that can resolve disputes, enforce law, or order the system of international politics. In international relations, anarchy is widely accepted as the starting point for international relations theory.[1]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp"}
