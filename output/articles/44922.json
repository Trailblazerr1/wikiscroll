{"title":"Third Anglo-Afghan War","summary":"The Third Anglo-Afghan War (Persian: جنگ سوم افغان-انگلیس‎; Pashto: د افغان-انگرېز درېمه جگړه‎), also known as the Third Afghan War, the British-Afghan War of 1919[4], or in Afghanistan as the War of Independence,[4] began on 6 May 1919, when the Emirate of Afghanistan invaded British India and ended with an armistice on 8 August 1919. The war resulted in a treaty with the Afghans gaining independence and control of foreign affairs from Britain, and the British recognising Durand line as the border between Afghanistan and British India.[5] According to British author Michael Barthorp, it was a strategic victory for the British because the Durand Line was reaffirmed as the border between Afghanistan and the British Raj,[6][7] and the Afghans agreed not to foment trouble on the British side. However, Afghans who were on the British side of the border did cause concerns due to revolts.","image":"Soldiers_in_action_at_Kohat_during_the_Third_Anglo-Afghan_War.jpg.webp","url":"Third_Anglo-Afghan_War"}
