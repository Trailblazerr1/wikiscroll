{"title":"Deity","summary":"A deity or god is a supernatural being considered divine or sacred.[1] The Oxford Dictionary of English defines deity as a god or goddess (in a polytheistic religion), or anything revered as divine.[2] C. Scott Littleton defines a deity as \"a being with powers greater than those of ordinary humans, but who interacts with humans, positively or negatively, in ways that carry humans to new levels of consciousness, beyond the grounded preoccupations of ordinary life\".[3]","image":"Sri_Mariamman_Temple_Singapore_2_amk.jpg.webp"}
