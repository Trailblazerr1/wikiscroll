Greek astronomers employed the term asteres planetai (ἀστέρες πλανῆται), \"wandering stars\", for star-like objects which apparently moved over the sky. Over the millennia, the term has included a variety of different objects, from the Sun and the Moon to satellites and asteroids.","image":"Voyager_2_Neptune_and_Triton.jpg.webp"}
