{"title":"Compaq","summary":"Compaq (a portmanteau of Compatibility And Quality, occasionally referred to as CQ prior to its final logo) was an American information technology company founded in 1982 that developed, sold, and supported computers and related products and services. Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers, being the second company after Columbia Data Products[1]  to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer.[2][3] It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001.[4] Struggling to keep up in the price wars against Dell, as well as with a risky acquisition of DEC,[5] Compaq was acquired for US$25 billion by HP in 2002.[6][7] The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower-end systems until 2013 when it was discontinued.[8]","image":"Compaq_logo_until_2008_with_protection_zone.svg.png.webp","url":"Compaq"}
