{"title":"Grimoire","summary":"A grimoire (/ɡrɪmˈwɑːr/ grim-WAHR) (also known as a \"book of spells\" or a \"spellbook\") is a textbook of magic, typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits, deities, and demons.[1] In many cases, the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers, although in many cultures, other sacred texts that are not grimoires (such as the Bible) have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically. The only contents found in a grimoire would be information on spells, rituals, the preparation of magical tools, and lists of ingredients and their magical correspondences.[2] In this manner, while all books on magic could be thought of as grimoires, not all magical books should be thought of as grimoires.[3]","image":"Talis02.png.webp","url":"Grimoire"}
