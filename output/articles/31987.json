{"title":"Nicaraguans","summary":"Nicaraguans (Spanish: Nicarag√ºenses; also Nicas) are people inhabiting in, originating or having significant heritage from Nicaragua. Most Nicaraguans live in Nicaragua, although there is also a significant Nicaraguan diaspora, particularly in the United States and Costa Rica with smaller communities in other countries around the world. There are also people living in Nicaragua who are not Nicaraguans because they were not born or raised in Nicaragua nor have they gained citizenship.","image":"Flag_of_Nicaragua.svg.png.webp","url":"Nicaraguans"}
