{"title":"Hotel California","summary":"\"Hotel California\" is the title track from the Eagles' album of the same name and was released as a single in February 1977.[6]  Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder (music), Don Henley, and Glenn Frey (lyrics). Joe Walsh came up with the dual-guitar descending arpeggio part that ends the song: he did not, however, get writing credits. The Eagles' original recording of the song features Henley singing the lead vocals and concludes with an extended section of electric guitar interplay between Felder and Walsh.","image":"Hotel_California_by_the_Eagles_US_vinyl_single.png.webp","url":"Hotel_California"}
