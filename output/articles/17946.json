{"title":"German nuclear weapons program","summary":"The German nuclear weapons program (German: Uranprojekt; informally known as the Uranverein; English: “Uranium Project”) was an unsuccessful scientific effort led by Germany to research and develop atomic weapons during World War II. It went through several phases of work, but in the words of a historian, it was ultimately \"frozen at the laboratory level\" with the \"modest goal\" to \"build a nuclear reactor which could sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction for a significant amount of time and to achieve the complete separation of at least tiny amount of the uranium isotopes.\" The scholarly consensus is that it failed to achieve these goals.[1][2]","image":"German_Experimental_Pile_-_Haigerloch_-_April_1945.jpg.webp"}
