{"title":"Jackal","summary":"Jackals are medium-sized omnivorous mammals of the subtribe Canina, which also includes wolves and the domestic dog, among other species. While the word \"jackal\" has historically been used for many small canines, in modern use it most commonly refers to three species: the closely related black-backed jackal and side-striped jackal of sub-Saharan-Africa, and the golden jackal of south-central Europe and Asia.","image":"Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Golden_Jackal_(1).jpg.webp"}
