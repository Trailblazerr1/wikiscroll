{"title":"Steady-state economy","summary":"A steady-state economy is an economy made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant population size. In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time.[1]: 366–369  [2]: 545  The term usually refers to the national economy of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the entire world. Early in the history of economic thought, classical economist Adam Smith of the 18th century developed the concept of a stationary state of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of stationarity.[3]: 78","image":"Diagram_of_natural_resource_flows-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Steady-state_economy"}
