{"title":"Celtic languages","summary":"The Celtic languages (usually /ˈkɛltɪk/, but sometimes /ˈsɛltɪk/ in the US)[1] are a group of related languages descended from Proto-Celtic. They form a branch of the Indo-European language family.[2] The term \"Celtic\" was first used to describe this language group by Edward Lhuyd in 1707,[3] following Paul-Yves Pezron, who made the explicit link between the Celts described by classical writers and the Welsh and Breton languages.[4]","image":"Celtic_expansion_in_Europe.png.webp","url":"Celtic_languages"}
