{"title":"Jester","summary":"A jester, court jester, or fool was a member of the household of a nobleman or a monarch employed to entertain guests during the medieval and Renaissance eras. Jesters were also itinerant performers who entertained common folk at fairs and town markets, and the discipline continues into the modern-day, where jesters perform at historically-themed events.","image":"lossy-page1-220px-Hinric_Hasenberger%2C_the_Court_Jester_(David_Kl√∂cker_Ehrenstrahl)_-_Nationalmuseum_-_18637.tif.jpg.webp"}
