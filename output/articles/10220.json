{"title":"Clavichord","summary":"The clavichord is a Western European  stringed rectangular keyboard instrument[1] that was used largely in the Late Middle Ages, through the Renaissance, Baroque and Classical eras.[2]\nHistorically, it was mostly used as a practice instrument and as an aid to composition, not being loud enough for larger performances.[2]  The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents. Vibrations are transmitted through the bridge(s) to the soundboard.[1]","image":"Hillclavichord.jpg.webp"}
