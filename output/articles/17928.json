She was the only aircraft carrier launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarine's attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.","image":"Graf-Zeppelin-2.jpg.webp","url":"German_aircraft_carrier_Graf_Zeppelin"}
