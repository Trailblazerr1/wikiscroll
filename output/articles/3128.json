{"title":"Alzheimer's disease","summary":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens.[2] It is the cause of 60â€“70% of cases of dementia.[2][12] The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events.[1][13] As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues.[1][2] As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society.[1] Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death.[14] Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.[9][15]","image":"Brain-ALZH.png.webp","url":"Alzheimer's_disease"}
