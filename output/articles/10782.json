{"title":"Complex adaptive system","summary":"A complex adaptive system is a system that is complex in that it is a dynamic network of interactions, but the behavior of the ensemble may not be predictable according to the behavior of the components. It is adaptive in that the individual and collective behavior mutate and self-organize corresponding to the change-initiating micro-event or collection of events.[1][2][3] It is a \"complex macroscopic collection\" of relatively \"similar and partially connected micro-structures\" formed in order to adapt to the changing environment and increase their survivability as a macro-structure.[1][2][4] The Complex Adaptive Systems approach builds on replicator dynamics.[5]","image":"Evolution_of_complexity.svg.png.webp","url":"Complex_adaptive_system"}
