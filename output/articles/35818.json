{"title":"Predestination","summary":"Predestination, in Christian theology, is the doctrine that all events have been willed by God, usually with reference to the eventual fate of the individual soul.[1] Explanations of predestination often seek to address the \"paradox of free will\", whereby God's omniscience seems incompatible with human free will. In this usage, predestination can be regarded as a form of religious determinism; and usually predeterminism, also known as theological determinism.","image":"Juan_de_la_Abad√≠a%2C_'The_Elder'_-_Saint_Michael_Weighing_Souls_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp","url":"Predestination"}
