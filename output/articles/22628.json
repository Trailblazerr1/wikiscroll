{"title":"Italian lira","summary":"The lira (Italian: [ˈliːra]; plural lire [ˈliːre]) was the currency of Italy between 1861 and 2002. It was first introduced by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy in 1807 at par with the French franc, and was subsequently rolled out by the different states that would eventually form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. It was subdivided into 100 centesimi (singular: centesimo), which means \"hundredths\" or \"cents\". The lira was also the currency of the Albanian Kingdom from 1941-1943.","image":"Italian_lira_banknotes.JPG.webp","url":"Italian_lira"}
