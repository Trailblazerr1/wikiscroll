{"title":"Hebrews","summary":"The terms Hebrews (Hebrew: עבריים‎ / עִבְרִים‎, Modern: ʿĪvrīm / ʿĪvrīyyīm, Tiberian: ʿĪḇrīm / ʿĪḇrīyyīm; ISO 259-3: ʕibrim / ʕibriyim) and Hebrew people are mostly considered synonymous with the Semitic-speaking Israelites, especially in the pre-monarchic period when they were still nomadic. However, in some instances it may also be used in a wider sense, referring to the Phoenicians, or to other ancient groups, such as the group known as Shasu of Yhw on the eve of the Bronze Age collapse,[1] which appears 34 times within 32 verses[2][3][4] of the Hebrew Bible. It is sometimes regarded as an ethnonym[5] and sometimes not.[6][7]","image":"Judaean_people_are_being_deported_into_exile_after_the_capture_of_Lachish.jpg.webp"}
