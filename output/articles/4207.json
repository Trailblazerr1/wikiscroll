{"title":"Arab citizens of Israel","summary":"The Arab citizens of Israel[3] are citizens of Israel who are ethnically Arab. These include Palestinians, the Negev Bedouin, Druze people and Christian and Muslim Arabs who do not identify as Palestinians. Various terms are used for the Arab population in Arabic, including 48-Palestinian or 48-Arab (Arabic: فلسطينيو 48، عرب 48‎, romanized: Filastiniyyū Thamaniya Wa-Arba'in, Arab Thamaniya Wa-Arba'in). Ever since the Nakba, the Palestinians that have remained within Israel's 1948 borders have been colloquially known as \"48 Arabs\".[4] The Arab population is called Israeli-Arabs or simply \"Arabs\" by Israel,[5][6] and international media often use Arab-Israeli to distinguish them from Palestinians in the Palestinian territories.[7]","image":"Flag_of_Israel.svg.png.webp","url":"Arab_citizens_of_Israel"}
