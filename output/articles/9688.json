{"title":"Chinese architecture","summary":"Chinese architecture is an architectural style that developed over millennia in China, before spreading out to influence architecture throughout East Asia. Since the solidification of the style during the early imperial period, the structural principles of Chinese architecture have remained largely unchanged, the main changes being only the decorative details. Starting with the Tang dynasty, Chinese architecture has had a major influence on the architectural styles of Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Vietnam, and a varying amount of influence on the architectural styles of Southeast and South Asia including Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and the Philippines.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]","image":"Pagoda_of_Songyue_Temple%2C_2015-09-25_20.jpg.webp"}
