{"title":"Psalm 150","summary":"Psalm 150 is the 150th and final psalm of the Book of Psalms, beginning in English in the King James Version: \"Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary\".  In Latin, it is known as \"Laudate Dominum in sanctis eius\".[1] In Psalm 150, the psalmist urges the congregation to praise God with music and dancing, naming nine types of musical instruments. For this reason it is also called \"the musicians' psalm\".  The Book of Psalms is part of the third section of the Hebrew Bible, and a book of the Christian Old Testament. In most versions of the Bible, the Book of Psalms has 150 psalms and Psalm 150 is the final one. However, that is not the case in the Eastern Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox canons, which have 151 and 155 psalms respectively.","image":"Jerusalem_Tomb_of_David_BW_1.JPG.webp"}
