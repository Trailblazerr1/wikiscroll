{"title":"Smog","summary":"Smog, or smoke fog, is a type of intense air pollution. The word \"smog\" was coined in the early 20th century, and is a contraction (portmanteau) of the words smoke and fog[1] to refer to smoky fog due to its opacity, and odor.[2]  The word was then intended to refer to what was sometimes known as pea soup fog, a familiar and serious problem in London from the 19th century to the mid-20th century. This kind of visible air pollution is composed of nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxide, ozone, smoke and other particulates. Man-made smog is derived from coal combustion emissions, vehicular emissions, industrial emissions, forest and agricultural fires and photochemical reactions of these emissions.","image":"Fanhe_Town_10_day_interval_contrast.png.webp"}
