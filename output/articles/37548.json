{"title":"Relative density","summary":"Relative density, or specific gravity,[1][2] is the ratio of the density (mass of a unit volume) of a substance to the density of a given reference material. Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to water at its densest (at 4 °C or 39.2 °F); for gases, the reference is air at room temperature (20 °C or 68 °F). The term \"relative density\" is often preferred in scientific usage.","image":"f1d4021a80b8db72714469bdf72b058e7a72b2e8.svg","url":"Relative_density"}
