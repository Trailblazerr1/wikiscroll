{"title":"Drop (liquid)","summary":"A drop or droplet is a small column of liquid, bounded completely or almost completely by free surfaces. A drop may form when liquid accumulates at the lower end of a tube or other surface boundary, producing a hanging drop called a pendant drop. Drops may also be formed by the condensation of a vapor or by atomization of a larger mass of solid.","image":"Water_drop_animation_enhanced_small.gif","url":"Drop_(liquid)"}
