{"title":"Hebrew language","summary":"Hebrew (עִבְרִית‎, ʿĪvrīt , IPA: [ivˈʁit] or [ʕivˈɾit]) is a Northwest Semitic language of the Afroasiatic language family. Historically, it is regarded as the spoken language of the Israelites and their longest-surviving descendants: the Judeans and Samaritans. It was largely preserved throughout history as the main liturgical language in Judaism (post-Second Temple) and in Samaritanism. Hebrew is the only Canaanite language still spoken today, and the only truly successful example of a dead language that has been revived. It is also one of only two Northwest Semitic languages still in use, with the other being Aramaic.[10][11]","image":"Temple_Scroll.png.webp","url":"A%2fHebrew_language"}
