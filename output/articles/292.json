{"title":"1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson","summary":"In 1993, Los Angeles dentist and screenwriter Evan Chandler publicly accused the American pop singer Michael Jackson of sexually abusing his 13-year-old son, Jordan Christopher \"Jordy\" Chandler. In February 1993, Jordan's stepfather, car dealer David Schwartz, introduced Jordan to Jackson after Jackson rented a vehicle from Schwartz's dealership. Though Chandler initially encouraged the friendship, he later confronted his ex-wife June, who had custody of Jordan, with suspicions that Jordan had been in an inappropriate relationship with Jackson; June dismissed the idea.","image":"Aerial-NeverlandRanch2-28-08.jpg.webp"}
