{"title":"Classical Chinese poetry","summary":"Classical Chinese poetry is traditional Chinese poetry written in Classical Chinese and  typified by certain traditional forms, or modes; traditional genres; and connections with particular historical periods, such as the poetry of the Tang Dynasty. The existence of classical Chinese poetry is documented at least as early as the publication of the Classic of Poetry, (the Shijing). Various combinations of forms and genres have developed over the ages. Many or most of these poetic forms were developed by the end of the Tang Dynasty, in 907 CE.","image":"è©©-bigseal.svg.png.webp"}
