{"title":"Bill of lading","summary":"A bill of lading (/ˈleɪdɪŋ/) (sometimes abbreviated as B/L or BOL) is a document issued by a carrier (or their agent) to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. Although the term historically related only to carriage by sea, a bill of lading may today be used for any type of carriage of goods.[1] Bills of lading are one of three crucial documents used in international trade to ensure that exporters receive payment and importers receive the merchandise.[2] The other two documents are a policy of insurance and an invoice.[lower-alpha 1] Whereas a bill of lading is negotiable, both a policy and an invoice are assignable. In international trade outside the United States, bills of lading are distinct from waybills in that the latter are not transferable and do not confer title. Nevertheless, the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 grants \"all rights of suit under the contract of carriage\" to the lawful holder of a bill of lading, or to the consignee under a sea waybill or a ship's delivery order.","image":"Nautical_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Bill_of_lading"}
