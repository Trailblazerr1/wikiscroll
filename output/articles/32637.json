It is the municipal seat for the surrounding Municipality of Oaxaca.  It is in the Centro District in the Central Valleys region of the state, in the foothills of the Sierra Madre at the base of the Cerro del Fortín, extending to the banks of the Atoyac River.[1] Heritage tourism makes up an important part of the city's economy, and it has numerous colonial-era structures as well as significant archeological sites and elements of the continuing native Zapotec and Mixtec cultures.[1] The city, together with the nearby archeological site of Monte Albán, was designated in 1987 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the site of the month-long cultural festival called the \"Guelaguetza\", which features Oaxacan dance from the seven regions, music, and a beauty pageant for indigenous women.[2]","image":"MonteAlbanWest.jpg.webp","url":"Oaxaca_City"}
