{"title":"Progress Party (Norway)","summary":"The Progress Party (Bokmål: Fremskrittspartiet; Nynorsk: Framstegspartiet; Northern Sami: Ovddádusbellodat), commonly abbreviated as FrP, is a right-wing political party in Norway.[8][9][10] The FrP has traditionally self-identified as classical-liberal[11] and as a libertarian party[12][13][14] but is generally positioned to the right of the Conservative Party, and is considered the most right-wing party to be represented in parliament. It is often described as moderately right-wing populist;[15][16] this characterization has also been disputed in both academic and public discourse.[17][18][19] By 2020, the party attained a growing national conservative faction.[4] After the 2017 parliamentary election, it was Norway's third largest political party, with 26 representatives in the Storting.[20] It was a partner in the government coalition led by the Conservative Party from 2013 to 2020.[21]","image":"Fremskrittspartiet_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Progress_Party_(Norway)"}
