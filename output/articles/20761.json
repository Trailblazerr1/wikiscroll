{"title":"Honus Wagner","summary":"Johannes Peter \"Honus\" Wagner (/ˈhɒnəs ˈwæɡnər/; February 24, 1874 – December 6, 1955[1]), sometimes referred to as \"Hans\" Wagner, was an American baseball shortstop who played 21 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1897 to 1917, almost entirely for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Wagner won his eighth (and final) batting title in 1911, a National League record that remains unbroken to this day, and matched only once, in 1997, by Tony Gwynn. He also led the league in slugging six times and stolen bases five times. Wagner was nicknamed \"The Flying Dutchman\" due to his superb speed and German heritage.  This nickname was a nod to the popular folk-tale made into a famous opera by the German composer Richard Wagner.\nIn 1936, the Baseball Hall of Fame inducted Wagner as one of the first five members. He received the second-highest vote total, behind Ty Cobb's 222 and tied with Babe Ruth at 215.","image":"Honus_Wagner_(crop).JPG.webp"}
