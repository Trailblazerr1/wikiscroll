{"title":"Bioterrorism","summary":"Bioterrorism is terrorism involving the intentional release or dissemination of biological agents. These agents are bacteria, viruses, insects, fungi or toxins, and may be in a naturally occurring or a human-modified form, in much the same way as in biological warfare. Further, modern agribusiness is vulnerable to anti-agricultural attacks by terrorists, and such attacks can seriously damage economy as well as consumer confidence.[1] The latter destructive activity is called agrobioterrorism and is a subtype of agro-terrorism.[2]","image":"NBC-Mask_M-17.jpg.webp","url":"Bioterrorism"}
