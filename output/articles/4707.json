{"title":"Assyria","summary":"Assyria (/əˈsɪriə/) (Akkadian: 𒀸𒋩, Classical Syriac: ܐܬܘܪ‎ or ܐܫܘܪ), also at times called the Assyrian Empire, was a Mesopotamian kingdom and empire of the Ancient Near East that existed as a state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC (in the form of the Assur city-state[5]) until its collapse between 612 BC and 605 BC, thereby spanning the periods of the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age.[6][7]  This vast span of time is divided into the Early Period (2500–2025 BC), Old Assyrian Empire (2025–1378 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (1392–934 BC) and Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC). A Semitic-speaking realm, Assyria was centred on the Tigris River in Upper Mesopotamia, a region which covered,  in modern terms, northern Iraq, northeast Syria, and southeast Turkey, with fringe areas of northwest Iran. After its fall Assyria remained a geo-political entity under the control of various empires until the mid-7th century AD.","image":"Ancient_Egypt_and_Mesopotamia_c._1450_BC.png.webp","url":"Assyria"}
