{"title":"John B. Watson","summary":"John Broadus Watson (January 9, 1878 â€“ September 25, 1958) was an American psychologist who popularized the scientific theory of behaviorism, establishing it as a psychological school.[3] Watson advanced this change in the psychological discipline through his 1913 address at Columbia University, titled Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It.[4] Through his behaviorist approach, Watson conducted research on animal behavior, child rearing, and advertising, as well as conducting the controversial \"Little Albert\" experiment and the Kerplunk experiment. He was also the editor of Psychological Review from 1910 to 1915.[5] A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Watson as the 17th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.[6]","image":"John_Broadus_Watson.JPG.webp"}
