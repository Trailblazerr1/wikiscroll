{"title":"Ahimsa in Jainism","summary":"Ahinsā (Ahinsā, alternatively spelled 'ahinsa', Sanskrit: अहिंसा IAST: ahinsā, Pāli:[1] avihinsā) in Jainism is a fundamental principle forming the cornerstone of its ethics and doctrine. Ahinsa was included as a fundamental principle by the 24th and last tirthankar of Jainism, Lord Mahavir and was not included by earlier tirthankars of Jainism. The term ahinsa means nonviolence, non-injury and absence of desire to harm any life forms. Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa.  There are five specific transgressions of Ahinsa principle in Jain scriptures - Binding of animals, beating, mutilating limbs, overloading, withholding food and drink. Any other interpretation is subject to individual choices and not authorized by scriptures.[2] [3] \nThe Jain concept of ahimsa is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies. Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others. But according to the Jain philosophy, violence refers primarily to injuring one's own self – behaviour which inhibits the soul's own ability to attain moksha (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths).[4]  At the same time it also implies violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one's own soul. Furthermore, the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential. All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential. Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ahimsa. According to Jainism, protection of life, also known as abhayadānam, is the supreme charity that a person can make.[5]\nThe often quoted text Ahinsa parmo dharma is immediately succeeded by the quote Dharm Hinsa Tathaiv Cha. This means that Non Violence is the supreme form of religion but to protect one's religion, even if it requires violence, is the superior form of religion but should be practiced as exception.\nAhimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence.[6] Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages.[7]","image":"Ahinsa_Parmo_Dharm_1.jpg.webp"}
