{"title":"Electrical injury","summary":"Electrical injury is a physiological reaction caused by electric current passing through the body.[2] The injury depends on the density of the current, tissue resistance and duration of contact.[3] Very small currents may be imperceptible or produce a light tingling sensation. A shock caused by low and otherwise harmless current could startle an individual and cause injury due to jerking away or falling. Stronger currents may cause some degree of discomfort or pain, while more intense currents may induce involuntary muscle contractions, preventing the person from breaking free of the source of electricity.[4] Still larger currents result in tissue damage and may trigger ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest. Consequences of injury from electricity may  include amputations, bone fractures and orthopedic and musculoskeletal injuries.[5] If death results from an electric shock the cause of death is generally referred to as electrocution.","image":"Lightning_injury.jpg.webp","url":"Electrical_injury"}
