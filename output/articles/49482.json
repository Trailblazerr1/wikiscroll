{"title":"Zhuge Liang","summary":"Zhuge Liang (pronunciation in PRC Standard Mandarin: [ʈʂú.kɤ̀ ljâŋ] (listen); 181–234),[2] courtesy name Kongming, was a Chinese statesman and military strategist. He was chancellor and later regent of the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. He is recognised as the most accomplished strategist of his era, and has been compared to Sun Tzu, the author of The Art of War.[3] His reputation as an intelligent and learned scholar grew even while he was living in relative seclusion, earning him the nickname \"Wolong\" or \"Fulong\", meaning \"Crouching Dragon\" or \"Sleeping Dragon\". Zhuge Liang is often depicted wearing a Taoist robe and holding a hand fan made of crane feathers.[4]","image":"蜀汉丞相忠武侯诸葛亮.jpg.webp","url":"Zhuge_Liang"}
