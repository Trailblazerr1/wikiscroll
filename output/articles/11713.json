{"title":"Curator","summary":"A curator (from Latin: cura, meaning \"to take care\")[1] is a manager or overseer. When working with cultural organizations, a curator is typically a \"collections curator\" or an \"exhibitions curator\", and has multifaceted tasks dependent on the particular institution and its mission. In recent years the role of curator has evolved alongside the changing role of museums, and the term \"curator\" may designate the head of any given division. More recently, new kinds of curators have started to emerge: \"community curators\", \"literary curators\", \"digital curators\" and \"biocurators\".","image":"LBJ_Foundation_DIG14005_035_(32274126330).jpg.webp"}
