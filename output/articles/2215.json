In Creative Cloud, a monthly or annual subscription service is delivered over the Internet.[3][4] Software from Creative Cloud is downloaded from the Internet, installed directly on a local computer and used as long as the subscription remains valid. Online updates and multiple languages are included in the CC subscription. Creative Cloud was initially hosted on Amazon Web Services, but a new agreement with Microsoft has the software, beginning with the 2017 version, hosted on Microsoft Azure.[5]","image":"Adobe_Creative_Cloud_rainbow_icon.svg.png.webp"}
