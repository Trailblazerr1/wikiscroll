{"title":"Toxocara canis","summary":"Toxocara canis (also known as dog roundworm) is a worldwide-distributed helminth parasite of dogs and other canids. The name is derived from the Greek word \"toxon,\" meaning bow or quiver, and the Latin word \"caro,\" meaning flesh.[1]  They live in the small intestine of the definitive host. In adult dogs, the infection is usually asymptomatic but may be characterized by diarrhea. By contrast, massive infection with Toxocara canis can be fatal in puppies, causing diarrhea, vomiting, an enlarged abdomen, flatulence, and poor growth rate.[2][3]","image":"Canine_roundworm_1.JPG.webp","url":"Toxocara_canis"}
