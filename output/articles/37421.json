{"title":"Red junglefowl","summary":"The red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) is a tropical bird in the family Phasianidae. It ranges across much of Southeast Asia and parts of South Asia. It was formerly known as the Bankiva or Bankiva Fowl. It is the species that encompasses the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus); the grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl have also contributed genetic material to the gene pool of the  chicken.[2][3] While chickens are also classified as red junglefowl, the term often only refers to wild subspecies in common parlance.","image":"Red_Junglefowl_(male)_-_Thailand.jpg.webp"}
