{"title":"Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award","summary":"The Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player Award is presented annually by the Associated Press (AP) to a player in the National Football League (NFL) deemed to have been the \"most valuable\" in that year's regular season. While there have been many selectors of NFL MVPs in the past, today the MVP award presented by the AP is considered the de facto official NFL MVP award and the most prestigious.[1][2] Since 2011, the NFL has held the annual NFL Honors ceremony to recognize the winner of each year's AP MVP award, along with other AP awards, such as the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year and AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year.[3] The most recent AP NFL MVP is quarterback Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers.[4]","image":"Aaron_Rodgers_crop.jpg.webp"}
