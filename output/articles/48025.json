{"title":"Water fluoridation","summary":"Water fluoridation is the controlled adjustment of fluoride to a public water supply solely to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water contains fluoride at a level that is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride.[2] Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces the rate at which tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes in the early stages of cavities.[3] Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $1.12 per person-year.[2][4] Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits.[5] In 2011, the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5Â mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride.[6]  Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.[7]","image":"Glass-half-full.jpeg.webp","url":"Water_fluoridation"}
