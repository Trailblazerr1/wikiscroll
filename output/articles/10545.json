{"title":"Colony collapse disorder","summary":"Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is an abnormal phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a honey bee colony disappear, leaving behind a queen, plenty of food, and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees.[1] While such disappearances have occurred sporadically throughout the history of apiculture, and have been known by various names (including disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease),[2] the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006[3] in conjunction with a drastic rise in reports of disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. Beekeepers in most European countries had observed a similar phenomenon since 1998, especially in Southern and Western Europe;[4][5] the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.[6] The phenomenon became more global when it affected some Asian and African countries as well.[7][8]","image":"Honeybee-cooling_cropped.jpg.webp"}
