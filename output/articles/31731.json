{"title":"Neural circuit","summary":"A neural circuit is a population of neurons interconnected by synapses to carry out a specific function when activated.[1] Neural circuits interconnect to one another to form large scale brain networks.[2] Biological neural networks have inspired the design of artificial neural networks, but artificial neural networks are usually not strict copies of their biological counterparts.","image":"Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png.webp","url":"Neural_circuit"}
