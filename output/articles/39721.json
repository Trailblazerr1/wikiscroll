{"title":"Scottish clan","summary":"A Scottish clan (from Gaelic clann, literally 'children', more broadly 'kindred'[1]) is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing.","image":"Scottish_clan_map.png.webp","url":"Scottish_clan"}
