{"title":"Cult of personality","summary":"A cult of personality, or cult of the leader,[1] arises when a country's regime uses the techniques of mass media, propaganda, the big lie, spectacle, the arts, patriotism, and government-organized demonstrations and rallies to create an idealized and heroic image of a leader, often through unquestioning flattery and praise.  A cult of personality is similar to apotheosis, except that it is established by modern social engineering techniques, usually by the state or the party in one-party states and dominant-party states. It is often seen in totalitarian or authoritarian countries.","image":"Poster_of_Azerbaijan_1938._Constitutions.jpg.webp","url":"Cult_of_personality"}
