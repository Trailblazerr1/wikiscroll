{"title":"Battle of Arawe","summary":"The Battle of Arawe (also known as Operation Director[3][4]) was fought between Allied and Japanese forces during the New Britain campaign of World War II. The battle formed part of the Allied Operation Cartwheel, and had the objective of serving as a diversion before a larger landing at Cape Gloucester in late December 1943. The Japanese military was expecting an Allied offensive in western New Britain, and was reinforcing the region at the time of the Allied landing in the Arawe area on 15Â December 1943. The Allies secured Arawe after about a month of intermittent fighting with the outnumbered Japanese force.","image":"Arawe_(AWM_016332).jpg.webp"}
