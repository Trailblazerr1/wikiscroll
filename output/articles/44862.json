{"title":"Thermal conduction","summary":"Thermal conduction is the transfer of internal energy by microscopic collisions of particles and movement of electrons within a body. The colliding particles, which include molecules, atoms and electrons, transfer disorganized microscopic kinetic and potential energy, when joined known as internal energy. Conduction takes place in most phases: solid, liquid, and plasma.","image":"ea2b988ea630d2c5571afe47efa3d3b251708acb.svg"}
