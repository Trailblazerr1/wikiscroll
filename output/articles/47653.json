{"title":"Vivisection","summary":"Vivisection (from Latin  vivus 'alive', and  sectio 'cutting') is surgery conducted for experimental purposes on a living organism, typically animals with a central nervous system, to view living internal structure. The word is, more broadly, used as a pejorative[1] catch-all term for experimentation on live animals[2][3][4] by organizations opposed to animal experimentation,[5] but the term is rarely used by practising scientists.[3][6] Human vivisection, such as live organ harvesting, has been perpetrated as a form of torture.","image":"Lab_mouse_mg_3157.jpg.webp","url":"Vivisection"}
