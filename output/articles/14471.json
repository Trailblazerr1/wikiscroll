{"title":"Electron shell","summary":"In chemistry and atomic physics, an electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom's nucleus. The closest shell to the nucleus is called the \"1 shell\" (also called the \"K shell\"), followed by the \"2 shell\" (or \"L shell\"), then the \"3 shell\" (or \"M shell\"), and so on farther and farther from the nucleus. The shells correspond to the principal quantum numbers (n = 1, 2, 3, 4 ...) or are labeled alphabetically with the letters used in X-ray notation (K, L, M, …).","image":"Atomic-orbital-clouds_spdf_m0.png.webp"}
