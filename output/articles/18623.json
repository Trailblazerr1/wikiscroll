{"title":"Grammatical aspect","summary":"Aspect is a grammatical category that expresses how an action, event, or state, denoted by a verb, extends over time. Perfective aspect is used in referring to an event conceived as bounded and unitary, without reference to any flow of time during (\"I helped him\"). Imperfective aspect is used for situations conceived as existing continuously or repetitively as time flows (\"I was helping him\"; \"I used to help people\").","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
