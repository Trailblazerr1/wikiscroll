{"title":"Press release","summary":"A press release is an official statement delivered to members of the news media for the purpose of providing information, creating an official statement, or making an announcement directed for public release. Press releases are also considered a primary source, meaning they are original informants for information. A press release is traditionally composed of nine structural elements, including a headline, dateline, introduction, body, and other components. Press releases are typically delivered to news media electronically, ready to use, and often subject to \"do not use before\" time, known as an news embargo.","image":"page1-240px-Wikimedia_Foundation_press_release_template.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Press_release"}
