{"title":"Aquaculture of salmonids","summary":"The aquaculture of salmonids is the farming and harvesting of salmonids under controlled conditions for both commercial and recreational purposes. Salmonids (particularly salmon and rainbow trout), along with carp, and tilapia are the three most important fish species in aquaculture.[2] The most commonly commercially farmed salmonid is the Atlantic salmon. In the U.S. Chinook salmon and rainbow trout are the most commonly farmed salmonids for recreational and subsistence fishing through the National Fish Hatchery System.[3]  In Europe, brown trout are the most commonly reared fish for recreational restocking.[4] Commonly farmed nonsalmonid fish groups include tilapia, catfish, sea bass, and bream.","image":"Time_series_for_global_aquaculture_of_true_salmon.png.webp","url":"Aquaculture_of_salmonids"}
