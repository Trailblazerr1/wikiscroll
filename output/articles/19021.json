{"title":"Griswold v. Connecticut","summary":"Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that the Constitution of the United States protects the liberty of married couples to buy and use contraceptives without government restriction. The case involved a Connecticut \"Comstock law\" that prohibited any person from using \"any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception\". The court held that the statute was unconstitutional, and that \"the clear effect of [the Connecticut law ...] is to deny disadvantaged citizens ... access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control.\"  By a vote of 7â€“2, the Supreme Court invalidated the law on the grounds that it violated the \"right to marital privacy\", establishing the basis for the right to privacy with respect to intimate practices. This and other cases view the right to privacy as a right to \"protect[ion] from governmental intrusion\".[1]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp","url":"Griswold_v._Connecticut"}
