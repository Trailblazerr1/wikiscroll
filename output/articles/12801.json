{"title":"Dexter (TV series)","summary":"Dexter is an American crime drama television series that aired on Showtime from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013.[1] Set in Miami, the series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a forensic technician specializing in bloodstain pattern analysis for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department, who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down murderers who have not been adequately punished by the justice system due to corruption or legal technicalities. The show's first season was derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first in a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by James Manos Jr., who wrote the first episode.[2] Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works.","image":"Dexter_TV_Series_Title_Card.jpg.webp","url":"Dexter_(TV_series)"}
