{"title":"Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen","summary":"Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (born Nicolae Georgescu, 4 February 1906 â€“ 30 October 1994) was a Romanian mathematician, statistician and economist. He is best known today for his 1971 magnum opus The Entropy Law and the Economic Process, in which he argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. A progenitor and a paradigm founder in economics, Georgescu-Roegen's work was decisive for the establishing of ecological economics as an independent academic sub-discipline in economics.","image":"Diagram_of_natural_resource_flows-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Nicholas_Georgescu-Roegen"}
