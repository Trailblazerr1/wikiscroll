{"title":"Rattlesnake","summary":"Rattlesnakes are a group of venomous snakes of the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus[1] of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). All rattlesnakes are vipers. The scientific name Crotalus is derived from the Greek κρόταλον, meaning \"castanet\".[2] The name Sistrurus is the Latinized form of the Greek word for \"tail rattler\" (Σείστρουρος, seistrouros) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum, a type of rattle.[3] The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies,[4] all native to the Americas, ranging from southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, and southern British Columbia in Canada to central Argentina. The largest rattlesnake, the eastern diamondback, can measure up to 8 ft (2.4 m) in length.[5] Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents.","image":"Crotalus_cerastes_mesquite_springs_CA-2.jpg.webp"}
