{"title":"Life on Mars (song)","summary":"\"Life on Mars?\" is a song by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, first released on his 1971 album Hunky Dory. In 1968, Bowie was commissioned to write English lyrics for the Claude Fran√ßois French song \"Comme d'habitude\". After his lyrics were rejected, songwriter Paul Anka rewrote it into \"My Way\", which became famous by singer Frank Sinatra in 1969. Annoyed at the success of \"My Way\", Bowie used the song as a template and wrote \"Life on Mars?\" as a parody of Sinatra's recording. Like other songs Bowie wrote during this period, it was written primarily on piano. Recording for \"Life on Mars?\" took place on 6 August 1971, the final day of the Hunky Dory sessions. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, the backing band consisted of guitarist Mick Ronson, bassist Trevor Bolder and drummer Mick Woodmansey; Ronson also composed the song's string arrangement. After failing to acquire pianist Dudley Moore, piano was played by Strawbs member Rick Wakeman.","image":"Bowie_LifeOnMars.jpg.webp"}
