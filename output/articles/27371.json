{"title":"Los Angeles County, California","summary":"Los Angeles County, officially the County of Los Angeles,[7] and sometimes abbreviated as L.A. County, is the most populous county in the United States and in the U.S. state of California,[8] with more than ten million inhabitants as of the 2020 census.[9] It is the most populous non–state-level government entity in the United States. Its population is greater than that of 40 individual U.S. states. Compared with other metropolitan areas, it has the 2nd largest economy in the world, with a nominal GDP of more than $1.0 trillion. At 4,083 square miles (10,570 km2) and with 88 incorporated cities and many unincorporated areas, it is larger than the combined areas of Delaware and Rhode Island. The county is home to more than one-quarter of California residents and is one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the United States.[10] Its county seat, Los Angeles, is also California's most populous city and the second most populous city in the United States, with about four million residents. Over time, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining the county's and region's water security.[11][12][13][14]","image":"20190616154621!Echo_Park_Lake_with_Downtown_Los_Angeles_Skyline.jpg.webp"}
