{"title":"Cloud seeding","summary":"Cloud seeding is a type of weather modification that aims to change the amount or type of precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud. Its effectiveness is debated; some studies have suggested that it is \"difficult to show clearly that cloud seeding has a very large effect\".[2] The usual objective is to increase precipitation (rain or snow), either for its own sake or to prevent precipitation from occurring in days afterward.","image":"Cloud_Seeding.svg.png.webp"}
