{"title":"Handover of Hong Kong","summary":"The Hong Kong handover, domestically known as the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, was the formal passing of authority over the territory of the then colony of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China at midnight on 1 July 1997. This event ended 156 years of British rule in the former colony. Hong Kong was reestablished as a special administrative region of China, and partially continues to maintain its economic and governing systems distinct from those of mainland China. With the passing of the 2020 Hong Kong national security law, the mainland Chinese government has begun to pare back the independence of the Hong Kong governance. The law assigned judiciary power over cases related to the law to judges that are selected by the Beijing government, which has reduced the scope of Hong Kong's judicial independence. The law stipulates that complicated cases may be tried in mainland China, which enables the mainland government to ensure that such cases fall under its purview. In practice, the law has been used to limit speech and actions that may be seen as critical of the mainland government or as supportive of Hong Kong independence.[1]","image":"The_Monument_in_Commemoration_of_the_Return_of_Hong_Kong_to_China.jpg.webp","url":"Handover_of_Hong_Kong"}
