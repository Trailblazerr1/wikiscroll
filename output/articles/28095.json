{"title":"Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award","summary":"The Major League Baseball All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award is an annual Major League Baseball (MLB) award which is presented to the most outstanding player in each year's MLB All-Star Game. Awarded each season since 1962 (two games were held and an award was presented to each game winner in 1962), it was originally called the \"Arch Ward Memorial Award\" in honor of Arch Ward, the man who conceived of the All-Star Game in 1933. The award's name was changed to the \"Commissioner's Trophy\" in 1970 (two National League (NL) players were presented the award in 1975), but this name change was reversed in 1985 when the World Series Trophy was renamed the Commissioner's Trophy. Finally, the trophy was renamed the Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award in 2002, in honor of former Boston Red Sox player Ted Williams, who had died earlier that year.[1] No award was presented for the 2002 All-Star Game, which ended in a tie.[2] Thus, the Anaheim Angels' Garret Anderson was the first recipient of the newly named Ted Williams Award in 2003. The All-Star Game Most Valuable Player also receives a Chevrolet vehicle, choosing between two cars.[3]","image":"Willie_Mays_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game_Most_Valuable_Player_Award"}
