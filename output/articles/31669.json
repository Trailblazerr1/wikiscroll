{"title":"Neorealism (international relations)","summary":"Neorealism or structural realism is a theory of international relations that emphasizes the role of power politics in international relations, sees competition and conflict as enduring features, and sees limited potential for cooperation.[1] The anarchic state of the international system means that states cannot be certain of other states' intentions and their own security, thus prompting them to engage in power politics.","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp"}
