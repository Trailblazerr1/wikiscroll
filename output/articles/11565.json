{"title":"Crown (dental restoration)","summary":"In dentistry, a crown most commonly refers to a dental cap, a type of dental restoration that completely caps or encircles a tooth or dental implant. A crown may be needed when a large cavity threatens the health of a tooth.[1] A crown is typically bonded to the tooth by dental cement. They can be made from various materials, which are usually fabricated using indirect methods. Crowns are used to improve the strength or appearance of teeth and to halt deterioration. While beneficial to dental health, the procedure and materials can be costly.","image":"Frontzahnkronen_Unterkiefer_20100304_007.JPG.webp","url":"Crown_(dental_restoration)"}
