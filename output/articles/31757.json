{"title":"Neurotoxin","summary":"Neurotoxins are toxins that are destructive to nerve tissue (causing neurotoxicity).[3] Neurotoxins are an extensive class of exogenous chemical neurological insults[4] that can adversely affect function in both developing and mature nervous tissue.[5] The term can also be used to classify endogenous compounds, which, when abnormally contacted, can prove neurologically toxic.[4] Though neurotoxins are often neurologically destructive, their ability to specifically target neural components is important in the study of nervous systems.[6] Common examples of neurotoxins include lead,[7] ethanol (drinking alcohol),[8] glutamate,[9] nitric oxide,[10] botulinum toxin (e.g. Botox),[11] tetanus toxin,[12] and tetrodotoxin.[6] Some substances such as nitric oxide and glutamate are in fact essential for proper function of the body and only exert neurotoxic effects at excessive concentrations.","image":"Cyanobacterial_Scum.JPG.webp"}
