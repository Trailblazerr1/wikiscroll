{"title":"Edgar Cayce","summary":"Edgar Cayce (/ˈkeɪsiː/; 18 March 1877 – 3 January 1945) was an American clairvoyant who claimed to channel from his higher self.[1] Cayce's sessions occurred during a trance state when he would fall asleep. His friend Al Layne, his wife, and later his secretary Gladys Davis Turner, would record his words. During these sessions, Cayce would answer questions on subjects as varied as healing, reincarnation, dreams, the afterlife, past-life, nutrition, Atlantis and future events. As a devout Christian and Sunday school teacher, his prophesying claims were a source of trouble for him because channeling was typically criticized by practitioners of his faith as being demonic. Cayce, in contrast, believed that it was his subconscious mind exploring the dream realm, where he believed minds were timelessly connected. Cayce founded a nonprofit organization, the Association for Research and Enlightenment,[2] to store and facilitate the study of his channelings, as well as run a hospital. A biographer gave him the nickname The Sleeping Prophet.[3]","image":"Cayce_1910.jpg.webp","url":"Edgar_Cayce"}
