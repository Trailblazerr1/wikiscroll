{"title":"Aortic stenosis","summary":"Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result.[1] It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level.[1] It typically gets worse over time.[1] Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first.[1] If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse.[1] Loss of consciousness typically occurs with standing or exercising.[1] Signs of heart failure include shortness of breath especially when lying down, at night, or with exercise, and swelling of the legs.[1] Thickening of the valve without narrowing is known as aortic sclerosis.[1]","image":"Aortic_stenosis_rheumatic%2C_gross_pathology_20G0014_lores.jpg.webp"}
