{"title":"Transcendentalism","summary":"Transcendentalism is a philosophical movement that developed in the late 1820s and 1830s in New England. [1][2][3] A core belief is in the inherent goodness of people and nature,[1] and while society and its institutions have corrupted the purity of the individual, people are at their best when truly \"self-reliant\" and independent. Transcendentalists saw divine experience inherent in the everyday, rather than believing in a distant heaven. Transcendentalists saw physical and spiritual phenomena as part of dynamic processes rather than discrete entities.","image":"Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_ca1857.jpg.webp"}
