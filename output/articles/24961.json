{"title":"Knot theory","summary":"In the mathematical field of topology, knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life, such as those in shoelaces and rope, a mathematical knot differs in that the ends are joined so it cannot be undone, the simplest knot being a ring (or \"unknot\"). In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}}\n  \n (in topology, a circle isn't bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}}\n  \n upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting it or passing through itself.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg"}
