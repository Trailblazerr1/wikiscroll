{"title":"Eucharist in the Catholic Church","summary":"Eucharist (from εὐχαριστία, \"thanksgiving\") here refers to Holy Communion or the Body and Blood of Christ, which is consumed during the Catholic Mass or Eucharistic Celebration. \"At the Last Supper, on the night he was betrayed, our Savior instituted the Eucharistic sacrifice of his Body and Blood, ... a memorial of his death and resurrection: a sacrament of love, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a Paschal banquet 'in which Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a pledge of future glory is given to us.'\"[1] As such, Eucharist is \"an action of thanksgiving to God\" derived from \"the Jewish blessings that proclaim – especially during a meal – God's works: creation, redemption, and sanctification.\"[2]","image":"Ecce_Agnus_Dei.jpg.webp"}
