{"title":"Essential oil","summary":"An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile (easily evaporated at normal temperatures) chemical compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as volatile oils, ethereal oils, aetheroleum, or simply as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted, such as oil of clove. An essential oil is \"essential\" in the sense that it contains the \"essence of\" the plant's fragranceâ€”the characteristic fragrance of the plant from which it is derived.[1] The term \"essential\" used here does not mean indispensable or usable by the human body, as with the terms essential amino acid or essential fatty acid, which are so called because they are nutritionally required by a given living organism.[2]","image":"SandalwoodEssOil.png.webp","url":"Essential_oil"}
