{"title":"Syngman Rhee","summary":"Syngman Rhee (Korean: 이승만, pronounced [i.sɯŋ.man];[note 1] 26 March 1875 – 19 July 1965) was a South Korean politician[1] who served as the first president of South Korea from 1948 to 1960. Rhee was also the first and last president of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea from 1919 to his impeachment in 1925 and from 1947 to 1948. As President of South Korea, Rhee's government was characterised by authoritarianism, limited economic development, and in the late 1950s growing political instability and public opposition. Authoritarianism continued in South Korea after Rhee's resignation until 1988, except for a few short breaks.","image":"Rhee_Syng-Man_in_1948.jpg.webp","url":"Syngman_Rhee"}
