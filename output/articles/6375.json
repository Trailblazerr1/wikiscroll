{"title":"Bethel","summary":"Bethel (Ugaritic: bt il, meaning \"House of El\" or \"House of God\",[1] Hebrew: בֵּית אֵל‎ Bēṯ ’Ēl, also transliterated Beth El, Beth-El, Beit El; Greek: Βαιθήλ; Latin: Bethel) is the name of a place (a toponym) often used in the Hebrew Bible. It is first mentioned in Genesis 12:8 as being near where Abram pitched his tent. Later in Genesis, it is the location where Jacob dreamt of seeing angels and God, and which he therefore named Bethel, \"House of God.\" The name is further used for a border city located between the territory of the Israelite tribe of Benjamin and that of the tribe of Ephraim, which first belonged to the Benjaminites and was later conquered by the Ephraimites.","image":"Bethel%2C_72.Holy_land_photographed._Daniel_B._Shepp._1894-1.jpg.webp","url":"Bethel"}
