{"title":"Southern Ocean","summary":"The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean,[1][note 4] comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica.[4] As such, it is regarded as the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean.[5] Over the past 30 years, the Southern Ocean has been subject to rapid climate change, which has led to changes in the marine ecosystem.[6]","image":"Location_Southern_Ocean.svg.png.webp"}
