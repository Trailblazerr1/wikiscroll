{"title":"Fish fin","summary":"Fins are distinctive anatomical features composed of bony spines or rays protruding from the body of a fish. They are covered with skin and joined together either in a webbed fashion, as seen in most bony fish, or similar to a flipper, as seen in sharks.  Apart from the tail or caudal fin, fish fins have no direct connection with the spine and are supported only by muscles. Their principal function is to help the fish swim.","image":"Lampanyctodes_hectoris_(fins).png.webp","url":"Fish_fin"}
