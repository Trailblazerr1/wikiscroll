{"title":"Efficient energy use","summary":"Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called energy efficiency, is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services and can also reduce effects of air pollution. For example, insulating a building allows it to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a thermal comfort. Installing light-emitting diode bulbs, fluorescent lighting, or natural skylight windows reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional incandescent light bulbs. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process[2] or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.","image":"Energy_intensity_of_economies%2C_OWID.svg.png.webp","url":"Efficient_energy_use"}
