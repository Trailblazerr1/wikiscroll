{"title":"Paracetamol","summary":"Paracetamol,  also known as acetaminophen[lower-alpha 1], is a medication used to treat fever and mild to moderate pain.[11][12] At a standard dose, paracetamol only slightly decreases body temperature;[11][13][14] it is inferior to ibuprofen in that respect,[15] and the benefits of its use for fever are unclear.[11][16][17] Paracetamol may relieve pain in acute mild migraine but only slightly in episodic tension headache.[18][19] However, the aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination helps with both conditions where the pain is mild and is recommended as a first-line treatment for them.[20][21] Paracetamol is effective for post-surgical pain, but it is inferior to ibuprofen.[22] The paracetamol/ibuprofen combination provides further increase in potency and is superior to either drug alone.[22][23] The pain relief paracetamol provides in osteoarthritis is small and clinically insignificant.[12][24][25] The evidence in its favor for the use in low back pain, cancer pain and neuropathic pain is insufficient.[12][26][24][27][28][29]","image":"Paracetamol-skeletal.svg.png.webp"}
