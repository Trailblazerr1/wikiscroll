{"title":"Lascaux","summary":"Lascaux (English: /læˈskoʊ/ la-SKOH,[1] US also /lɑːˈskoʊ/ lah-SKOH;[2] French: Grotte de Lascaux [ɡʁɔt də lasko],[3] \"Lascaux Cave\") is a network of caves near the village of Montignac, in the department of Dordogne in southwestern France. Over 600 parietal wall paintings cover the interior walls and ceilings of the cave. The paintings represent primarily large animals, typical local contemporary fauna that correspond with the fossil record of the Upper Paleolithic in the area. They are the combined effort of many generations and, with continued debate, the age of the paintings is now usually estimated at around 17,000 years (early Magdalenian).[4][5][6] Because of the outstanding prehistoric art in the cave, Lascaux was inducted into the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979, as an element of the Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley.[7]","image":"Lascaux_painting.jpg.webp","url":"Lascaux"}
