{"title":"Linear independence","summary":"In the theory of vector spaces,  a set of vectors is said to be linearly dependent if there is a nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector. If no such linear combination exists, then the vectors are said to be linearly independent. These concepts are central to the definition of dimension.[1]","image":"Vec-indep.png.webp","url":"Linear_independence"}
