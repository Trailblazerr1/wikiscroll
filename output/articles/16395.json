{"title":"Flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","summary":"The flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a Canadian pale triband consisting of blue, gold, and green bands charged with three green diamonds at the centre.  Adopted in 1985 to replace a similar design used from the time of independence, it has been the flag of Saint Vincent since that year.  The design of the present flag entailed substituting the country's coat of arms on a breadfruit leaf with the diamonds. They are a reference to both the letter \"V\", which is the first letter of the country's name, and its nickname as the \"Gems of the Antilles\" and \"Jewels of the Caribbean\".  Accordingly, the flag itself has been given the moniker of \"The Gems\".","image":"Flag_of_Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines.svg.png.webp"}
