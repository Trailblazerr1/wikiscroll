Traces of Neolithic settlement was found on the present site. It was an important crossing point of the Seine, and meeting point of land and water trade routes. In the 1st century BCE, it was conquered by Romans and was gradually rebuilt into a Roman city.  Monumental remains, including a forum, amphitheater, and Roman baths still remain. In the 5th century it became the capital of the Merovingian dynasty of French Kings, and thereafter was known simply as \"Paris\".","image":"Paris-crypte-02.jpg.webp","url":"Lutetia"}
