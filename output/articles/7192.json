{"title":"Bongo drum","summary":"Bongos (Spanish: bong√≥) are an Afro-Cuban percussion instrument consisting of a pair of small open bottomed hand drums of different sizes. They are struck with both hands, most commonly in an eight-stroke pattern called martillo (hammer). They are mainly employed in the rhythm section of son cubano and salsa ensembles, often alongside other drums such as the larger congas and the stick-struck timbales.","image":"Bongo.jpg.webp","url":"Bongo_drum"}
