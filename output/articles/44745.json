{"title":"The Weekly Standard","summary":"The Weekly Standard was an American political magazine of news, analysis and commentary, published 48 times per year. Originally edited by founders Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes, the Standard had been described as a \"redoubt of neoconservatism\" and as \"the neocon bible.\"[2][3] Its founding publisher, News Corporation, debuted the title on September 18, 1995.[4] In 2009, News Corporation sold the magazine to a subsidiary of the Anschutz Corporation.[5] On December 14, 2018, its owners announced that the magazine was ceasing publication, with the last issue published on December 17.[6] Sources attribute its demise to an increasing divergence between Kristol and other editors' shift towards anti-Trump positions, and the magazine's audience's shift towards Trumpism.[7]","image":"The_Weekly_Standard_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"The_Weekly_Standard"}
