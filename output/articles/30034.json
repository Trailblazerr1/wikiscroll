{"title":"Minicomputer","summary":"A minicomputer, or colloquially mini, is a class of smaller general purpose computers that developed in the mid-1960s[1][2] and sold for much less than mainframe[3] and mid-size computers from IBM and its direct competitors. In a 1970 survey, The New York Times suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than US$25,000 (equivalent to $167,000 in 2020), with an input-output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory, that is capable of running programs in a higher level language, such as Fortran or BASIC.[4]","image":"PDP-8.jpg.webp","url":"Minicomputer"}
