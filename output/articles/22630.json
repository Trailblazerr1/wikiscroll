{"title":"Italianate architecture","summary":"The Italianate style was a distinct 19th-century phase in the history of Classical architecture. In the Italianate style, the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture, which had served as inspiration for both Palladianism and Neoclassicism, were synthesised with picturesque aesthetics. The style of architecture that was thus created, though also characterised as \"Neo-Renaissance\", was essentially of its own time. \"The backward look transforms its object,\" Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles;[2] \"every spectator at every period—at every moment, indeed—inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature.\"","image":"Osborne-iow-3Ja10-10914.jpg.webp","url":"Italianate_architecture"}
