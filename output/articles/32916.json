{"title":"Om mani padme hum","summary":"Oṃ maṇi padme hūṃ[1] (Sanskrit: ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ, IPA: [õːː mɐɳɪ pɐdmeː ɦũː]) is the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. It first appeared in the Mahayana Kāraṇḍavyūhasūtra where it is also referred to as the sadaksara (six syllabled) and the paramahrdaya, or “innermost heart” of Avalokiteshvara.[2] In this text the mantra is seen as the condensed form of all Buddhist teachings.[3]","image":"KARMANSIN(1828)_p1.387_Schriftproben.jpg.webp"}
