{"title":"Slavery Abolition Act 1833","summary":"The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (3 & 4 Will. IV c. 73) provided for the immediate abolition of slavery in most parts of the British Empire. This Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom expanded the jurisdiction of the Slave Trade Act 1807 and made the purchase or ownership of slaves illegal within the British Empire, with the exception of \"the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company\", Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and Saint Helena. The Act was repealed in 1997 as a part of wider rationalisation of English statute law; however, later anti-slavery legislation remains in force.","image":"Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(HM_Government).svg.png.webp"}
