{"title":"SMS Moltke","summary":"SMS Moltke[lower-alpha 1] was the lead ship of the  Moltke-class battlecruisers of the German Imperial Navy, named after the 19th-century German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke. Commissioned on 30 September 1911, the ship was the second battlecruiser of the Imperial Navy. Moltke, along with her sister ship Goeben, was an enlarged version of the previous German battlecruiser design, Von der Tann, with increased armor protection and two more main guns in an additional turret. Compared to her British rivals—the  Indefatigable class—Moltke and her sister Goeben were significantly larger and better armored.[lower-alpha 2]","image":"SMS_Moltke_Hampton_Roads_1912_FINAL.jpg.webp"}
