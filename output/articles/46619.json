{"title":"Unionism in Ireland","summary":"Unionism in Ireland is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the Crown and constitution of the United Kingdom. Once the overwhelming sentiment of a then-ascendant minority Protestant population, in the decades following Catholic Emancipation (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an Irish parliament. In the century since Partition (1921), as Ulster Unionism its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties that constitute Northern Ireland. Within the framework of a peace settlement for Northern Ireland, since 1998 unionists have had to accommodate Irish nationalists in a devolved administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.","image":"Ulster's_Prayer_1912.jpg.webp"}
