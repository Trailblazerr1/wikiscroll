{"title":"Karl Popper","summary":"Sir Karl Raimund Popper CH FRS FBA[9] (28 July 1902 â€“ 17 September 1994) was an Austrian-British[10] philosopher, academic and social commentator.[11][12][13] One of the 20th century's most influential philosophers of science,[14][15][16] Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. According to Popper, a theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can (and should) be scrutinised with decisive experiments. Popper was opposed to the classical justificationist account of knowledge, which he replaced with critical rationalism, namely \"the first non-justificational philosophy of criticism in the history of philosophy\".[17]","image":"Karl_Popper.jpg.webp"}
