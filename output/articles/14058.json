{"title":"Eastern world","summary":"Eastern world, also known as the East or the Orient, is an umbrella term for various cultures or social structures, nations and philosophical systems, which vary depending on the context. It most often includes at least part of Asia or, geographically, the countries and cultures east of Europe, the Mediterranean region and the Arab world, specifically in historical (pre-modern) contexts, and in modern times in the context of Orientalism.[1] It is often seen as a counterpart to the Western world, and correlates strongly to the southern half of the Northâ€“South divide.","image":"lossy-page1-290px-Modern_Asia_(1796).tif.jpg.webp","url":"Eastern_world"}
