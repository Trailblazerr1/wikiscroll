Vuelve is a Latin record with Latin dance numbers and pop ballads. \"María\" caught the attention of FIFA, who asked Martin to write an anthem for the 1998 FIFA World Cup being held in France. Martin subsequently recorded \"La Copa de la Vida\", composed by Porter, Rosa, and Desmond Child for the World Cup.","image":"Vuelve.png.webp","url":"Vuelve_(album)"}
