{"title":"Polycystic kidney disease","summary":"Polycystic kidney disease (PKD or PCKD, also known as polycystic kidney syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which the renal tubules become structurally abnormal, resulting in the development and growth of multiple cysts within the kidney.[5] These cysts may begin to develop in utero, in infancy, in childhood, or in adulthood.[6] Cysts are non-functioning tubules filled with fluid pumped into them, which range in size from microscopic to enormous, crushing adjacent normal tubules and eventually rendering them non-functional as well.","image":"Polycystic_kidneys%2C_gross_pathology_CDC_PHIL.png.webp","url":"Polycystic_kidney_disease"}
