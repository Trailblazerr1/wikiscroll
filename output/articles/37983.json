{"title":"Rijeka","summary":"Rijeka (/riˈɛkə, riˈeɪkə/ ree-EH-kə ree-AY-kə, also US: /riˈjɛkə/ ree-YEH-kə,[2][3] Croatian: [rijěːka] (listen); Hungarian: Fiume, Italian: Fiume [ˈfjuːme]; Slovene: Reka; German: Sankt Veit am Flaum) is the principal seaport and the third-largest city in Croatia (after Zagreb and Split). It is located in Primorje-Gorski Kotar County on Kvarner Bay, an inlet of the Adriatic Sea and in 2011 had a population of 128,624 inhabitants.[1] Historically, because of its strategic position and its excellent deep-water port, the city was fiercely contested, especially between Italy, Hungary (serving as the Kingdom of Hungary's largest and most important port), and Croatia, changing rulers and demographics many times over centuries. According to the 2011 census data, the majority of its citizens are Croats, along with small numbers of Serbs, Bosniaks and Italians.","image":"Rijeka_Riva.jpg.webp","url":"Rijeka"}
