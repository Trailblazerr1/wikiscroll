{"title":"Multiplayer video game","summary":"A multiplayer video game is a video game in which more than one person can play in the same game environment at the same time, either locally and on the same computing system (e.g. New Super Mario Bros. Wii), locally and on different computing systems via a local area network, or via a wide area network, most commonly the Internet (e.g. World of Warcraft, Call of Duty). Multiplayer games usually require players to share a single game system or use networking technology to play together over a greater distance; players may compete against one or more human contestants, work cooperatively with a human partner to achieve a common goal, or supervise other players' activity. Due to multiplayer games allowing players to interact with other individuals, they provide an element of social communication absent from single-player games.","image":"Lyon_E-Sport_9_-_Palais_des_sports_de_Lyon_-_LAN_party_(detail).jpg.webp"}
