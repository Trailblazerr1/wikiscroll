{"title":"Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant","summary":"The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (福島第一原子力発電所, Fukushima Daiichi Genshiryoku Hatsudensho, Fukushima I NPP) is a disabled nuclear power plant located on a 3.5-square-kilometre (860-acre) site[1] in the towns of Ōkuma and Futaba in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The plant suffered major damage from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan on March 11, 2011. The chain of events caused radiation leaks and permanently damaged several reactors, making them impossible to restart. By political decision, the remaining reactors were not restarted.","image":"Fukushima_Daiichi_04780015_(8388174045).jpg.webp","url":"Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant"}
