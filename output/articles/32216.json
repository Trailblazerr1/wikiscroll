{"title":"No Strings Attached (NSYNC album)","summary":"No Strings Attached is the third studio album by American boy band NSYNC. It was released by Jive Records on March 21, 2000. Looking to distinguish their music from that of their labelmates, NSYNC chose to incorporate pop and R&B styles. Prior to the release of the album, the band separated from their management Trans Continental and their label RCA Records; its title is a play on the idea of independence from corporate control. Contributions to the album's production came from a wide range of producers, including NSYNC members Justin Timberlake and JC Chasez, and collaborators including Kristian Lundin, Jake Schulze, Rami, Teddy Riley, Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, Richard Marx, Veit Renn, Babyface, and Guy Roche.","image":"Nsync_-_No_Strings_Attached.png.webp","url":"No_Strings_Attached_(NSYNC_album)"}
