{"title":"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan","summary":"The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the third studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on September 29, 1987 by EMI Manhattan. Due to prior obligations resulting in temporary personnel changes following the band's formation in 1983, The Uplift Mofo Party Plan is the only studio album to feature all four founding members of the band on every track: vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. This is also the last album with Slovak before his death from a drug overdose in 1988, and the only full-length album to feature Irons. \"Fight Like a Brave\" was released as the album's only single, although \"Me and My Friends\" received minor radio airplay. In 1992, \"Behind the Sun\" was released as a single and music video to promote What Hits!?.","image":"UpliftMofoCover.jpg.webp"}
