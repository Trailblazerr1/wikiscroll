{"title":"Imagine (John Lennon song)","summary":"\"Imagine\" is a song by English rock musician John Lennon from his 1971 album of the same name. The best-selling single of his solo career, the lyrics encourage listeners to imagine a world of peace, without materialism, without borders separating nations and without religion. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's lyrics and content came from his wife, Yoko Ono, and in 2017 the process to give Yoko co-writing credit (while not yet confirmed),[2] was already under way.[3]","image":"Lennon_Imagine_Sleeve_1975.jpg.webp"}
