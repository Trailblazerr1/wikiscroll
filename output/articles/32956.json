{"title":"Oncovirus","summary":"An oncovirus or oncogenic virus is a virus that can cause cancer.[4] This term originated from studies of acutely transforming retroviruses in the 1950â€“60s,[5] when the term \"oncornaviruses\" was used to denote their RNA virus origin.[6] With the letters \"RNA\" removed, it now refers to any virus with a DNA or RNA genome causing cancer and is synonymous with \"tumor virus\" or \"cancer virus\". The vast majority of human and animal viruses do not cause cancer, probably because of longstanding co-evolution between the virus and its host. Oncoviruses have been important not only in epidemiology, but also in investigations of cell cycle control mechanisms such as the retinoblastoma protein.","image":"PrevalenceHepB2014.png.webp"}
