{"title":"Jacket","summary":"A jacket is a garment for the upper body, usually extending below the hips.[1] A jacket typically has sleeves, and fastens in the front or slightly on the side. A jacket is generally lighter, tighter-fitting, and less insulating than a coat, which is outerwear. Some jackets are fashionable, while others serve as protective clothing. Jackets without sleeves are vests.","image":"Jacket2-1.jpg.webp"}
