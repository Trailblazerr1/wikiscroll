{"title":"Erie Canal","summary":"The Erie Canal is a canal that traverses east–west through upstate New York, eastern United States, as part of the cross-state route of the New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal). It was built to create a navigable water route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes Basin, originally stretching for 584 kilometres (363 mi) from the Hudson River at Albany to Lake Erie in Buffalo. Completed in 1825, it was the second-longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly enhanced the development and economy of many major cities of New York, including New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, as well as the United States.[2] This was in part due to the new ease of transporting salt and other necessity goods, and industries that developed around those.[3][4]","image":"7c3e293f2ec42c4f20e22b722983d433.png.webp","url":"Erie_Canal"}
