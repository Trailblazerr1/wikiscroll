{"title":"Doom (2016 video game)","summary":"Doom is a 2016 first-person shooter game developed by id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the first major installment in the series since Doom 3 (2004). Players take the role of an unnamed space marine, known as the Doom Slayer, as he battles demonic forces from Hell that have been unleashed by the Union Aerospace Corporation within their energy-mining facility on Mars. The gameplay returns to a faster pace with more open-ended levels, closer to the first two games than the slower survival horror approach of Doom 3. It also features environment traversal, character upgrades, and the ability to perform executions known as \"glory kills\".","image":"Doom_Cover.jpg.webp","url":"Doom_(2016_video_game)"}
