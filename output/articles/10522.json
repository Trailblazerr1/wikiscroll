{"title":"Colloid","summary":"A colloid is a mixture in which one substance consisting of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. However, some definitions specify that the particles must be dispersed in a liquid,[1] and others extend the definition to include substances like aerosols and gels. The term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower sense of the word suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). A colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). The dispersed phase particles have a diameter of approximately 1 nanometre to 1 micrometre.[2][3]","image":"SEM_Image_of_Colloidal_Particles.jpg.webp","url":"Colloid"}
