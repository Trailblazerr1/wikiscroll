{"title":"Comparative advantage","summary":"In an economic model, agents have a comparative advantage over others in producing a particular good if they can produce that good at a lower relative opportunity cost or autarky price, i.e. at a lower relative marginal cost prior to trade.[1] Comparative advantage describes the economic reality of the work gains from trade for individuals, firms, or nations, which arise from differences in their factor endowments or technological progress.[2] (The absolute advantage, comparing output per time (labor efficiency) or per quantity of input material (monetary efficiency), is generally considered more intuitive, but less accurate - as long as the opportunity costs of producing goods across countries vary, productive trade is possible.[3])","image":"David_ricardo.jpg.webp","url":"Comparative_advantage"}
