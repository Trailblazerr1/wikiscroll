{"title":"Respiratory sounds","summary":"Respiratory sounds, also known as lung sounds or breath sounds, refer to the specific sounds generated by the movement of air through the respiratory system.[1] These may be easily audible or identified through auscultation of the respiratory system through the lung fields with a stethoscope as well as from the spectral characteristics of lung sounds.[2] These include normal breath sounds and adventitious or \"added\" sounds such as crackles, wheezes, pleural friction rubs, stertor, and stridor.","image":"Thoracic_landmarks_anterior_view_lung_ausc.svg.png.webp","url":"Respiratory_sounds"}
