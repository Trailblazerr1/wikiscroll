{"title":"Piazza San Marco","summary":"Piazza San Marco (Italian pronunciation: [ˈpjattsa sam ˈmarko]; Venetian: Piasa San Marco), often known in English as St Mark's Square, is the principal public square of Venice, Italy, where it is generally known just as la Piazza (\"the Square\"). All other urban spaces in the city (except the Piazzetta and the Piazzale Roma) are called campi (\"fields\"). The Piazzetta (\"little Piazza/Square\") is an extension of the Piazza towards San Marco basin in its south east corner (see plan). The two spaces together form the social, religious and political centre of Venice and are commonly considered together.
