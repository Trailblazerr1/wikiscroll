{"title":"Bluetooth","summary":"Bluetooth  is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz, and building personal area networks (PANs).[3] It was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.  It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections, to exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect cell phones and music players with wireless headphones. In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 milliwatts, giving it a very short range of up to 10 meters (30 feet).","image":"BluetoothLogo.svg.png.webp"}
