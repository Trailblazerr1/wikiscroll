{"title":"CN Tower","summary":"The CN Tower (French: Tour CN) is a 553.3 m-high (1,815.3 ft) concrete communications and observation tower located in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[5][8] Built on the former Railway Lands, it was completed in 1976. Its name \"CN\" originally referred to Canadian National, the railway company that built the tower. Following the railway's decision to divest non-core freight railway assets prior to the company's privatization in 1995, it transferred the tower to the Canada Lands Company, a federal Crown corporation responsible for real estate development.","image":"Toronto_-_ON_-_Toronto_Harbourfront7.jpg.webp"}
