{"title":"Microcode","summary":"In processor design, microcode is a technique that interposes a layer of computer organization between the CPU hardware and the programmer-visible instruction set architecture of the computer.[1] Microcode is a layer of hardware-level instructions that implement higher-level machine code instructions or internal state machine sequencing in many digital processing elements. Microcode is used in general-purpose central processing units, although in current desktop CPUs, it is only a fallback path for cases that the faster hardwired control unit cannot handle.[2]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
