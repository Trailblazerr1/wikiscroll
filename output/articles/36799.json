{"title":"Quicksort","summary":"Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961,[2] it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be somewhat faster than merge sort and about two or three times faster than heapsort.[3]","image":"Sorting_quicksort_anim.gif","url":"Quicksort"}
