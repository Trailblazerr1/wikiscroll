{"title":"Grand Mosque seizure","summary":"The Grand Mosque seizure occurred during November and December 1979 when extremist insurgents calling for the overthrow of the House of Saud took over Masjid al-Haram, the holiest mosque in Islam, in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The insurgents declared that the Mahdi (the \"redeemer of Islam\") had arrived in the form of one of their leaders – Mohammed Abdullah al-Qahtani – and called on Muslims to obey him. The Saudi army, advised by French commandos, fought for almost two weeks to reclaim the Grand Mosque.","image":"Saudi_soldiers%2C_Mecca%2C_1979.JPG.webp"}
