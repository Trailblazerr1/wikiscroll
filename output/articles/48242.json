{"title":"West Jerusalem","summary":"West Jerusalem or Western Jerusalem (Arabic: القدس الغربية‎, al-Quds al-Ḡarbiyya; Hebrew: מערב ירושלים‎, Ma'aráv Yerushalayim) refers to the sectors of Jerusalem that remained under Israeli control after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, whose ceasefire lines delimited the boundary with the rest of the city, which was then under Jordanian control.[1] A number of western countries such as the United Kingdom acknowledge de facto Israeli authority, but withhold de jure recognition.[2][3] Israel's claim of sovereignty over West Jerusalem is more widely accepted than its claim over East Jerusalem.[4]","image":"JerusalemEastAndWest.jpg.webp"}
