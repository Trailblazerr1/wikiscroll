{"title":"Kosta Pećanac","summary":"Konstantin \"Kosta\" Milovanović Pećanac (Serbian Cyrillic: Константин Коста Миловановић Пећанац; 1879–1944) was a Serbian and Yugoslav Chetnik commander (vojvoda) during the Balkan Wars, World War I and World War II. Pećanac fought on the Serbian side in both Balkan Wars and World War I, joining the forces of Kosta Vojinović during the Toplica uprising of 1917. Between the wars he was an important leader of Chetnik veteran associations, and was known for his strong hostility to the Yugoslav Communist Party, which made him popular in conservative circles. As president of the Chetnik Association during the 1930s, he transformed it into an aggressively partisan Serb political organisation with over half a million members. During World War II, Pećanac collaborated with both the German military administration and their puppet government in the German-occupied territory of Serbia.[1]","image":"Kosta_Pećanac_portrait.jpg.webp","url":"Kosta_Pećanac"}
