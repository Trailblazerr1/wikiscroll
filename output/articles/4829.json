{"title":"Atmosphere","summary":"An atmosphere (from Ancient Greek  ἀτμός (atmós) 'vapour, steam', and  σφαῖρα (sphaîra) 'sphere') is a layer of gas or layers of gases that envelope a planet, and is held in place by the gravity of the planetary body. A planet retains an atmosphere when the gravity is great and the temperature of the atmosphere is low.[1] A stellar atmosphere is the outer region of a star, which includes the layers above the opaque photosphere; stars of low temperature might have outer atmospheres containing compound molecules.","image":"Mars_atmosphere.jpg.webp"}
