{"title":"Control of fire by early humans","summary":"The control of fire by early humans was a turning point in the technological evolution of human civilization. Fire provided a source of warmth and lighting, protection from predators (especially at night), a way to create more advanced hunting tools, and a method for cooking food. These cultural advances allowed human geographic dispersal, cultural innovations, and changes to diet and behavior. Additionally, creating fire allowed human activity to continue into the dark and colder hours of the evening.","image":"Zhoukoudian_Caves_July2004.jpg.webp","url":"Control_of_fire_by_early_humans"}
