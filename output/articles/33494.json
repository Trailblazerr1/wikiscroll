{"title":"Overseas France","summary":"Overseas France (French: France d'outre-mer, l'Outre-mer, or colloquially les DOM-TOM) consists of thirteen French-administered territories outside Europe, mostly remains of the French colonial empire that chose to remain a part of the French state under various statuses after decolonization. This collective name is used in everyday life in France but is not an administrative designation in its own right. Indeed, the five overseas regions have exactly the same administrative status as the metropolitan regions while the five overseas collectivities are semi-autonomous and New Caledonia is an autonomous territory. Overseas France includes island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, French Guiana on the South American continent, and several peri-Antarctic islands as well as a claim in Antarctica. Excluding the district of Adélie Land, where French sovereignty is effective de jure by French law, but where the French exclusive claim on this part of Antarctica is frozen by the Antarctic Treaty (signed in 1959), overseas France covers a land area of 119,396 km2 (46,099 sq mi) and accounts for 18.0% of the French Republic's land territory.[1] Its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 9,825,538 km2 (3,793,661 sq mi) accounts for 96.7% of the EEZ of the French Republic.[2]","image":"Flag_of_France_(1794–1815%2C_1830–1958).svg.png.webp"}
