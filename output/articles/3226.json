{"title":"American Dream","summary":"The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States, the set of ideals (democracy, rights, liberty, opportunity and equality) in which freedom includes the opportunity for prosperity and success, as well as an upward social mobility for the family and children, achieved through hard work in a society with few barriers. The term \"American Dream\" was coined by James Truslow Adams in 1931, saying that \"life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement\" regardless of social class or circumstances of birth.[1]","image":"Statueofliberty.JPG.webp","url":"American_Dream"}
