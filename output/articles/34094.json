{"title":"Path integral formulation","summary":"The path integral formulation is a description in quantum mechanics that generalizes the action principle of classical mechanics.  It replaces the classical notion of a single, unique classical trajectory for a system with a sum, or functional integral, over an infinity of quantum-mechanically possible trajectories to compute a quantum amplitude.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Path_integral_formulation"}
