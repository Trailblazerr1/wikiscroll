{"title":"Antisocial personality disorder","summary":"Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD or infrequently APD) is a personality disorder characterized by a long-term pattern of disregard for, or violation of, the rights of others as well as a difficulty sustaining long term relationships.[3] A weak or nonexistent conscience is often apparent, as well as a history of rule-breaking that can sometimes lead to law-breaking, a tendency towards substance abuse,[3] and impulsive and aggressive behaviour.[4][5] Antisocial behaviors often have their onset before the age of 8, and in nearly 80% of ASPD cases, the subject will develop their first symptoms by age 11.[6] The Prevalence of ASPD peaks in people age 24 to 44 years old, and often decreases in people age 45 to 64 years.[6] In the United States, the rate of antisocial personality disorder in the general population is estimated between 0.2 and 3.3 percent.[7] However, settings can greatly influence the prevalence of ASPD. In a study by Donald W. Black MD, a random sampling of 320 newly incarcerated offenders found ASPD was present in over 35 percent of those surveyed.[8]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Antisocial_personality_disorder"}
