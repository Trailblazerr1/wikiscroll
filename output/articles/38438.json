{"title":"Romanticism","summary":"Romanticism (also known as the Romantic era) was an artistic, literary, musical, and intellectual movement that originated in Europe towards the end of the 18th century, and in most areas was at its peak in the approximate period from 1800 to 1850. Romanticism was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature, preferring the medieval rather than the classical.   It was partly a reaction to the Industrial Revolution,[1] the social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, and the scientific rationalization of natureâ€”all components of modernity.[2] It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, and literature, but had a major impact on historiography,[3] education,[4] chess, social sciences, and the natural sciences.[5]  It had a significant and complex effect on politics, with romantic thinkers influencing conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and most notably, nationalism.[6]","image":"Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg.webp"}
