{"title":"IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry","summary":"In chemical nomenclature, the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry is a method of naming organic chemical compounds as recommended[1] by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). It is published in the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry (informally called the Blue Book). Ideally, every possible organic compound should have a name from which an unambiguous structural formula can be created. There is also an IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry.","image":"IUPAC_naming_example_with_carbons.png.webp","url":"IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry"}
