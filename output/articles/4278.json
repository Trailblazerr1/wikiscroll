{"title":"Archer (2009 TV series)","summary":"Archer is an American adult animated sitcom created by Adam Reed for FX. The show follows the exploits of a dysfunctional intelligence agency, centered on Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) and seven of his colleaguesâ€”his mother Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell), Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer), Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Ray Gillette (Adam Reed) and Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates). The show is set in an anachronistic, Cold War-esque universe and parodies espionage, culture and society, and the human condition. Archer is distinguished by artistic reinvention in contemporary episodes, foregoing the standard setup of a workplace sitcom to that of self-contained anthologies. It returned to its spy parody roots post-tenth season.","image":"Archer_2009_TV_series_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Archer_(2009_TV_series)"}
