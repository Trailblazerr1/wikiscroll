{"title":"The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)","summary":"The Last Judgment (Italian: Il Giudizio Universale)[1] is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo covering the whole altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. It is a depiction of the Second Coming of Christ and the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. The dead rise and descend to their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent saints. Altogether there are over 300 figures, with nearly all the males and angels originally shown as nudes; many were later partly covered up by painted draperies, of which some remain after recent cleaning and restoration. The Last Judgment painting is worth $540 million","image":"Last_Judgement_(Michelangelo).jpg.webp"}
