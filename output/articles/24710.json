{"title":"Khoekhoe","summary":"Khoekhoen (singular Khoekhoe)[lower-alpha 1] (or Khoikhoi in the former orthography; formerly also Hottentots[2]) are the traditionally nomadic pastoralist indigenous population of southwestern Africa. They are often grouped with the hunter-gatherer San (literally \"Foragers\") peoples.[3] The designation \"Khoekhoe\" is actually a kare or praise address, not an ethnic endonym, but it has been used in the literature as an ethnic term for Khoe-speaking peoples of Southern Africa, particularly pastoralist groups, such as the !Ora, !Gona, Nama, Xiri and ǂNūkhoe nations.","image":"Sameul_Daniell_-_Kora-Khokhoi_preparing_to_move_-_1805.jpg.webp"}
