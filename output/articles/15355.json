{"title":"European Golden Shoe","summary":"The European Golden Shoe, also known as European Golden Boot, is an award that is presented each season to the leading goalscorer in league matches from the top division of every European national league. The trophy is a sculpture of a football boot. From its inception in the 1967–68 season, the award, originally called \"Soulier d'Or\", which translates from French as Golden Shoe or Boot, has been given to the top goalscorer in all European leagues during a season. Since 1997, it has been calculated using a weighting in favour of the highest ranked leagues. Originally presented by L'Équipe magazine, it has been awarded by the European Sports Media since the 1996–97 season. Lionel Messi has won the award a record six times, all while playing for Barcelona.","image":"Golden_Shoe%2C_Lionel_Messi_2012-2013.jpg.webp","url":"European_Golden_Shoe"}
