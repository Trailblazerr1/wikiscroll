{"title":"Umayyad Caliphate","summary":"The Umayyad Caliphate (661–750 CE; UK: /ʊˈmaɪjæd, uːˈ-/,[2] US: /uːˈmaɪ(j)əd, -aɪæd/;[3] Arabic: ٱلْخِلَافَة ٱلْأُمَوِيَّة‎, romanized: al-Khilāfah al-ʾUmawīyah)[4] was the second of the four major caliphates established after the death of Prophet Muhammad. The caliphate was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: ٱلْأُمَوِيُّون‎, al-ʾUmawīyūn, or بَنُو أُمَيَّة, Banū ʾUmayyah, \"Sons of Umayyah\"). The third caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, Uthman ibn Affan (r. 644–656), was also a member of the Umayyad clan. The family established dynastic, hereditary rule with Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan, long-time governor of al-Sham (Greater Syria), who became the sixth caliph after the end of the First Fitna in 661. After Mu'awiyah's death in 680, conflicts over the succession resulted in the Second Fitna,[5] and power eventually fell into the hands of Marwan I from another branch of the clan. The region of Syria remained the Umayyads' main power base thereafter, and Damascus was their capital.","image":"White_flag_3_to_2.svg.png.webp"}
