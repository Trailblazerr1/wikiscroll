{"title":"Solid-state physics","summary":"Solid-state physics is the study of rigid matter, or solids, through methods such as quantum mechanics, crystallography, electromagnetism, and metallurgy.  It is the largest branch of condensed matter physics. Solid-state physics studies how the large-scale properties of solid materials result from their atomic-scale properties.   Thus,  solid-state physics forms a theoretical basis of materials science.  It also has direct applications, for example in the technology of transistors and semiconductors.","image":"Fcc_lattice_4.jpg.webp","url":"Solid-state_physics"}
