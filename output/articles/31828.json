{"title":"New Lanark","summary":"New Lanark is a village on the River Clyde, approximately 1.4 miles (2.2 kilometres) from Lanark, in Lanarkshire, and some 25 miles (40Â km) southeast of Glasgow, Scotland.  It was founded in 1786 by David Dale, who built cotton mills and housing for the mill workers.  Dale built the mills there in a brief partnership with the English inventor and entrepreneur Richard Arkwright to take advantage of the water power provided by the only waterfalls on the River Clyde. Under the ownership of a partnership that included Dale's son-in-law, Robert Owen, a Welsh utopian socialist and philanthropist, New Lanark became a successful business and an early example of a planned settlement and so an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.[1]","image":"New_Lanark_buildings_2009.jpg.webp","url":"New_Lanark"}
