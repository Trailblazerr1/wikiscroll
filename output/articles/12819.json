{"title":"Dhoti","summary":"The dhoti, also known as Dhuti, mardani, chaadra, dhotar or panchey, is a type of sarong, tied in a manner that outwardly resembles \"loose trousers\".[1][2][3] It is a lower garment forming part of the national or ethnic costume for men in the Indian subcontinent.[4] The dhoti is fashioned out of a rectangular piece of unstitched cloth, usually around 4.5 metres (15Â ft) long, wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted either in the front or the back. Dhotis come in plain or solid colours, silk dhotis with embroidered borders are considered to be formal wear. The dhoti is touted as the male counterpart of the sari worn by females to religious and secular ceremonies (functions).[5]","image":"Shad_Suk_Mysiem.JPG.webp","url":"Dhoti"}
