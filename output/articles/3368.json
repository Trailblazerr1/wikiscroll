{"title":"Amniote","summary":"Amniotes are a clade of tetrapod vertebrates that comprise sauropsids (including reptiles and birds) and synapsids (including mammals). They are distinguished by a membrane (amnion) protecting the embryo and a lack of a larval stage.[5] Thanks to this, amniotes lay eggs on land or retain them within the mother, unlike anamniotes (fishes and amphibians), which typically lay eggs in water. Older sources, particularly before the 20th century, may refer to amniotes as \"higher vertebrates\" and anamniotes as \"lower vertebrates\", based on the antiquated idea of the evolutionary great chain of being. The term amniote comes from the Greek ἀμνίον amnion, \"membrane surrounding the fetus\", and earlier \"bowl in which the blood of sacrificed animals was caught\", from  ἀμνός amnos, \"lamb\".[6]","image":"Amniota.jpg.webp"}
