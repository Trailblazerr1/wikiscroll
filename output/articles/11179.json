{"title":"Coral bleaching","summary":"Coral bleaching is the process when corals become white due to various stressors, such as changes in temperature, light, or nutrients.[1][2] Bleaching occurs when coral polyps expel the algae (zooxanthellae) that live inside their tissue, causing the coral to turn white.[1] The zooxanthellae are photosynthetic, and as the water temperature rises, they begin to produce reactive oxygen species.[2] This is toxic to the coral, so the coral expels the zooxanthellae.[2] Since the zooxanthellae produce the majority of coral pigmentation,[2] the coral tissue becomes transparent, revealing the coral skeleton made of calcium carbonate.[2] Most bleached corals appear bright white, but some are pastel blue, yellow, or pink due to proteins in the coral.[2]","image":"Bleachedcoral.jpg.webp","url":"Coral_bleaching"}
