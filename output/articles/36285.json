{"title":"Prosthesis","summary":"In medicine, a prosthesis (plural: prostheses; from Ancient Greek prosthesis, \"addition, application, attachment\")[1] or prosthetic implant[2][3] is an artificial device that replaces a missing body part, which may be lost through trauma, disease, or a condition present at birth (congenital disorder). Prostheses are intended to restore the normal functions of the missing body part.[4] Amputee rehabilitation is primarily coordinated by a physiatrist as part of an inter-disciplinary team consisting of physiatrists, prosthetists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists.[5] Prostheses can be created by hand or with computer-aided design (CAD), a software interface that helps creators design and analyze the creation with computer-generated 2-D and 3-D graphics as well as analysis and optimization tools.[6]","image":"86_ACPS_Atlanta_1996_Swimming_General_Views.jpg.webp"}
