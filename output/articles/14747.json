{"title":"Empire","summary":"An empire is a \"political unit\" made up of several territories and peoples, \"usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries\".[1] Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state called an empire and whose head of state is an  emperor, (an example being the Roman Empire); but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities  are called empires or ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples).","image":"Roman_Empire_Trajan_117AD.png.webp","url":"Empire"}
