{"title":"Lake Eyre","summary":"Lake Eyre (/ɛər/ AIR), officially known as Kati Thanda–Lake Eyre,[1] is an endorheic lake in east-central Far North South Australia, some 700 km (435 mi) north of Adelaide.  The shallow lake is the depocentre of the vast endorheic Lake Eyre basin, and contains the lowest natural point in Australia at approximately 15 m (49 ft) below sea level (AHD), and on the rare occasions that it fills completely, is the largest lake in Australia covering an area up to 9,500 km2 (3,668 sq mi).  When the lake is full, it has the same salinity level as seawater, but becomes hypersaline as the lake dries up and the water evaporates.","image":"NEO_lake_eyre_big.jpg.webp","url":"Lake_Eyre"}
