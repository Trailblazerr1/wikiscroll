{"title":"Linear particle accelerator","summary":"A linear particle accelerator (often shortened to linac) is a type of particle accelerator that accelerates charged subatomic particles or ions to a high speed by subjecting them to a series of oscillating electric potentials along a linear beamline. The principles for such machines were proposed by Gustav Ising in 1924,[1] while the first machine that worked was constructed by Rolf Wider√∏e in 1928[2] at the RWTH Aachen University.[3][4]\nLinacs have many applications: they generate X-rays and high energy electrons for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy, serve as particle injectors for higher-energy accelerators, and are used directly to achieve the highest kinetic energy for light particles (electrons and positrons) for particle physics.","image":"Aust.-Synchrotron%2C-Linac%2C-14.06.2007.jpg.webp"}
