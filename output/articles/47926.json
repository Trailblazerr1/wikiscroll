{"title":"War of the Bavarian Succession","summary":"The War of the Bavarian Succession (German: Bayerischer Erbfolgekrieg; 3 July 1778 â€“ 13 May 1779) was a dispute between the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy and an alliance of Saxony and Prussia over succession to the Electorate of Bavaria after the extinction of the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach. The Habsburgs sought to acquire Bavaria, and the alliance opposed them, favoring another branch of the Wittelsbachs. Both sides mobilized large armies, but the only fighting in the war was a few minor skirmishes. However, thousands of soldiers died from disease and starvation, earning the conflict the name Kartoffelkrieg (Potato War) in Prussia and Saxony; in Habsburg Austria, it was sometimes called the Zwetschgenrummel (Plum Fuss).","image":"Friedrich_der_Grosse_und_der_Feldscher.jpg.webp"}
