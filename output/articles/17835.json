{"title":"George S. Patton slapping incidents","summary":"In early August 1943, Lieutenant General George S. Patton slapped two United States Army soldiers under his command during the Sicily Campaign of World War II. Patton's hard-driving personality and lack of belief in the medical condition of combat stress reaction, then known as \"battle fatigue\" or \"shell shock\", led to the soldiers' becoming the subject of his ire in incidents on 3 and 10 August, when Patton struck and berated them after discovering they were patients at evacuation hospitals away from the front lines without apparent physical injuries.","image":"GeorgeSPatton.jpg.webp","url":"George_S._Patton_slapping_incidents"}
