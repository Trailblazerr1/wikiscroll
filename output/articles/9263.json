{"title":"Character (arts)","summary":"In fiction, a character (sometimes known as a fictional character) is a person or other being in a narrative (such as a novel, play, television series, film, or video game).[1][2][3] The character may be entirely fictional or based on a real-life person, in which case the distinction of a \"fictional\" versus \"real\" character may be made.[2] Derived from the ancient Greek word χαρακτήρ, the English word dates from the Restoration,[4] although it became widely used after its appearance in Tom Jones in 1749.[5][6] From this, the sense of \"a part played by an actor\" developed.[6] (Before this development, the term dramatis personae, naturalized in English from Latin and meaning \"masks of the drama,\" encapsulated the notion of characters from the literal aspect of masks.) Character, particularly when enacted by an actor in the theatre or cinema, involves \"the illusion of being a human person\".[7] In literature, characters guide readers through their stories, helping them to understand plots and ponder themes.[8] Since the end of the 18th century, the phrase \"in character\" has been used to describe an effective impersonation by an actor.[6] Since the 19th century, the art of creating characters, as practiced by actors or writers, has been called characterisation.[6]","image":"Four_Commedia_dell’Arte_Figures_claude-gillot.jpg.webp"}
