{"title":"Desktop publishing","summary":"Desktop publishing (DTP) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal (\"desktop\") computer. It was first used almost exclusively for print publications, but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content.[1] Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content, from menus to magazines to books, without the expense of commercial printing.[2]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
