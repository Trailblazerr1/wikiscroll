{"title":"Prajnaparamita","summary":"Prajñāpāramitā means \"the Perfection of (Transcendent) Wisdom\" in Mahāyāna Buddhism. Prajñāpāramitā refers to this perfected way of seeing the nature of reality, as well as to a particular body of sūtras and to the personification of the concept in the Bodhisattva known as the \"Great Mother\" (Tibetan: Yum Chenmo). The word Prajñāpāramitā combines the Sanskrit words prajñā \"wisdom\" with pāramitā \"perfection\". Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in Mahāyāna Buddhism and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness (Śūnyatā) or 'lack of Svabhāva' (essence) and the works of Nāgārjuna. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the Bodhisattva path.","image":"Astasahasrika_Prajnaparamita_Image_of_Prajnaparamita.jpeg.webp","url":"Prajnaparamita"}
