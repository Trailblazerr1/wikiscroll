{"title":"Apoptosis","summary":"Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις, apóptōsis, 'falling off') is a form of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms.[1] Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and mRNA decay. The average adult human loses between 50 and 70 billion cells each day due to apoptosis.[lower-alpha 1] For an average human child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20–30 billion cells die per day.[3]","image":"Apoptosis_DU145_cells_mosaic.jpg.webp","url":"Apoptosis"}
