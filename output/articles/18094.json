{"title":"Gill","summary":"A gill (/ɡɪl/ (listen)) is a respiratory organ that many aquatic organisms use to extract dissolved oxygen from water and to excrete carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. Branchia (pl. branchiae) is the zoologists' name for gills (from Ancient Greek βράγχια).","image":"Carp_gill_defect.jpg.webp","url":"Gill"}
