{"title":"Protests against SOPA and PIPA","summary":"On January 18, 2012, a series of coordinated protests occurred against two proposed laws in the United States Congressâ€”the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). These followed smaller protests in late 2011. Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to copyright infringement (also known as piracy) arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. Protesters also argued that there were insufficient safeguards in place to protect sites based upon user-generated content.","image":"Google_Doodle_Censored_2.png.webp","url":"Protests_against_SOPA_and_PIPA"}
