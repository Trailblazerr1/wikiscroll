{"title":"Ising model","summary":"The Ising model (/ˈaɪsɪŋ/; German: [ˈiːzɪŋ]),  (or Lenz-Ising model or Ising-Lenz model),  named after the physicists Ernst Ising and Wilhelm Lenz (who developed it during their time at Hamburg University), is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic dipole moments of atomic \"spins\" that can be in one of two states (+1 or −1). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a lattice (where the local structure repeats periodically in all directions), allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. Neighboring spins that agree have a lower energy than those that disagree; the system tends to the lowest energy but heat disturbs this tendency, thus creating the possibility of different structural phases. The model allows the identification of phase transitions as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest statistical models to show a phase transition.[1]","image":"Increasing_disorder.svg.png.webp","url":"Ising_model"}
