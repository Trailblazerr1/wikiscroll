{"title":"Dynamical system","summary":"In mathematics, a dynamical system is a system in which a function describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space.  Examples include the mathematical models that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each springtime in a lake.","image":"Lorenz_attractor_yb.svg.png.webp"}
