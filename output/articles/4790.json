{"title":"Atherosclerosis","summary":"Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis[7] in which the wall of the artery develops abnormalities, called lesions. These lesions may lead to narrowing due to the buildup of atheromatous plaque.[8] At onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age.[1] When severe, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney problems, depending on which arteries are affected.[1]","image":"Endo_dysfunction_Athero.PNG.webp"}
