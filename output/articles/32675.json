{"title":"Occitan language","summary":"Occitan (English:  /ˈɒksɪtən, -tæn, -tɑːn/;[9][10] Occitan: occitan [utsiˈta],[lower-alpha 1]), also known as lenga d'òc (Occitan: [ˈleŋɡɔ ˈðɔ(k)] (listen); French: langue d'oc) by its native speakers, is a Romance language (or branch of numerous of these) spoken in Southern France, Monaco, Italy's Occitan Valleys, and Catalonia's Val d'Aran; collectively, these regions are sometimes referred to as Occitania. It is also spoken in South Italy (Calabria) in a linguistic enclave of Cosenza area (mostly Guardia Piemontese). Some include Catalan in Occitan, as the distance between this language and some Occitan dialects (such as the Gascon language) is similar to the distance among different Occitan dialects. Catalan was considered a dialect of Occitan until the end of the 19th century[11] and still today remains its closest relative.[12]","image":"Flag_of_Catalonia.svg.png.webp","url":"Occitan_language"}
