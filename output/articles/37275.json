{"title":"Real-time tactics","summary":"Real-time tactics (RTT)[1] is a subgenre of tactical wargames played in real-time simulating the considerations and circumstances of operational warfare and military tactics.  It is differentiated from real-time strategy gameplay by the lack of classic resource micromanagement and base or unit building, as well as the greater importance of individual units[1][2] and a focus on complex battlefield tactics.","image":"Video-Game-Controller-Icon-IDV-green-strategy.svg.png.webp"}
