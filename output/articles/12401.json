{"title":"Deciduous teeth","summary":"Deciduous teeth or primary teeth, also informally known as baby teeth, milk teeth, or temporary teeth,[1] are the first set of teeth in the growth and development of humans and other diphyodonts, which include most mammals but not elephants, kangaroos, or manatees which are polyphyodonts. Deciduous teeth develop during the embryonic stage of development and erupt (break through the gums and become visible in the mouth) during infancy. They are usually lost and replaced by permanent teeth, but in the absence of their permanent replacements, they can remain functional for many years into adulthood.","image":"Gray1001.png.webp","url":"Deciduous_teeth"}
