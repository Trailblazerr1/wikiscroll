{"title":"Solow–Swan model","summary":"The Solow–Swan model is an economic model of long-run economic growth. It attempts to explain long-run economic growth by looking at capital accumulation, labor or population growth, and increases in productivity, commonly referred to as technological progress. At its core, it is an aggregate production function, often specified to be of Cobb–Douglas type, which enables the model \"to make contact with microeconomics\".[1]: 26  The model was developed independently by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan in 1956,[2][3][note 1] and superseded the Keynesian Harrod–Domar model.","image":"Bank_of_England_Facade.jpg.webp"}
