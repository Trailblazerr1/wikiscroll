{"title":"Epitaph","summary":"An epitaph (from Ancient Greek  ἐπιτάφιος (epitáphios) 'a funeral oration'; from  ἐπι- (epi-) 'at, over', and  τάφος (táphos) 'tomb')[1][2] is a short text honoring a deceased person. Strictly speaking, it refers to text that is inscribed on a tombstone or plaque, but it may also be used in a figurative sense. Some epitaphs are specified by the person themselves before their death, while others are chosen by those responsible for the burial. An epitaph may be written in prose or in poem verse; poets have been known to compose their own epitaphs prior to their death.","image":"The_day_will_come.jpg.webp","url":"Epitaph"}
