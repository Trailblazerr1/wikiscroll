{"title":"Portuguese people","summary":"The Portuguese people are a Romance nation and ethnic group indigenous to Portugal who share a common Portuguese culture, ancestry and language.[49][50][51] The Portuguese people's heritage largely derives from the pre-Celts (Lusitanians, Conii)[52][53] and Celts (Gallaecians, Turduli and Celtici),[54][55][56] who were Romanized after the conquest of the region by the ancient Romans.[57][58] A small number of male lineages descend from Germanic tribes who arrived after the Roman period as ruling elites, including the Suebi, Buri, Vandals, Visigoths with the highest incidence occurring in northern and central Portugal.[59][60][61] The pastoral Caucasusâ€™ Alans left small traces in a few central-southern areas.[62][63][64] Finally, the Umayyad occupation of Iberia also left small Jewish, Moorish and Saqaliba genetic contributions, particularly in the south of the country.[65][66][57][58]","image":"Flag_of_Portugal.svg.png.webp","url":"Portuguese_people"}
