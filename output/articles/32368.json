{"title":"North Circular Road","summary":"The North Circular Road (officially the A406 and sometimes known as simply the North Circular) is a 25.7-mile-long (41.4Â km) ring road around Central London in England. It runs from Chiswick in the west to Woolwich in the east via suburban North London, connecting various suburbs and other trunk roads in the region. Together with its counterpart, the South Circular Road, it forms a ring road around central London. This ring road does not make a complete circuit of the city, being C-shaped rather than a complete loop as the crossing of the River Thames in the east is made on the Woolwich Ferry.","image":"UK_road_A406.svg.png.webp","url":"North_Circular_Road"}
