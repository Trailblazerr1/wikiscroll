{"title":"Hare","summary":"Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus. Hares are classified in the same family as rabbits. They have similar herbivorous diets, but are generally larger in size than rabbits, have proportionately longer ears and live solitarily or in pairs. They do not dig burrows, but nest in slight depressions called forms, often in long grass. Also unlike rabbits, their young are able to fend for themselves shortly after birth rather than emerging blind and helpless. Having long, powerful hind legs, most are fast runners. Hare species are native to Africa, Eurasia, and  North America.","image":"Scrub_Hare_(Lepus_saxatilis)_close-up_(30544290256)_(2).jpg.webp"}
