{"title":"Delilah","summary":"Delilah (/dɪˈlaɪlə/ dil-EYE-lə; Hebrew: דְּלִילָה‎, romanized: Dəlīlā, meaning \"delicate\";[1] Arabic: دليلة‎, romanized: Dalīlah; Greek: Δαλιδά, romanized: Dalidá) is a woman mentioned in the sixteenth chapter of the Book of Judges in the Hebrew Bible.[2]  She is loved by Samson,[2] a Nazirite who possesses great strength[3] and serves as the final Judge of Israel.[4] Delilah is bribed by the lords of the Philistines to discover the source of his strength. After three failed attempts at doing so, she finally goads Samson into telling her that his vigor is derived from his hair. As he sleeps, Delilah orders a servant to cut Samson's hair, thereby enabling her to turn him over to the Philistines.","image":"Gustave_Moreau_-_Dalila.jpg.webp"}
