{"title":"USS Massachusetts (BB-59)","summary":"USS Massachusetts (BB-59) is the third of four  South Dakota-class fast battleships built for the United States Navy in the late 1930s.  The first American battleships designed after the Washington treaty system began to break down in the mid-1930s, they took advantage of an escalator clause that allowed increasing the main battery to 16-inch (406 mm) guns, but refusal to authorize larger battleships kept their displacement close to the Washington limit of 35,000 long tons (36,000 t). A requirement to be armored against the same caliber of guns as they carried, combined with the displacement restriction, resulted in cramped ships, a problem that was exacerbated by wartime modifications that considerably strengthened their anti-aircraft batteries and significantly increased their crews.","image":"USS_Massachusetts_(BB-59)_underway_c1944.jpg.webp"}
