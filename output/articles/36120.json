{"title":"Prism (Katy Perry album)","summary":"Prism is the fourth studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It was released by Capitol Records on October 18, 2013. While the album was initially planned to be \"darker\" than her previous material, Prism ultimately became a prominently dance-inspired record. The singer worked with several past collaborators, while enlisting new producers and guest vocals. Much of Prism revolves around the themes of living in the present, relationships, and self-empowerment. The album garnered generally positive reviews with critics praising its lyrical content for being more \"mature\" and personal, while others considered Prism to be more formulaic than her previous material.","image":"Katy_Perry_-_Prism_cover.png.webp"}
