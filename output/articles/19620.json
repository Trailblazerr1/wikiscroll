{"title":"Hardcourt","summary":"A hardcourt (or hard court) is a surface or floor on which a sport is played, most usually in reference to tennis courts. It is typically made of rigid materials such as asphalt or concrete, and covered with acrylic resins to seal the surface and mark the playing lines, while providing some cushioning.[1][2] Historically, hardwood surfaces were also in use in indoor settings, similar to an indoor basketball court, but these surfaces are rare now.[3]","image":"Hardcourt_tennis_court_curtiss_park_saline_michigan.JPG.webp","url":"Hardcourt"}
