{"title":"Catchphrase","summary":"A catchphrase (alternatively spelled catch phrase) is a phrase or expression recognized by its repeated utterance. Such phrases often originate in popular culture and in the arts, and typically spread through word of mouth and a variety of mass media (such as films, internet, literature and publishing, television such as cartoons and radio). Some become the de facto or literal \"trademark\" or \"signature\" of the person or character with whom they originated, and can be instrumental in the typecasting of a particular actor.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
