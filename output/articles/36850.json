{"title":"RISC-V","summary":"RISC-V (pronounced \"risk-five\"[1]: 1 ) is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, the RISC-V ISA is provided under open source licenses that do not require fees to use. A number of companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware, open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains.","image":"RISC-V-logo.svg.png.webp"}
