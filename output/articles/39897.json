{"title":"Section 377","summary":"Section 377 of the British colonial penal code criminalized all sexual acts \"against the order of nature\". The law was used to prosecute people engaging in oral and anal sex along with homosexual activity. The penal code remains in many former colonies and has been used to criminalize third gender people, such as the apwint in Myanmar.[1][2] In many former colonies it has been repealed or is no longer enforceable.","image":"Bhubaneswar_Pride_Parade_2018_02.jpg.webp"}
