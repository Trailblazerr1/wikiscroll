{"title":"Squab","summary":"In culinary terminology, squab is a baby domestic pigeon, typically under four weeks old,[1] or its meat. The meat is widely described as tasting like dark chicken. The term is probably of Scandinavian origin; the Swedish word skvabb means \"loose, fat flesh\".[2] It formerly applied to all dove and pigeon species, such as the wood pigeon, the mourning dove, the extinct-in-the-wild socorro dove, and the now extinct passenger pigeon,[3][4] and their meat. More recently, squab meat comes almost entirely from domesticated pigeons. The meat of dove and pigeon gamebirds hunted primarily for sport is rarely called squab.[3]","image":"Pigeon_Chicks2_2am.jpg.webp"}
