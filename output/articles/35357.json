{"title":"Polaron","summary":"A polaron is a quasiparticle used in condensed matter physics to understand the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The polaron concept was proposed by Lev Landau in 1933[1] and Solomon Pekar in 1946[2] to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms displace from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. For comparison of the models proposed in these papers see M. I. Dykman and E. I. Rashba, The roots of polaron theory, Physics Today 68, 10 (2015). This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron's effective mass.","image":"QuantumPhaseTransition.svg.png.webp","url":"Polaron"}
