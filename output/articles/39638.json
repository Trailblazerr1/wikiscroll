{"title":"Science-Fiction Plus","summary":"Science-Fiction Plus was an American science fiction magazine published by Hugo Gernsback for seven issues in 1953.  In 1926, Gernsback had launched Amazing Stories,  the first science fiction magazine, but he had not been involved in the genre since 1936, when he sold Wonder Stories.  Science-Fiction Plus was initially in slick format, meaning that it was large-size and printed on glossy paper.  Gernsback had always believed in the educational power of science fiction, and he continued to advocate his views in the new magazine's editorials.  The managing editor, Sam Moskowitz, had been a reader of the early pulp magazines, and published many writers who had been popular before World War II, such as Raymond Z. Gallun, Eando Binder, and Harry Bates.  Combined with Gernsback's earnest editorials, the use of these early writers gave the magazine an anachronistic feel.","image":"Science_fiction_plus_195303_v1_n1.jpg.webp"}
