{"title":"Hyperhidrosis","summary":"Hyperhidrosis is a condition characterized by abnormally increased sweating,[1] in excess of that required for regulation of body temperature.[2] Although primarily a benign physical burden, hyperhidrosis can deteriorate quality of life from a psychological, emotional, and social perspective.[3] This excess of sweat happens even if the person is not engaging in tasks that require muscular effort, and it does not depend on the exposure to heat.[4] Common places to sweat can include underarms, face, neck, back, groin, feet, and hands. It has been called by some researchers 'the silent handicap'.[5]","image":"Hyperhidrosis_Treatment.jpg.webp","url":"Hyperhidrosis"}
