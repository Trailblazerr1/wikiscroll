{"title":"Environmental migrant","summary":"Environmental migrantsâ€¯[lower-alpha 1] are people who are forced to leave their home region due to sudden or long-term changes to their local or regional environment. These changes compromise their well-being or livelihood, and include increased drought, desertification, sea level rise, and disruption of seasonal weather patterns (such as monsoons[1]). The degree to which some of these changes occur can be reduced by means of climate adaptation projects. Climate refugees may flee or migrate to another country, or they may migrate internally within their own country.[2] Though there is no uniform, clear-cut definition of environmental migration, the idea is gaining attention as policy-makers and environmental and social scientists attempt to conceptualize the potential social effects of climate change and environmental degradation.","image":"Dorothea_Lange%2C_Drought_refugees_from_Oklahoma_camping_by_the_roadside%2C_Blythe%2C_California%2C_1936.jpg.webp","url":"Environmental_migrant"}
