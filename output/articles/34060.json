{"title":"Passport","summary":"A passport is an official travel document issued by a government that contains a given person's identity. It enables its holder travel to and from foreign countries and to access consular assistance while overseas. The document certifies the personal identity and nationality of its holder.[1] Standard passports contain the full name, photograph, place and date of birth, signature, and the expiration date of the passport. While passports are typically issued by national governments, certain subnational governments[lower-alpha 1] are authorised to issue passports to citizens residing within their borders.","image":"Passports-assorted.jpg.webp"}
