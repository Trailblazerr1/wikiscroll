{"title":"FCC fairness doctrine","summary":"The fairness doctrine of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), introduced in 1949, was a policy that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that fairly reflected differing viewpoints.[1] In 1987, the FCC abolished the fairness doctrine,[2] prompting some to urge its reintroduction through either Commission policy or congressional legislation.[3] However later the FCC removed the rule that implemented the policy from the Federal Register in August 2011.[4]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"FCC_fairness_doctrine"}
