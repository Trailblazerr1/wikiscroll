{"title":"Time dilation","summary":"In physics and relativity, time dilation is the difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks. It is either due to a relative velocity between them (special relativistic \"kinetic\" time dilation) or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (general relativistic gravitational time dilation). When unspecified, \"time dilation\" usually refers to the effect due to velocity.","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp"}
