{"title":"Village (United States)","summary":"In the United States, the meaning of \"village\" varies by geographic area and legal jurisdiction. In many areas, \"village\" is a term, sometimes informal, for a type of administrative division at the local government level. Since the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government from legislating on local government, the states are free to have political subdivisions called \"villages\" or not to and to define the word in many ways. Typically, a village is a type of municipality, although it can also be a special district or an unincorporated area.  It may or may not be recognized for governmental purposes.","image":"lossy-page1-230px-Shaker_Village%2C_Main_Street%2C_Pittsfield%2C_Mass_(NYPL_b12647398-68623).tiff.jpg.webp","url":"Village_(United_States)"}
