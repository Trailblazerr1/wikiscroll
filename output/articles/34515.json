{"title":"Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses in Nazi Germany","summary":"Jehovah's Witnesses suffered religious persecution in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1945 after refusing to perform military service, join Nazi organizations, or give allegiance to the Hitler regime. An estimated 10,000 Witnesses—half of the number of members in Germany during that period—were imprisoned, including 2000 who were sent to Nazi concentration camps. An estimated 1200 died in custody, including 250 who were executed. They were the first Christian denomination banned by the Nazi government and the most extensively and intensively persecuted.[1]","image":"JW_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Persecution_of_Jehovah's_Witnesses_in_Nazi_Germany"}
