{"title":"Holland","summary":"Holland is a geographical region[2] and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands.[2] The name Holland is also frequently used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands.[2] This usage is commonly accepted in other countries and is also commonly employed by the Dutch themselves.[3] However, some in the Netherlands, particularly those from regions outside Holland, find it undesirable or misrepresentative to use the term for the whole country.[4]","image":"Holland_position.svg.png.webp"}
