{"title":"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket","summary":"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is the fourth studio album by American rock band Blink-182, released on June 12, 2001, by MCA Records. The band had spent much of the previous year traveling and supporting their previous album Enema of the State (1999), which launched their mainstream career. The album's title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation (\"take off your pants and jack it\"), and its cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane (\"take off\"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. It is the band's final release through MCA.","image":"Blink-182_-_Take_Off_Your_Pants_and_Jacket_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Take_Off_Your_Pants_and_Jacket"}
