{"title":"Uncle Sam","summary":"Uncle Sam (which has the same initials as United States) is a common national personification of the federal government of the United States or the country in general that, according to legend, came into use during the War of 1812 and was supposedly named for Samuel Wilson. The actual origin is obscure.[3] Since the early 19th century, Uncle Sam has been a popular symbol of the US government in American culture and a manifestation of patriotic emotion.[4] While the figure of Uncle Sam represents specifically the government, Columbia represents the United States as a nation. The image has also developed notoriety for its use in military propaganda.[5]","image":"J._M._Flagg%2C_I_Want_You_for_U.S._Army_poster_(1917).jpg.webp"}
