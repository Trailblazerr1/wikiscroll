{"title":"Sukhumi","summary":"Sukhumi (Russian: Суху́м(и), Sukhum(i) [sʊˈxum(ʲɪ)]) or Sokhumi (Georgian: სოხუმი, [sɔxumi] (listen)), also known by its Abkhaz name Aqwa (Abkhazian: Аҟәа, Aqwa), is a city in a wide bay on the Black Sea's eastern coast. It is both the capital and largest city of the Republic of Abkhazia, which has controlled it since the Abkhazia war in 1992-93 (although internationally it is still considered part of Georgia). The city, which has an airport, is a port, major rail junction and a holiday resort because of its beaches, sanatoriums, mineral-water spas and semitropical climate. It is also a member of the International Black Sea Club.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
