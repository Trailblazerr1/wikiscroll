{"title":"California grizzly bear","summary":"The California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus) is an extinct population or subspecies of the brown bear, generally known (together with other North American brown bear populations) as the grizzly bear. \"Grizzly\" could have meant \"grizzled\" –  that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair –  or \"fear-inspiring\" (as a phonetic spelling of \"grisly\").[2] Nonetheless, after careful study, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 – not for its hair, but for its character – as Ursus horribilis (\"terrifying bear\").[3] Genetically, North American brown bears are closely related;[4] in size and coloring, the California grizzly bear was much like the Kodiak bear of the southern coast of Alaska. In California, it was particularly admired for its beauty, size, and strength. The grizzly became a symbol of the Bear Flag Republic, a moniker that was attached to the short-lived attempt by a group of U.S. settlers to break away from Mexico in 1846. Later, this rebel flag became the basis for the state flag of California, and then California was known as the \"Bear State.\"[5]","image":"Ursus_arctos_californicus%2C_Santa_Barbara%2C_Natural_History_Museum.jpg.webp"}
