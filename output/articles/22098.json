{"title":"Intel Core (microarchitecture)","summary":"The Intel Core microarchitecture (formerly named Next-Generation Micro-Architecture) is a multi-core processor microarchitecture unveiled by Intel in Q1 2006. It is based on the Yonah processor design and can be considered an iteration of the P6 microarchitecture introduced in 1995 with Pentium Pro. High power consumption and heat intensity, the resulting inability to effectively increase clock rate, and other shortcomings such as an inefficient pipeline were the primary reasons why Intel abandoned the NetBurst microarchitecture and switched to a different architectural design, delivering high efficiency through a small pipeline rather than high clock rates. The Core microarchitecture initially did not reach the clock rates of the NetBurst microarchitecture, even after moving to 45 nm lithography.  However after many generations of successor microarchitectures which used Core as their basis (such as Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and more), Intel managed to eventually surpass the clock rates of Netburst with the Devil's Canyon (Improved version of Haswell) microarchitecture reaching a base frequency of 4 GHz and a maximum tested frequency of 4.4 GHz using 22 nm lithography.","image":"Intel_Core2_arch.svg.png.webp","url":"Intel_Core_(microarchitecture)"}
