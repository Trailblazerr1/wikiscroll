{"title":"Cogito, ergo sum","summary":"The Latin cogito, ergo sum,[lower-alpha 1] usually translated into English as \"I think, therefore I am\",[lower-alpha 2] is a philosophical statement that was made by René Descartes. The phrase originally appeared in French as je pense, donc je suis in his 1637 Discourse on the Method, so as to reach a wider audience than Latin would have allowed.[1] It appeared in Latin in his later Principles of Philosophy, and a similar phrase also featured prominently in his Meditations on First Philosophy.  The dictum is also sometimes referred to as the cogito.[2]  As Descartes explained it, \"we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt.\" A fuller version, articulated by Antoine Léonard Thomas, aptly captures Descartes' intent: dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum (\"I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am\").[lower-alpha 3][lower-alpha 4]","image":"Portrait_of_René_Descartes%2C_bust%2C_three-quarter_facing_left_in_an_oval_border%2C_(white_background_removed).png.webp","url":"Cogito,_ergo_sum"}
