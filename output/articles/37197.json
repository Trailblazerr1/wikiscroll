{"title":"Rational expectations","summary":"In economics, \"rational expectations\" are model-consistent expectations, in that agents inside the model are assumed to \"know the model\" and on average take the model's predictions as valid.[1] Rational expectations ensure internal consistency in models involving uncertainty. To obtain consistency within a model, the predictions of future values of economically relevant variables from the model are assumed to be the same as that of the decision-makers in the model, given their information set, the nature of the random processes involved, and model structure. The rational expectations assumption is used especially in many contemporary macroeconomic models.","image":"Bank_of_England_Facade.jpg.webp"}
