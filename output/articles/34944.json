{"title":"Pidyon haben","summary":"The pidyon haben (Hebrew: פדיון הבן‎) or redemption of the first-born (if male and not by caesarean)[1] is a mitzvah in Judaism whereby a Jewish firstborn son is \"redeemed\" by use of silver coins. Interpretations differ in what the firstborn son is to be redeemed from, ranging from being redeemed from their firstborn status, which garnered negative connotations after the Ten Plagues, or their obligation to serve as a priest.","image":"Pidyon_HaBen_P6020102.JPG.webp","url":"Pidyon_haben"}
