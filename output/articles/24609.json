{"title":"Kentrosaurus","summary":"Kentrosaurus (/ˌkɛntroʊˈsɔːrəs/ KEN-tro-SAWR-əs) is a genus of stegosaurid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Tanzania. The type species is K. aethiopicus, named and described by German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig in 1915. Often thought to be a \"primitive\" member of the Stegosauria, several recent cladistic analyses find it as more derived than many other stegosaurs, and a close relative of Stegosaurus from the North American Morrison Formation within the Stegosauridae.","image":"Berlin_Naturkundemuseum_Dino_Eingangshalle.jpg.webp","url":"Kentrosaurus"}
