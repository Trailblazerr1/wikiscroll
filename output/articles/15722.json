{"title":"Falles","summary":"The Falles (Valencian: Falles; Spanish: Fallas) is a traditional celebration held annually in commemoration of Saint Joseph in the city of Valencia, Spain. The five main days celebrated are from 15 to 19 March,[1] while the Mascletà, a pyrotechnic spectacle of firecracker detonation and fireworks display, takes place every day from 1 to 19 March.[2] The term Falles refers to both the celebration and the monuments (Falla, singular; Falles, plural) burnt during the celebration.[3] A number of towns in the Valencian Community have similar celebrations inspired by the original Falles de València celebration. The Falles festival was added to UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage of humanity list on 30 November 2016.[4]","image":"Natura_Mare_(2).jpg.webp","url":"Falles"}
