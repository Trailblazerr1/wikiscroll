{"title":"Burghley House","summary":"Burghley House (/ˈbɜːrli/[1]) is a grand sixteenth-century English country house near Stamford, Lincolnshire. It is a leading example of the Elizabethan prodigy house, built and still lived in by the Cecil family. The exterior largely retains its Elizabethan appearance, but most of the interiors date from remodellings before 1800. The house is open to the public on a seasonal basis[2] and displays a circuit of grand and richly furnished state apartments. Its park was laid out by Capability Brown.[3]","image":"Front_of_Burghley_House_2009.jpg.webp"}
