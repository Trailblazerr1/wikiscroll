{"title":"Amami rabbit","summary":"The Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi; Amami: [ʔosaɡi]), or Amami no-kuro-usagi (アマミノクロウサギ 奄美野黒兔, lit. \"Amami wild black rabbit\"), also known as the Ryukyu rabbit is a dark-furred rabbit which is only found in Amami Ōshima and Toku-no-Shima, two small islands between southern Kyūshū and Okinawa in Kagoshima Prefecture (but actually closer to Okinawa) in Japan. Often called a living fossil, the Amami rabbit is a living remnant of ancient rabbits that once lived on the Asian mainland, where they died out, remaining only on the two small Japanese islands where they live today.[3]","image":"Amami_rabbit_Stuffed_specimen.jpg.webp","url":"Amami_rabbit"}
