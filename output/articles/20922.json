{"title":"Hoxne Hoard","summary":"The Hoxne Hoard (/ˈhɒksən/ HOK-sən)[2] is the largest hoard of late Roman silver and gold discovered in Britain,[3] and the largest collection of gold and silver coins of the fourth and fifth centuries found anywhere within the Roman Empire. It was found by Eric Lawes, a metal detectorist in the village of Hoxne in Suffolk, England in 1992. The hoard consists of 14,865 Roman gold, silver, and bronze coins and approximately 200 items of silver tableware and gold jewellery.[4] The objects are now in the British Museum in London, where the most important pieces and a selection of the rest are on permanent display. In 1993, the Treasure Valuation Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (about £3.64 million in 2020).[5]","image":"Hoxne_Hoard_1.jpg.webp"}
