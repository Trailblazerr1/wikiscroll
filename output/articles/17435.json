{"title":"Gardasil","summary":"Gardasil, technically known as recombinant human papillomavirus vaccine [types 6, 11, 16, 18],[3][4][5][6][7] is a vaccine for use in the prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), developed by Merck & Co.[8] High-risk human papilloma virus (hr-HPV) genital infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection among women.[9] The HPV strains that Gardasil protects against are sexually transmitted,[10] specifically HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18.[11][12] HPV types 16 and 18 cause an estimated 70% of cervical cancers,[13][14] and are responsible for most HPV-induced anal,[15] vulvar, vaginal,[16] and penile cancer cases.[15] HPV types 6 and 11 cause an estimated 90% of genital warts cases.[17] HPV type 16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers,[18] and the prevalence is higher in males than females.[18] Though Gardasil does not treat existing infection, vaccination is still recommended for HPV-positive individuals, as it may protect against one or more different strains of the disease.[19]","image":"Gardasil_vaccine_and_box_new.jpg.webp"}
