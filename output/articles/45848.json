{"title":"Treaty of Gulistan","summary":"The Treaty of Gulistan (Russian: Гюлистанский договор; Persian: عهدنامه گلستان‎) was a peace treaty concluded between the Russian Empire and Iran on 24 October 1813 in the village of Gulistan (now in the Goranboy District of Azerbaijan) as a result of the first full-scale Russo-Persian War, (1804 to 1813). The peace negotiations were precipitated by the successful storming of Lankaran by General Pyotr Kotlyarevsky on 1 January 1813. It was the first of the series of treaties (the last being the Akhal Treaty) signed between Qajar Iran and Imperial Russia that forced Persia to cede or recognize Russian influence over the territories that formerly were part of Iran.[1][2]","image":"Gulistan-Treaty.jpg.webp","url":"Treaty_of_Gulistan"}
