{"title":"Gorham's Cave","summary":"Gorham's Cave (Spanish: Cueva de Gorham, pronounced [ɡoɾˈãm]) is a sea-level cave in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Though not a sea cave, it is often mistaken for one. Considered to be one of the last known habitations of the Neanderthals in Europe, the cave gives its name to the Gorham's Cave complex, which is a combination of four distinct caves of such importance that they are combined into a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the only one in Gibraltar. The three other caves are Vanguard Cave, Hyaena Cave, and Bennett's Cave.[1]","image":"View_from_Gorham's_Cave%2C_Gibraltar.JPG.webp","url":"Gorham's_Cave"}
