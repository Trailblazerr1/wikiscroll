{"title":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome","summary":"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome—often abbreviated to benzo withdrawal or BZD withdrawal —is the cluster of signs and symptoms that emerge when a person who has been taking benzodiazepines, either medically or recreationally, and has developed a physical dependence, undergoes dosage reduction or discontinuation. Development of physical dependence and the resulting withdrawal symptoms, some of which may last for years, may result from taking the medication as prescribed. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, shaking, sweating, difficulty with concentration, confusion and cognitive difficulty, memory problems, dry retching and nausea, weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness, a host of perceptual changes, hallucinations, seizures, psychosis,[2] and increased risk of suicide[3][4] (see \"signs and symptoms\" section below for full list).  Further, these symptoms are notable for the manner in which they wax and wane and vary in severity from day to day or week by week instead of steadily decreasing in a straightforward monotonic manner.[5] This phenomenon is often referred to as \"waves\" and \"windows\".","image":"Diazepam2mgand5mgtablets.JPG.webp"}
