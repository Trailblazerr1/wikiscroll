{"title":"Woody Allen","summary":"Woody Allen (born Allan Stewart Konigsberg; November 30, 1935)[lower-alpha 1] is an American film director, writer, actor, and comedian whose career spans more than six decades and multiple Academy Award-winning films. He began his career writing material for television in the 1950s, working alongside Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart, and Neil Simon. He also published several books featuring short stories and wrote humor pieces for The New Yorker. In the early 1960s, he performed as a stand-up comedian in Greenwich Village alongside Lenny Bruce, Elaine May, Mike Nichols, and Joan Rivers. There he developed a monologue style (rather than traditional jokes) and the persona of an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish.[2] He released three comedy albums during the mid to late 1960s, earning a Grammy Award nomination for his 1964 comedy album entitled simply, Woody Allen.[3] In 2004 Comedy Central ranked Allen fourth on a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians,[4][5] while a UK survey ranked Allen the third-greatest comedian.[6]","image":"Woody_Allen_Cannes_2016.jpg.webp"}
