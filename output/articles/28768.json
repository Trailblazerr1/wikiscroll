{"title":"Mary Magdalene","summary":"Mary Magdalene,[lower-alpha 1] sometimes called Mary of Magdala, or simply the Magdalene or the Madeleine, was a woman who, according to the four canonical gospels, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion and \nresurrection.[1] She is mentioned by name twelve times in the canonical gospels, more than most of the apostles and more than any other woman in the gospels, other than Jesus's family. Mary's epithet Magdalene may mean that she came from the town of Magdala, a fishing town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee in Roman Judea.","image":"Andrea_Solario_-_Mary_Magdalen_-_Walters_37509.jpg.webp"}
