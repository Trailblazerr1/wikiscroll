{"title":"Identity (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, an identity is an equality relating one mathematical expression A to another mathematical expression B, such that A and B (which might contain some variables) produce the same value for all values of the variables within a certain range of validity.[1] In other words, A = B is an identity if A and B define the same functions, and an identity is an equality between functions that are differently defined. For example, \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        a\n        +\n        b\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        2\n        a\n        b\n        +\n        \n          b\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}}\n  \n  and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          cos\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        θ\n        +\n        \n          sin\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ⁡\n        θ\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cos ^{2}\\theta +\\sin ^{2}\\theta =1}\n  \n are identities.[1] Identities are sometimes indicated by the triple bar symbol ≡ instead of =, the equals sign.[2]","image":"088a0cbbeff707c1e8629fedd307923f5fe9d0e2.svg"}
