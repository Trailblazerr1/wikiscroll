{"title":"Protein biosynthesis","summary":"Protein biosynthesis (or protein synthesis) is a core biological process, occurring inside cells, balancing the loss of cellular proteins (via degradation or export) through the production of new proteins. Proteins perform a number of critical functions as enzymes, structural proteins or hormones. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but there are some distinct differences.[1]","image":"Summary_of_the_protein_biosynthesis_process.png.webp","url":"Protein_biosynthesis"}
