{"title":"Micelle","summary":"A micelle (/maɪˈsɛl/) or micella (/maɪˈsɛlə/) (plural micelles or micellae, respectively) is an aggregate (or supramolecular assembly) of surfactant phospholipid molecules dispersed in a liquid, forming a colloidal suspension (also known as associated colloidal system[4]). A typical micelle in water forms an aggregate with the hydrophilic \"head\" regions in contact with surrounding solvent, sequestering the hydrophobic single-tail regions in the micelle centre.","image":"Phospholipids_aqueous_solution_structures.svg.png.webp"}
