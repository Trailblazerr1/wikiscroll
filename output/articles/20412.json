{"title":"History of Afghanistan","summary":"The history of Afghanistan as a state began in 1823 as the Emirate of Afghanistan after the fall of the predecessor, the Afghan Durrani Empire, considered the founding state of modern Afghanistan.[1] Its history is tied to that of other countries in its region, mostly Pakistan, India, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.[2] The written recorded history of the land presently constituting Afghanistan can be traced back to around 500 BCE when the area was under the Achaemenid Empire,[3] although evidence indicates that an advanced degree of urbanized culture has existed in the land since between 3000 and 2000 BCE.[4][5][6] Bactria dates back to 2500 BCE.[7] The Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up to large parts of Afghanistan in the north.[8] Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army arrived at what is now Afghanistan in 330 BCE after the fall of the Achaemenid Empire during the Battle of Gaugamela.[9] Since then, many empires have established capitals in Afghanistan, including the Greco-Bactrians, Kushans, Indo-Sassanids, Kabul Shahi, Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Kartids, Timurids, Hotakis and Durranis.[10]","image":"Shuja_Shah_Durrani_of_Afghanistan_in_1839.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_Afghanistan"}
