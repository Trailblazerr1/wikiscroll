{"title":"Portuguese grammar","summary":"In Portuguese grammar, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and articles are moderately inflected: there are two genders (masculine and feminine) and two numbers (singular and plural).  The case system of the ancestor language, Latin, has been lost, but personal pronouns are still declined with three main types of forms: subject, object of verb, and object of preposition. Most nouns and many adjectives can take diminutive or augmentative derivational suffixes, and most adjectives can take a so-called \"superlative\" derivational suffix. Adjectives usually follow their respective nouns.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
