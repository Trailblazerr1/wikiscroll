{"title":"United Nations Security Council veto power","summary":"The United Nations Security Council \"veto power\" refers to the power of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) to veto any \"substantive\" resolution. However, a permanent member's abstention or absence does not prevent a draft resolution from being adopted.[1] This veto power does not apply to \"procedural\" votes, as determined by the permanent members themselves. A permanent member can also block the selection of a Secretary-General, although a formal veto is unnecessary since the vote is taken behind closed doors.","image":"United_Nations_Security_Council.jpg.webp","url":"United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power"}
