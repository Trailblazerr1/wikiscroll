{"title":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate","summary":"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP+ or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent. It is used by all forms of cellular life.[1]","image":"NADP%2B_phys.svg.png.webp"}
