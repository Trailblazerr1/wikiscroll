{"title":"Public service","summary":"A public service[1] is a service intended to serve all members of a community.[2] Public services include services provided by a government to people living within its jurisdiction, either directly through public sector agencies or by financing provision of services by private businesses or voluntary organizations (or even by family households, though terminology may differ depending on context). Other public services are undertaken on behalf of a government's residents or in the interest of its citizens. The term is associated with a social consensus (usually expressed through democratic elections) that certain services should be available to all, regardless of income, physical ability or mental acuity. Examples of such services include the fire brigade, police, air force, and paramedics (see also public service broadcasting).","image":"Tbilisi%2C_Georgia_â€”_Tbilisi_Public_Service_Hall_Building.jpg.webp","url":"Public_service"}
