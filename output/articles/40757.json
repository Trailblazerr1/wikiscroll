{"title":"Simulation","summary":"A simulation is the imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.[1] Simulations require the use of models; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or process, whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. Often, computers are used to execute the simulation.","image":"Humanités_Numériques.JPG.webp"}
