{"title":"Dextropropoxyphene","summary":"Dextropropoxyphene[3] is an analgesic in the opioid category, patented in 1955[4] and manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.  It is an optical isomer of levopropoxyphene. It is intended to treat mild pain and also has antitussive (cough suppressant) and local anaesthetic effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias.[5]\nIt is still available in Australia, albeit with restrictions after an application by its manufacturer to review its proposed banning.[6]\nIts onset of analgesia (pain relief) is said to be 20–30 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5–2.0 hours after oral administration.[1]","image":"Dextropropoxyphene_structure.svg.png.webp"}
