{"title":"Same-sex marriage in Spain","summary":"Same-sex marriage in Spain has been legal since July 3, 2005. In 2004, the nation's newly elected government, led by Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero of the Socialist Workers' Party, began a campaign to legalize same-sex marriage, including the right of adoption by same-sex couples.[1] After much debate, a law permitting same-sex marriage was passed by the Cortes Generales (the Spanish Parliament, composed of the Senate and the Congress of Deputies) on June 30, 2005 and published on July 2. The law took effect the next day,[2] making Spain the third country in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry on a national level, after the Netherlands and Belgium, and 17 days ahead of the right being extended across all of Canada.","image":"Same-sex_marriage_map_Europe_detailed.svg.png.webp","url":"Same-sex_marriage_in_Spain"}
