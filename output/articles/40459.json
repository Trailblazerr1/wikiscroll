The party is the second-oldest in India, after Congress, being founded in 1920. Although, there are many parties with the name Akali Dal but the party recognised as \"Shiromani Akali Dal\" by the Election Commission of India is the one led by Sukhbir Singh Badal. It controls Sikh religious bodies Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee and is the largest and most influential Sikh political party worldwide.[15] The basic philosophy of Akali Dal was to give a political voice to Sikh issues and it believed that religion and politics go hand in hand[16] but after 1996 the Moga Conference party adopted a moderate Punjabi secular agenda.[17] On 26 September 2020, they left the NDA over the farms bill.[18]","image":"Akali_dal_logo.png.webp","url":"Shiromani_Akali_Dal"}
