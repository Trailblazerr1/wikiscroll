{"title":"Ring species","summary":"In biology, a ring species is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which interbreeds with closely sited related populations, but for which there exist at least two \"end\" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential gene flow between each \"linked\" population.[1] Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, \"end\" populations may co-exist in the same region (sympatry) thus closing a \"ring\". The German term Rassenkreis, meaning a circle of races, is also used.","image":"Ring_Species_(gene_flow_around_a_barrier).png.webp","url":"Ring_species"}
