{"title":"Agatha Christie bibliography","summary":"Agatha Christie (1890â€“1976) was an English crime novelist, short-story writer and playwright. Her reputation rests on 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections that have sold over two billion copies, an amount surpassed only by the Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.[1] Her works contain several regular characters with whom the public became familiar, including Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, Parker Pyne and Harley Quin.[2][1] Christie wrote more Poirot stories than any of the others, even though she thought the character to be \"rather insufferable\".[2] Following the publication of the 1975 novel Curtain, Poirot's obituary appeared on the front page of The New York Times.[3][4]","image":"Agatha_Christie.png.webp","url":"Agatha_Christie_bibliography"}
