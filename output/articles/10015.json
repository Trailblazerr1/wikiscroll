{"title":"Cichlid","summary":"Cichlids /ˈsɪklɪdz/[1] are fish from the family Cichlidae in the order Cichliformes. Cichlids were traditionally classed in a suborder, the Labroidei, along with the wrasses (Labridae), in the order Perciformes,[2] but molecular studies have contradicted this grouping.[3] The closest living relative of cichlids is probably the convict blenny, and both families are classified in the 5th edition of Fishes of the World  as the two families in the Cichliformes, part of the subseries Ovalentaria.[4] This family is both large and diverse. At least 1,650 species have been scientifically described,[5] making it one of the largest vertebrate families. New species are discovered annually, and many species remain undescribed. The actual number of species is therefore unknown, with estimates varying between 2,000 and 3,000.[6]","image":"Freshwater_angelfish_biodome.jpg.webp","url":"Cichlid"}
