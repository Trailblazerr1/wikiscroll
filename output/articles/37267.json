{"title":"Reagan Doctrine","summary":"The Reagan Doctrine was stated by United States President Ronald Reagan in his State of the Union address on February 6, 1985: \"We must not break faith with those who are risking their lives—on every continent from Afghanistan to Nicaragua—to defy Soviet-supported aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth.\"[1]   It was a strategy implemented by the Reagan Administration to overwhelm the global influence of the Soviet Union in the late Cold War. The doctrine was a centerpiece of United States foreign policy from the early 1980s until the end of the Cold War in 1991.","image":"President_Reagan_posing_outside_the_oval_office_1983.jpg.webp"}
