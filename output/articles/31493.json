{"title":"Naturism","summary":"Naturism is a way of life encompassing non-sexual social nudity and the cultural movement which advocates for and defends clothes-free living. Both may also be referred to as nudism. Though the two terms are commonly interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated.[1] That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology.","image":"FYN_06.jpg.webp"}
