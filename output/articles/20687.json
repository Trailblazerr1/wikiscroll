{"title":"Home run","summary":"In baseball, a home run (abbreviated HR) is scored when the ball is hit in such a way that the batter is able to circle the bases and reach home safely in one play without any errors being committed by the defensive team in the process. In modern baseball, the feat is typically achieved by hitting the ball over the outfield fence between the foul poles (or making contact with either foul pole) without first touching the ground, resulting in an automatic home run.  There is also the \"inside-the-park\" home run where the batter reaches home safely while the baseball is in play on the field.","image":"20060825_Barry_Bonds_follow_through.jpg.webp"}
