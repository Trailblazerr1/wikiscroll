The episode follows the protagonist, an anthropomorphic young sea sponge, attempting to get a job at a local fast food restaurant called the Krusty Krab. However, he is tasked to find an apparently rare high-caliber spatula because the owner, Mr. Krabs, considers him unqualified for the position. Eventually, crowds of ravenous anchovies stop by the Krusty Krab and demand meals. SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula. He utilizes the spatula to satisfy the anchovies' hunger. SpongeBob is then welcomed by Mr. Krabs as a Krusty Krab employee against the wishes of Squidward Tentacles, the cashier of the Krusty Krab.","image":"SpongeBob_SquarePants_Help_Wanted_title-card.jpg.webp","url":"Help_Wanted_(SpongeBob_SquarePants)"}
