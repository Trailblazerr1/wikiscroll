{"title":"Jean Peters","summary":"Elizabeth Jean Peters (October 15, 1926 â€“ October 13, 2000) was an American film actress. She is known as a star of 20th Century Fox in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and as the second wife of Howard Hughes. Although possibly best remembered for her siren role in Pickup on South Street (1953), Peters was known for her resistance to being turned into a sex symbol. She preferred to play unglamorous, down-to-earth women.[1]","image":"JEANPeters.jpg.webp"}
