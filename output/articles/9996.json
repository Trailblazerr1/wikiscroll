{"title":"Church of the Holy Sepulchre","summary":"The Church of the Holy Sepulchre[lower-alpha 1] is a church in the Christian Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.[1] According to traditions dating back to the fourth century, it contains the two holiest sites in Christianity: the site where Jesus was crucified,[2] at a place known as Calvary or Golgotha, and Jesus's empty tomb, where he is believed by Christians to have been buried and resurrected.[3] The tomb is enclosed by a 19th-century shrine called the Aedicula. The Status Quo, an understanding between religious communities dating to 1757, applies to the site.[4][5]","image":"Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre_by_Gerd_Eichmann_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulchre"}
