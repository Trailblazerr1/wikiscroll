{"title":"Diesel multiple unit","summary":"A diesel multiple unit or DMU is a multiple-unit train powered by on-board diesel engines. A DMU requires no separate locomotive, as the engines are incorporated into one or more of the carriages. Diesel-powered single-unit railcars are also generally classed as DMUs. Diesel-powered units may be further classified by their transmission type:  diesel–mechanical DMMU, diesel–hydraulic DHMU, or diesel–electric DEMU.","image":"JNR_kiha40_136_erimo.jpg.webp"}
