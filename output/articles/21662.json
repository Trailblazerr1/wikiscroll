{"title":"Imine","summary":"An imine (/ɪˈmiːn/ or /ˈɪmɪn/) is a functional group or chemical compound containing a carbon–nitrogen double bond. The nitrogen atom can be attached to a hydrogen (H) or an organic group (R).  If this group is not a hydrogen atom, then the compound can sometimes be referred to as a Schiff base.[1] The carbon atom has two additional single bonds.[2][3][4]  The term \"imine\" was coined in 1883 by the German chemist Albert Ladenburg.[5]","image":"Imine_general_structure_B.svg.png.webp","url":"Imine"}
