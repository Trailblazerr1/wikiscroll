{"title":"Kannada script","summary":"The Kannada script (IAST: Kanna·∏ça lipi; obsolete: Kanarese or Canarese script in English) is an abugida of the Brahmic family,[6] used primarily to write Kannada, one of the Dravidian languages of South India especially in the state of Karnataka. Kannada script is widely used for writing Sanskrit texts in Karnataka. Several minor languages, such as Tulu, Konkani, Kodava, Sanketi and Beary, also use alphabets based on the Kannada script.[7] The Kannada and Telugu scripts share high mutual intellegibility with each other, and are often considered to be regional variants of single script. Other scripts similar to Kannada script are Sinhala script[8] (which included some elements from the Kadamba script[9]), and Old Peguan script\n(used in Burma).[10]","image":"Kavi_file2.jpg.webp"}
