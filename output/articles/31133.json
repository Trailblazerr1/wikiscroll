(often called the \"mothership\" of NPR), with its NPR West headquarters in Culver City, California.[2] It differs from other non-profit membership media organizations such as Associated Press, in that it was established by an act of Congress,[3] and most of its member stations are owned by government entities (often public universities). It serves as a national syndicator to a network of over 1,000 public radio stations in the United States.[4]","image":"National_Public_Radio_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"NPR"}
