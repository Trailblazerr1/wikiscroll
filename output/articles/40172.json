{"title":"Severe weather","summary":"Severe weather is any dangerous meteorological phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.[1][2][3]  Types of severe weather phenomena vary, depending on the latitude, altitude, topography, and atmospheric conditions.  High winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, downbursts, tornadoes, waterspouts, tropical cyclones, and extratropical cyclones.  Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include blizzards (snowstorms), ice storms, and duststorms.[4] Extreme weather phenomena which cause extreme heat, cold, wetness or drought often will bring severe weather events. One of the principle effects of anthropogenic climate change is changes in severe and extreme weather patterns.","image":"Severe_weather_montage.jpg.webp","url":"Severe_weather"}
