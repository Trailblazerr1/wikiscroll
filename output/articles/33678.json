{"title":"Palace of Whitehall","summary":"The Palace of Whitehall (or Palace of White Hall) at Westminster, Middlesex, was the main residence of the English monarchs from 1530 until 1698, when most of its structures, except notably Inigo Jones's Banqueting House of 1622, were destroyed by fire. Henry VIII moved the royal residence to White Hall after the old royal apartments at the nearby Palace of Westminster were themselves destroyed by fire.  Although the Whitehall palace does not survive, the area where it was located is still called Whitehall and has remained a centre of government.","image":"The_Old_Palace_of_Whitehall_by_Hendrik_Danckerts.jpg.webp","url":"Palace_of_Whitehall"}
