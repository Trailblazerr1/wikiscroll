{"title":"Explosion","summary":"An explosion is a rapid expansion in volume associated with an extremely vigorous outward release of energy, usually with the generation of high temperatures and release of high-pressure gases.  Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel through shock waves.  Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower combustion process known as deflagration.","image":"NTS_-_BEEF_-_WATUSI.jpg.webp","url":"Explosion"}
