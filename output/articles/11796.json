{"title":"Cycling infrastructure","summary":"Cycling infrastructure refers to all infrastructure permissible for use by cyclists, including the network of roads and streets used by motorists, except where cyclists are excluded (e.g., many freeways/motorways), along with bikeways from which motor vehicles are excluded â€“ including bike paths, bike lanes, cycle tracks, rail trails and, where permitted, sidewalks.  Cycling infrastructure also includes amenities such as bike racks for parking, shelters, service centers and specialized traffic signs and signals. Cycling modal share is strongly associated with the size of local cycling infrastructure.[1]","image":"Fietspad_PeeWee32.jpg.webp"}
