{"title":"Atrial septal defect","summary":"Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital heart defect in which blood flows between the atria (upper chambers) of the heart.  Some flow is a normal condition both pre-birth and immediately post-birth via the foramen ovale; however, when this does not naturally close after birth it is referred to as a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO). It is common in patients with a congenital atrial septal aneurysm (ASA).","image":"Asd-web.jpg.webp","url":"Atrial_septal_defect"}
