{"title":"Palestinian territories","summary":"The term \"Palestinian territories\" has been used for many years to describe the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 within the former British Mandate for Palestine, namely the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has referred to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as \"the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" and this term was used as the legal definition by the ICJ in the ruling in July 2004.[7] More recently, the official United Nations (UN) terminology[8] has been used, occupied Palestinian territory[9][10][11] (OPT or oPt) increasingly replacing other terms since 1999.[12] The European Union (EU) also has adopted this usage.[13][14] The term Occupied Palestinian Territory was used by the UN and other international organizations between October 1999[15] and December 2012 to refer to areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority. The EU had utilized a parallel term Palestinian Authority territories[16][17][18] occasionally during the same period.","image":"Palestinian_territories_(orthographic_projection).svg.png.webp"}
