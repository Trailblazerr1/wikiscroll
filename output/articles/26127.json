{"title":"Lifestyle (sociology)","summary":"Lifestyle is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations of an individual, group, or culture.[1][2] The term was introduced by Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler in his 1929 book, The Case of Miss R., with the meaning of \"a person's basic character as established early in childhood\".[3] The broader sense of lifestyle as a \"way or style of living\" has been documented since 1961.[3] Lifestyle is a combination of determining intangible or tangible factors. Tangible factors relate specifically to demographic variables, i.e. an individual's demographic profile, whereas intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such as personal values, preferences, and outlooks.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
