{"title":"Private banking","summary":"Private banking is banking, investment and other financial services provided by banks and financial institutions primarily serving high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) â€” defined as those with very high levels of income or sizable assets. Private banking is a more exclusive  subset of wealth management, geared toward exceptionally affluent clients. The term \"private\" refers to customer service rendered on a more personal basis than in mass-market retail banking, usually provided via dedicated bank advisers. At least until recently, it largely consisted of banking services (deposit taking and payments), discretionary asset management, brokerage, limited tax advisory services and some basic concierge-type services, offered by a single designated relationship manager.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
