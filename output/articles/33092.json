{"title":"Opera","summary":"Opera  is a form of theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers, but is distinct from musical theatre.[1] Such a \"work\" (the literal translation of the Italian word \"opera\") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist[2] and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.","image":"Teatro_alla_Scala_interior_Milan.jpg.webp","url":"Opera"}
