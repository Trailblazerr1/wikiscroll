{"title":"Slavic Native Faith","summary":"The Slavic Native Faith, commonly known as Rodnovery[lower-greek 1] and sometimes as Slavic Neopaganism,[lower-greek 2] is a modern Pagan religion. Classified as a new religious movement, its practitioners harken back to the historical belief systems of the Slavic peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, though the movement is inclusive of external influences and hosts a variety of currents. \"Rodnovery\" is a widely accepted self-descriptor within the community, although there are Rodnover organisations which further characterise the religion as Vedism, Orthodoxy, and Old Belief.","image":"Red_Rodnover_kolovrat.svg.png.webp","url":"Slavic_Native_Faith"}
