{"title":"Crop circle","summary":"A crop circle, crop formation, or corn circle is a pattern created by flattening a crop,[1] usually a cereal. The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews.[2] Crop circles have been described as all falling \"within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes\" by Taner Edis, professor of physics at Truman State University.[3] Although obscure natural causes or alien origins of crop circles are suggested by fringe theorists,[4] there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation.[5][6][7]","image":"CropCircleW.jpg.webp"}
