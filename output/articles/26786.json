{"title":"List of colonial governors of New Jersey","summary":"The territory which would later become the state of New Jersey was settled by Dutch and Swedish colonists in the early seventeenth century. In 1664, at the onset of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, English forces under Richard Nicolls ousted the Dutch from control of New Netherland (present-day New York, New Jersey, and Delaware), and the territory was divided into several newly defined English colonies. Despite one brief year when the Dutch retook the colony (1673â€“74), New Jersey would remain an English possession until the American colonies declared independence in 1776.","image":"ProprietaryHousePerthAmboy.JPG.webp"}
