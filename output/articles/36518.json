{"title":"Pump organ","summary":"The pump organ is a type of free-reed organ that generates sound as air flows past a vibrating piece of thin metal in a frame. The piece of metal is called a reed. Specific types of pump organ include the reed organ, harmonium, and melodeon. The idea for the free reed was imported from China through Russia after 1750, and the first Western free-reed instrument was made in 1780 in Denmark.[1][2]","image":"John_Church_and_Co._reed_organ.jpg.webp","url":"Pump_organ"}
