{"title":"Wrestling","summary":"Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling-type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. The sport can either be genuinely competitive or sportive entertainment (see professional wrestling). Wrestling comes in different forms such as folkstyle, freestyle, Greco-Roman, catch, submission, judo, sambo and others.[1] A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (sometimes more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules, with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems. The term wrestling is attested in late Old English, as wr√¶stlunge (glossing palestram).[2]","image":"Wrestling_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics%2C_Gazyumov_vs_Andriitsev_6.jpg.webp"}
