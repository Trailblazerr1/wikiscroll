{"title":"Glycolysis","summary":"Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvic acid, CH3COCOOH. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).[1][2]  Glycolysis is a sequence of ten reactions catalyzed by enzymes.","image":"Glycolysis_metabolic_pathway_3.svg.png.webp"}
