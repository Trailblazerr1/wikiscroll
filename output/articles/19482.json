{"title":"Ham House","summary":"Ham House is a 17th-century house set in formal gardens on the bank of the River Thames in Ham, south of Richmond in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames.  The original house was completed by 1610 by Thomas Vavasour, an Elizabethan courtier and Knight Marshal to James I. It was then leased, and later bought,  by William Murray, a close friend and supporter of Charles I. The English Civil War saw the house and much of the estate sequestrated but Murray's wife Katherine regained them on payment of a fine. During the Protectorate, his daughter Elizabeth, Countess of Dysart on her fatherâ€™s death in 1655, successfully navigated the prevailing anti-Royalist sentiment and retained control of the estate.","image":"Ham_House%2C_London.jpg.webp"}
