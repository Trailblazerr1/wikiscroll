{"title":"Batavian Republic","summary":"The Batavian Republic (Dutch: Bataafse Republiek; French: RÃ©publique Batave) was the successor state to the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. It was proclaimed on 19 January 1795 and ended on 5 June 1806, with the accession of Louis I to the Dutch throne. From October 1801 onward, it was known as the Batavian Commonwealth (Dutch: Bataafs Gemenebest). Both names refer to the Germanic tribe of the Batavi, representing both the Dutch ancestry and their ancient quest for liberty in their nationalistic lore.","image":"Bataafse_Republiek_nationale_vlag.svg.png.webp","url":"Batavian_Republic"}
