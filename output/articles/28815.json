{"title":"Masoretic Text","summary":"The Masoretic Text[lower-alpha 1] (MT or 𝕸; Hebrew: נוסח המסורה‎, romanized: Nusakh haMasora) is the authoritative Hebrew and Aramaic text of the 24 books of the Tanakh in Rabbinic Judaism. The Masoretic Text defines the Jewish canon and its precise letter-text, with its vocalization and accentuation known as the masorah. Referring to the Masoretic Text, mesorah specifically means the diacritic markings of the text of the Hebrew scriptures and the concise marginal notes in manuscripts (and later printings) of the Tanakh which note textual details, usually about the precise spelling of words. It was primarily copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Christ Era (CE). The oldest-known complete copy, the Leningrad Codex, dates from the early 11th century CE.","image":"Leningrad_Codex_Carpet_page_e.jpg.webp"}
