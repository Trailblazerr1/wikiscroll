{"title":"Post-resurrection appearances of Jesus","summary":"The post-resurrection appearances of Jesus in the canonical gospels (and to a lesser extent other books of the New Testament) are reported to have occurred after Jesus' death, burial and resurrection, but prior to his ascension.[note 1] Among these sources, most scholars believe the First Epistle to the Corinthians was written first. Most Christians point to the appearances as evidence of his bodily resurrection and identity as Messiah, seated in Heaven on the right hand of God (the doctrine of the Exaltation of Christ).[1] Others, including Liberal Christians, interpret these accounts as visionary experiences.","image":"Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg.webp"}
