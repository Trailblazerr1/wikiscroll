{"title":"Colossal squid","summary":"The colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni) is part of the family Cranchiidae.[3] It is sometimes called the Antarctic squid or giant cranch squid and is believed to be the largest squid species in terms of mass.[4] It is the only recognized member of the genus Mesonychoteuthis and is known from only a small number of specimens.[5] The species is confirmed to reach a mass of at least 495 kilograms (1,091 lb), though the largest specimens—known only from beaks found in sperm whale stomachs—may perhaps weigh as much as 600–700 kilograms (1,300–1,500 lb),[6][7] making it the largest-known invertebrate.[4] Maximum total length has been estimated at 9–10 metres (30–33 ft).[8]","image":"Colossalsquid.png.webp","url":"Colossal_squid"}
