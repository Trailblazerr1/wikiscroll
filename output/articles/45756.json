{"title":"Transcriptomics technologies","summary":"Transcriptomics technologies are the techniques used to study an organism's transcriptome, the sum of all of its RNA transcripts. The information content of an organism is recorded in the DNA of its genome and expressed through transcription. Here, mRNA serves as a transient intermediary molecule in the information network, whilst non-coding RNAs perform additional diverse functions. A transcriptome captures a snapshot in time of the total transcripts present in a cell. Transcriptomics technologies provide a broad account of which cellular processes are active and which are dormant.\nA major challenge in molecular biology lies in understanding how the same genome can give rise to different cell types and how gene expression is regulated.","image":"Transcriptomics_technique_publications_over_time.svg.png.webp"}
