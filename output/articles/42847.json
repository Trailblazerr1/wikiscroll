{"title":"Supermassive black hole","summary":"A supermassive black hole (SMBH or sometimes SBH)[4] is the largest type of black hole, with mass on the order of millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun (Mâ˜‰). Black holes are a class of astronomical objects that have undergone gravitational collapse, leaving behind spheroidal regions of space from which nothing can escape, not even light. Observational evidence indicates that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center.[5][6] The Milky Way has a supermassive black hole in its Galactic Center, which corresponds to the location of Sagittarius A*.[7][8] Accretion of interstellar gas onto supermassive black holes is the process responsible for powering active galactic nuclei and quasars.[9]","image":"Black_hole_-_Messier_87.jpg.webp","url":"Supermassive_black_hole"}
