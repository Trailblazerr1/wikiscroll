{"title":"Compact operator","summary":"In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, a compact operator is a linear operator \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n        :\n        X\n        â†’\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T:X\\to Y}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X,Y}\n  \n are normed vector spaces, with the property that \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n maps bounded subsets of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n to relatively compact subsets of \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n (subsets with compact closure in \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n). Such an operator is necessarily a bounded operator, and so continuous.[1] Some authors require that \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X,Y}\n  \n are Banach, but the definition can be extended to more general spaces.","image":"d961a4704b054500d6ecff6b4caac6852982458c.svg"}
