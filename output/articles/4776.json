{"title":"Atelectasis","summary":"Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange.  It is usually unilateral, affecting part or all of one lung.[2] It is a condition where the alveoli are deflated down to little or no volume, as distinct from pulmonary consolidation, in which they are filled with liquid. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to pneumothorax.[1]","image":"Atelectasia1.jpg.webp","url":"Atelectasis"}
