{"title":"Nefazodone","summary":"Nefazodone, sold formerly under the brand names Serzone, Dutonin, and Nefadar among others, is an atypical antidepressant which was first marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1994 but has since largely been discontinued.[3][4][5][6] BMS withdrew it from the market by 2004 due to decreasing sales due to the rare incidence of severe liver damage and the onset of generic competition. The incidence of severe liver damage is approximately 1 in every 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years.[7] Generic versions were introduced in 2003.[8]","image":"Nefazodone.svg.png.webp","url":"Nefazodone"}
