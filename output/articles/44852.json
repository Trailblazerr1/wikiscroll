{"title":"Theotokos","summary":"Theotokos[lower-alpha 1] (Greek: Θεοτόκος, Greek pronunciation: [θeoˈtokos]) is a title of Mary, mother of Jesus, used especially in Eastern Christianity. The usual Latin translations are Dei Genitrix or Deipara (approximately \"parent (fem.) of God\"). Familiar English translations are \"Mother of God\" or \"God-bearer\" – but these both have different literal equivalents in Greek, Μήτηρ Θεοῦ and Θεοφόρος (\"who gave birth to one who was God\", \"whose child was God\", respectively).[1][2]","image":"Kazan_moscow.jpg.webp"}
