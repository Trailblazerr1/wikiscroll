{"title":"A Streetcar Named Marge","summary":"\"A Streetcar Named Marge\" is the second episode of the fourth season of the American animated television series The Simpsons. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 1, 1992. In the episode, Marge wins the role of Blanche DuBois in a community theatre musical version of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. Homer offers little support for his wife's acting pursuits, and Marge begins to see parallels between him and Stanley Kowalski, the play's boorish lead male character. The episode contains a subplot in which Maggie Simpson attempts to retrieve her pacifier from a strict daycare owner.","image":"Jameslbrooks.jpg.webp","url":"A_Streetcar_Named_Marge"}
