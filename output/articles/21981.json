{"title":"Informbiro period","summary":"The Informbiro period was an era of Yugoslavia's history following the Tito–Stalin split in mid-1948 that lasted until the country's rapprochement with the Soviet Union in 1955. After World War II in Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia's new leadership under Josip Broz Tito pursued a foreign policy that did not align with the interests of the Eastern Bloc. Eventually, this led to public conflict, but the Yugoslav leadership decided not to acquiesce to Soviet demands, despite significant external and internal pressures. The period saw the persecution of the political opposition in Yugoslavia, resulting in thousands being killed, imprisoned, exiled, or sent to forced labour. The purges included a significant number of members of Yugoslavia's security apparatus and its military.","image":"SocialistYugoslavia_en.svg.png.webp","url":"Informbiro_period"}
