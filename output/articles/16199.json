{"title":"Fine-structure constant","summary":"In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as Sommerfeld's constant, commonly denoted by α (the Greek letter alpha), is a fundamental physical constant which quantifies the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It is a dimensionless quantity related to the elementary charge e, which denotes the strength of the coupling of an elementary charged particle with the electromagnetic field, by the formula 4πε0ħcα = e2.  As a dimensionless quantity, its numerical value, approximately 1/137, is independent of the system of units used.","image":"Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png.webp","url":"Fine-structure_constant"}
