{"title":"Acinetobacter baumannii","summary":"Acinetobacter baumannii is a typically short, almost round, rod-shaped (coccobacillus) Gram-negative bacterium. It is named after the bacteriologist Paul Baumann.[2] It can be an opportunistic pathogen in humans, affecting people with compromised immune systems, and is becoming increasingly important as a hospital-derived (nosocomial) infection. While other species of the genus Acinetobacter are often found in soil samples (leading to the common misconception that A. baumannii is a soil organism, too), it is almost exclusively isolated from hospital environments.[3] Although occasionally it has been found in environmental soil and water samples,[4] its natural habitat is still not known.","image":"A.baumannii_visualized_using_Scanning_electron_microscopy.png.webp"}
