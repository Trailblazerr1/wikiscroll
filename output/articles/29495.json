{"title":"Metamaterial","summary":"A metamaterial (from the Greek word μετά meta, meaning \"beyond\" and the Latin word materia, meaning \"matter\" or \"material\") is any material engineered to have a property that is not found in naturally occurring materials. They are made from assemblies of multiple elements fashioned from composite materials such as metals and plastics. The materials are usually arranged in repeating patterns, at scales that are smaller than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Metamaterials derive their properties not from the properties of the base materials, but from their newly designed structures. Their precise shape, geometry, size, orientation and arrangement gives them their smart properties capable of manipulating electromagnetic waves: by blocking, absorbing, enhancing, or bending waves, to achieve benefits that go beyond what is possible with conventional materials.","image":"Split-ring_resonator_array_10K_sq_nm.jpg.webp"}
