{"title":"Samosa","summary":"A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) is a South Asian[2] fried or baked pastry with a savory filling like spiced potatoes, onions, peas, chicken and other meats, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.[3] Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the local cuisines of South Asia. Due to emigration and cultural diffusion from these areas, samosas today are often prepared in other regions.","image":"Samosachutney.jpg.webp"}
