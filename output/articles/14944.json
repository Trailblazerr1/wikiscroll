{"title":"Eoraptor","summary":"Eoraptor (/ˈiːoʊˌræptər/) is a genus of small, lightly built, basal sauropodomorph. One of the earliest-known dinosaurs, it lived approximately 231 to 228 million years ago,[1] during the Late Triassic in Western Gondwana, in the region that is now northwestern Argentina. The type and only species, Eoraptor lunensis, was first described in 1993, and is known from an almost complete and well-preserved skeleton and several fragmentary ones. Eoraptor had multiple tooth shapes, which suggests that it was omnivorous.","image":"Royal_Ontario_Museum_Eoraptor.JPG.webp","url":"Eoraptor"}
