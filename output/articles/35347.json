{"title":"Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle","summary":"The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is an expendable medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). It was developed to allow India to launch its Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites into sun-synchronous orbits, a service that was, until the advent of the PSLV in 1993, commercially available only from Russia. PSLV can also launch small size satellites into Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO).[8]","image":"PSLV_C-35_at_the_launch_pad_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Polar_Satellite_Launch_Vehicle"}
