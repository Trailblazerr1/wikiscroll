{"title":"Ancestral Puebloans","summary":"The Ancestral Puebloans, also known as the Anasazi, were an ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States, comprising southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado.[1] They are believed to have developed, at least in part, from the Oshara Tradition, which developed from the Picosa culture. The people and their archaeological culture are often referred to as Anasazi, meaning \"ancient enemies\", as they were called by Navajo. Contemporary Puebloans object to the use of this term.[2][3]","image":"Mesaverde_cliffpalace_20030914.752.jpg.webp"}
