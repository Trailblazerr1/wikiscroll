After one year of college basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the 76ers. Multiple foot and knee injuries delayed his debut for two seasons until 2016–17, when he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team despite playing only 31 games. Embiid has received four All-Star selections. He has nicknamed himself \"the Process\" in response to a refrain from 76ers fans during the Sam Hinkie era to \"trust the process\".[4][5][6][7]","image":"Joel_Embiid_2019.jpg.webp","url":"Joel_Embiid"}
