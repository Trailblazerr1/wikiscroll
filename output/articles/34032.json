{"title":"Parvoviridae","summary":"Parvoviruses are a family of animal viruses that constitute the family Parvoviridae. They have linear, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes that typically contain two genes encoding for a replication initiator protein, called NS1, and the protein the viral capsid is made of. The coding portion of the genome is flanked by telomeres at each end that form into hairpin loops that are important during replication. Parvovirus virions are small compared to most viruses, at 23â€“28 nanometers in diameter, and contain the genome enclosed in an icosahedral capsid that has a rugged surface.","image":"Canines_Parvovirus.jpg.webp","url":"Parvoviridae"}
