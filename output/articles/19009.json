{"title":"Grilling","summary":"Grilling is a form of cooking that involves dry heat applied to the surface of food, commonly from above, below or from the side.[1] Grilling usually involves a significant amount of direct, radiant heat, and tends to be used for cooking meat and vegetables quickly. Food to be grilled is cooked on a grill (an open wire grid such as a gridiron with a heat source above or below), using a cast iron/frying pan, or a grill pan (similar to a frying pan, but with raised ridges to mimic the wires of an open grill).","image":"Grillen_-_BBQ_-_Barbeque_-_Fleisch_auf_dem_Grill.jpg.webp","url":"Grilling"}
