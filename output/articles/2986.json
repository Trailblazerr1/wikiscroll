{"title":"Allele","summary":"An allele (UK: /ˈæliːl/, /əˈliːl/; US: /əˈliːl/; modern formation from Greek ἄλλος állos, \"other\")[1][2][3] is one of two, or more, forms of a given gene variant.[4] For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles. Nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.[5][6] An allele is one of two, or more, versions of the same gene at the same place on a chromosome. It can also refer to one of multiple different sequence variations of several-hundred base-pairs long or longer regions of the genome that code for proteins. Alleles can come in different extremes of size. At the lowest extreme, an allele can be a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).[7] At higher extremes, it can be up to several thousand base-pairs long.[8][9] Most alleles result in little or no observable change in the function of the protein the gene codes for.","image":"Deep_Blue_eye.jpg.webp"}
