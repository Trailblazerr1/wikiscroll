{"title":"Saturated fat","summary":"A saturated fat is a type of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all single bonds.  A fat known as a glyceride is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: a short glycerol backbone and fatty acids that each contain a long linear or branched chain of carbon (C) atoms. Along the chain, some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-).[1] A double bond along the carbon chain can react with a pair of hydrogen atoms to change into a single -C-C- bond, with each H atom now bonded to one of the two C atoms. Glyceride fats without any carbon chain double bonds are called saturated because they are \"saturated with\" hydrogen atoms, having no double bonds available to react with more hydrogen.","image":"Fat_composition_in_foods.png.webp","url":"Saturated_fat"}
