{"title":"Microsoft Defender","summary":"Windows Security (known as Windows Defender Antivirus before Windows 10 May 2020 Update, Windows Defender before Windows 10 Creators Update, or Microsoft Defender Antivirus before Windows 11) is an anti-malware component of Microsoft Windows. It was first released as a downloadable free anti-spyware program for Windows XP, and was later shipped with Windows Vista and Windows 7. It has evolved into a full antivirus program, replacing Microsoft Security Essentials, as part of Windows 8 and later versions.[3] Compared to other antivirus, Microsoft Defender lacks advanced security features such as a password protector, sandbox, or website phishing checker, yet it offers protection against malware installed on the computer.","image":"Microsoft_Defender_2020_Fluent_Design_icon.png.webp"}
