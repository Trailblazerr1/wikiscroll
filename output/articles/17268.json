{"title":"GNU Hurd","summary":"GNU Hurd is a collection of microkernel servers written as part of GNU, for the Mach kernel. It has been under development since 1990 by the GNU Project of the Free Software Foundation, designed as a replacement for the Unix kernel,[3] and released as free software under the GNU General Public License. When the Linux kernel proved to be a viable solution, development of GNU Hurd slowed, at times alternating between stasis and renewed activity and interest.[4]","image":"Hurd-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"GNU_Hurd"}
