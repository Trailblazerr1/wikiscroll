{"title":"Reactive arthritis","summary":"Reactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a form of inflammatory arthritis[1] that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body (cross-reactivity). Coming into contact with bacteria and developing an infection can trigger the disease.[2] By the time the patient presents with symptoms, often the \"trigger\" infection has been cured or is in remission in chronic cases, thus making determination of the initial cause difficult.","image":"SOA-arthritis.jpg.webp"}
