{"title":"Inverted Jenny","summary":"The Inverted Jenny (also known as an Upside Down Jenny, Jenny Invert) is a 24 cent United States postage stamp first issued on May 10, 1918, in which the image of the Curtiss JN-4 airplane in the center of the design is printed upside-down; it is probably the most famous error in American philately. Only one pane of 100 of the invert stamps was ever found, making this error one of the most prized in philately.","image":"US_Airmail_inverted_Jenny_24c_1918_issue.jpg.webp","url":"Inverted_Jenny"}
