{"title":"Predicate (mathematical logic)","summary":"In logic, a predicate is a symbol which represents a property or a relation. For instance, the first order formula \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        (\n        a\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P(a)}\n  \n, the symbol \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  \n is a predicate which applies to the individual constant \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n. Similarly, in the formula \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n        (\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R(a,b)}\n  \n the predicate \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n is a predicate which applies to the individual constants \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  \n.","image":"87843d318d662e597ebd3c0260bcb2727707009d.svg"}
