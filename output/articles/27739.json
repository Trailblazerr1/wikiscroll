{"title":"M. F. Husain","summary":"Maqbool Fida Husain[2] (17 September 1915 – 9 June 2011)[3][4] was an Indian artist known for executing bold, vibrantly coloured narrative paintings in a modified Cubist style.[5] He was one of the most celebrated and internationally recognised Indian artists of the 20th century.[5] He was one of the founding members of Bombay Progressive Artists' Group.\nM.F. Husain is associated with Indian modernism in the 1940s. His early association with the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group used modern technique, and was inspired by the \"new\" India after the partition of 1947. His narrative paintings, executed in a modified Cubist style, can be caustic and funny as well as serious and sombre. His themes—sometimes treated in series—include topics as diverse as Gandhi, Mother Teresa, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the British Raj, and motifs of Indian urban and rural life. In September 2020, his painting titled “Voices”, auctioned for a record $2.5 million.[6]","image":"MFHussain2.jpg.webp"}
