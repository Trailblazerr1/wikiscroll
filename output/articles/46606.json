{"title":"Union Jack","summary":"The Union Jack,[note 1][2][3] or Union Flag, is the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom. Though no law has been passed officially making the Union Jack the national flag of the United Kingdom, it has effectively become the national flag through precedent. The flag has official status in Canada, by parliamentary resolution, where it is known as the Royal Union Flag.[4] As they are localities within the British state, or realm, it is the national flag of all of the British overseas territories, although local flags (usually the blue or red ensign with the Union Flag in the canton and defaced with the distinguishing arms of the territory) have also been authorised for most, which may be flown in place of, or along with (but taking precedence after) the national flag. Governors of British Overseas Territories have their own flags, which are the Union flag with the distinguishing arms of the colony at the centre. The Union Flag also appears in the canton (upper flagpole-side quarter) of the flags of several nations and territories that are former British possessions or dominions, as well as that of Hawaii. The claim that the term Union Jack properly refers only to naval usage has been disputed, following historical investigations by the Flag Institute in 2013.[5][6][note 2]","image":"Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png.webp"}
