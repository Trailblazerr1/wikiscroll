{"title":"Australian legal system","summary":"The legal system of Australia has multiple forms. It includes a written constitution, unwritten constitutional conventions, statutes, regulations, and the judicially determined common law system. Its legal institutions and traditions are substantially derived from that of the English legal system.[1] Australia is a common-law jurisdiction, its court system having originated in the common law system of English law. The country's common law is enforced uniformly across the states (subject to augmentation by statutes).[2]","image":"High_Court_of_Australia_from_lake_(85856224)_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Australian_legal_system"}
