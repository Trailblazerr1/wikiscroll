{"title":"Ionizing radiation","summary":"Ionizing (or ionising) radiation consists of subatomic particles or electromagnetic waves that have sufficient energy to ionize atoms or molecules by detaching electrons from them.[1] The particles generally travel at a speed that is greater than 1% of that of light, and the electromagnetic waves are on the high-energy portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.","image":"Alfa_beta_gamma_neutron_radiation.svg.png.webp"}
