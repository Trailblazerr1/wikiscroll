{"title":"Veal","summary":"Veal is the meat of  calves, in contrast to the beef from older cattle. Veal can be produced from a calf of either sex and any breed, however most veal comes from young male calves of dairy breeds which are not used for breeding.[1][2] Generally, veal is more expensive per pound than beef from older cattle. Veal production is a way to add value to dairy bull calves and to utilize whey solids, a byproduct from the manufacturing of cheese.[3]","image":"Holstein_cow_with_one-day_calf_01.jpg.webp","url":"Veal"}
