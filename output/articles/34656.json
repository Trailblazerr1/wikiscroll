{"title":"Petiole (botany)","summary":"In botany, the petiole (/ˈpiːtioʊl/) is the stalk that attaches the leaf blade to the stem,[1]: 87 [2]: 171  and is able to twist the leaf to face the sun. This gives a characteristic foliage arrangement to the plant.[3] Outgrowths appearing on each side of the petiole in some species are called stipules. Leaves with a petiole are said to be petiolate, while leaves lacking a petiole are called sessile or apetiolate.
