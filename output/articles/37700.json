{"title":"Resident Evil – Code: Veronica","summary":"Resident Evil – Code: Veronica[lower-alpha 1] is a survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom and released for the Dreamcast in 2000. It is a major installment in the Resident Evil series and the first to debut on a separate platform from the PlayStation. The story takes place three months after the events of Resident Evil 2 (1998) and the concurrent destruction of Raccoon City as seen in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999). It follows Claire Redfield and her brother Chris Redfield in their efforts to survive a viral outbreak at both a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean and a research facility in Antarctica. The game retains the traditional survival horror controls and gameplay seen in previous series installments; however, unlike the pre-rendered backgrounds of previous games, Code: Veronica utilizes real-time 3D environments and dynamic camera movement.","image":"RECV_boxart.jpg.webp","url":"Resident_Evil_–_Code:_Veronica"}
