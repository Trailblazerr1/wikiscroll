{"title":"Riemann hypothesis","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 1/2. Many consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in pure mathematics.[1] It is of great interest in number theory because it implies results about the distribution of prime numbers. It was proposed by Bernhard RiemannÂ (1859), after whom it is named.","image":"RiemannCriticalLine.svg.png.webp","url":"Riemann_hypothesis"}
