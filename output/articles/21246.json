{"title":"Hydrogen peroxide","summary":"Hydrogen peroxide is a chemical compound with the formula H2O2. In its pure form, it is a very pale blue[5] liquid, slightly more viscous than water. It is used as an oxidizer, bleaching agent, and antiseptic, usually as a dilute solution (3â€“6% by weight) in water for consumer use, and in higher concentrations for industrial use.  Concentrated hydrogen peroxide, or \"high-test peroxide\", decomposes explosively when heated and has been used as a propellant in rocketry.[6]","image":"Wasserstoffperoxid.svg.png.webp"}
