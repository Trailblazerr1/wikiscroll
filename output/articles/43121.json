{"title":"Syndrome","summary":"A syndrome is a set of medical signs and symptoms which are correlated with each other and often associated with a particular disease or disorder.[1] The word derives from the Greek σύνδρομον, meaning \"concurrence\".[2]: 1818  When a syndrome is paired with a definite cause this becomes a disease.[3] The discipline that deals with the diagnosis of syndromes is also referred to as syndromology or dysmorphology. In some instances, a syndrome is so closely linked with a pathogenesis or cause that the words syndrome, disease, and disorder end up being used interchangeably for them. This substitution of terminology often confuses the reality and meaning of medical diagnoses.[3] This is especially true of inherited syndromes. About one third of all phenotypes that are listed in OMIM are described as dysmorphic, which usually refers to the facial gestalt. For example, Down syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, and Andersen–Tawil syndrome are disorders with known pathogeneses, so each is more than just a set of signs and symptoms, despite the syndrome nomenclature. In other instances, a syndrome is not specific to only one disease. For example, toxic shock syndrome can be caused by various toxins; premotor syndrome can be caused by various brain lesions; and premenstrual syndrome is not a disease but simply a set of symptoms.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Syndrome"}
