{"title":"The Naked Brothers Band (TV series)","summary":"The Naked Brothers Band is an American musical comedy television series created by Polly Draper, which aired on Nickelodeon from February 3, 2007 to June 13, 2009. It depicts the daily lives of Draper's sons, who lead a faux world-renowned rock band in New York City. As a mockumentary, the storyline is an embellished parody of their real lives, and the fictional presence of a camera is often acknowledged. The show stars Nat Wolff and Alex Wolff, the lead singer-songwriter, and drummer, respectively. Nat's fictional female interest (portrayed by Allie DiMeco) and real-life friends Thomas Batuello, David Levi, and Cooper Pillot, as well as Qaasim Middleton—who has no prior acquaintance with the family—feature as the other band members, with Draper's jazz musician husband Michael Wolff as his sons' widowed accordion-playing dad, and her niece Jesse Draper portraying the group's babysitter.","image":"Naked_Brothers_Band_Logo.PNG.webp"}
