{"title":"Virtual image","summary":"In optics, an image is defined as the collection of focus points of light rays coming from an object. A real image is the collection of focus points made by converging rays, while a virtual image is the collection of focus points made by extensions of diverging rays. In other words, a virtual image is found by tracing real rays that emerge from an optical device (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to perceived or apparent origins of ray divergences. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by dotted lines.","image":"Virtual_image.svg.png.webp","url":"Virtual_image"}
