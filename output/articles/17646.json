{"title":"Generalized linear model","summary":"In statistics, a generalized linear model (GLM) is a flexible generalization of ordinary linear regression. The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value.","image":"Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png.webp","url":"Generalized_linear_model"}
