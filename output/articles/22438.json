{"title":"Irish Wolfhound","summary":"The Irish Wolfhound is a historic sighthound dog breed from Ireland that has, by its presence and substantial size, inspired literature, poetry and mythology.[2][3][4] Like all sighthounds, it was used to pursue game by speed; it was also famed as a guardian dog, specializing in protection against and for the hunting of wolves. The original dog-type was presumed extinct by most knowledgeable authors but recreated specifically for the canine fancy mainly by Captain George A. Graham in the late 19th century.[5][6] The modern breed, classified by recent genetic research into the Sighthound United Kingdom Rural Clade (Fig. S2),[7] has been used by coursing hunters who have prized it for its ability to dispatch game caught by other, swifter sighthounds.[8][9]","image":"(2)_Irish_Wolfhound_4.jpg.webp"}
