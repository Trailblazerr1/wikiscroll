{"title":"Technological convergence","summary":"Technological convergence, also known as digital convergence, is the tendency for technologies that were originally unrelated to become more closely integrated and even unified as they develop and advance. For example, watches, telephones, television, computers, and social media platforms began as separate and mostly unrelated technologies, but have converged in many ways into interrelated parts of a telecommunication and media industry, sharing common elements of digital electronics and software.","image":"Librem5_phone_convergence_-_screen_keyboard_mouse.jpg.webp","url":"Technological_convergence"}
