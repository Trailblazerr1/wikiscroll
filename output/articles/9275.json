{"title":"Charge density","summary":"In electromagnetism, charge density is the amount of electric charge per unit length, surface area, or volume.  Volume charge density (symbolized by the Greek letter ρ) is the quantity of charge per unit volume, measured in the SI system in coulombs per cubic meter (C⋅m−3), at any point in a volume.[1][2][3]  Surface charge density (σ) is the quantity of charge per unit area, measured in coulombs per square meter (C⋅m−2), at any point on a surface charge distribution on a two dimensional surface. Linear charge density (λ) is the quantity of charge per unit  length, measured in coulombs per meter (C⋅m−1), at any point on a line charge distribution.  Charge density can be either positive or negative, since electric charge can be either positive or negative.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp","url":"Charge_density"}
