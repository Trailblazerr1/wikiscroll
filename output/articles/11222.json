{"title":"Cornet","summary":"The cornet (/ˈkɔːrnɪt/,[1] US: /kɔːrˈnɛt/) is a brass instrument similar to the trumpet but distinguished from it by its conical bore, more compact shape, and mellower tone quality.  The most common cornet is a transposing instrument in B♭, though there is also a soprano cornet in E♭ and cornets in A and C. All are unrelated to the Renaissance and early Baroque cornett.","image":"Cornet-Bb-large.jpg.webp"}
