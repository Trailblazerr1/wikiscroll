{"title":"Realism (international relations)","summary":"Realism is one of the dominant schools of thought in international relations theory, theoretically formalising the Realpolitik statesmanship of early modern Europe. Although a highly diverse body of thought, it is unified by the belief that world politics is always and necessarily a field of conflict among actors pursuing wealth and power. The theories of realism are contrasted by the cooperative ideals of liberalism.","image":"Portrait_of_Niccol√≤_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito.jpg.webp","url":"Realism_(international_relations)"}
