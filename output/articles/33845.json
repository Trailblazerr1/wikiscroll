{"title":"Paracetamol poisoning","summary":"Paracetamol poisoning, also known as acetaminophen poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen).[2] Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24Â hours following overdose. These include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed by a couple of days without any symptoms, after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs as a result of liver failure. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]","image":"Paracetamol-skeletal.svg.png.webp"}
