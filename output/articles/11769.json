{"title":"Cy Young Award","summary":"The Cy Young Award is given annually to the best pitchers in Major League Baseball (MLB), one each for the American League (AL) and National League (NL). The award was first introduced in 1956 by Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, but in 1967, after the retirement of Frick, the award was given to one pitcher in each league.[1][2]","image":"Ferguson_Jenkins'_Cy_Young_Award%2C_Canadian_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame%2C_St._Marys_Ontario_2944_(4871384701).jpg.webp"}
