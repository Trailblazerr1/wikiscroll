{"title":"Alveolar consonant","summary":"Alveolar /ælˈviːələr/[1] consonants are articulated with the tongue against or close to the superior alveolar ridge, which is called that because it contains the alveoli (the sockets) of the upper teeth. Alveolar consonants may be articulated with the tip of the tongue (the apical consonants), as in English, or with the flat of the tongue just above the tip (the \"blade\" of the tongue; called laminal consonants), as in French and Spanish.","image":"Xsampa-n.png.webp","url":"Alveolar_consonant"}
