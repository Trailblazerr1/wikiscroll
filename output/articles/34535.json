{"title":"Persistent world","summary":"A persistent world or persistent state world (PSW) is a virtual world which, by the definition by Richard Bartle, \"continues to exist and develop internally even when there are no people interacting with it\".[1] The first virtual worlds were text-based and often called MUDs, but the term is frequently used in relation to massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)[1] and pervasive games.[2] Examples of persistent worlds that exist in video games include Battle Dawn, EVE Online, and Realms of Trinity.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
