{"title":"EA Sports","summary":"EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games.  Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \"EA Sports Network\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as John Madden, it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as FIFA, NHL, NBA Live and Madden NFL.","image":"EA_Sports_monochrome_logo.svg.png.webp"}
