{"title":"Syro-Malabar Church","summary":"The Syro-Malabar  Catholic Church[18] (Syriac:ܥܸܕܬܵܐ ܩܵܬܘܿܠܝܼܩܝܼ ܕܡܲܠܲܒܵܪ ܣܘܼܪܝܵܝܵܐ) is an Eastern Catholic Church and a  Major Archiepiscopal Church based in Kerala, India. The Syro-Malabar Church is an autonomous (in Latin, sui iuris) particular church in full communion with the pope and the worldwide Catholic Church, including the Latin Church and the 22 other Eastern Catholic Churches, with self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO). The Church is headed by the Metropolitan and Gate of all India Major Archbishop Mar George Cardinal Alencherry. The Syro-Malabar Synod of Bishops canonically convoked and presided over by the Major Archbishop constitutes the supreme authority of the Church. The Major Archiepiscopal Curia of the Church is based in Kakkanad, Kochi.[19] Syro-Malabar is a prefix coined from the words Syriac as the church employs the East Syriac Rite liturgy, and Malabar which is the historical name for modern Kerala. The name has been in usage in official Vatican documents since the nineteenth century.[20] It is the second largest Eastern Catholic Church in the Catholic communion, after the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.[21] The Syro-Malabar Church is primarily based in India; with 5 metropolitan archeparchies (archdioceses) and 10 suffragan eparchies in Kerala, there's 17 eparchies in other parts of India, and 4 eparchies outside India.","image":"St._Thomas'_Cross_(Chennai%2C_St._Thomas_Mount).jpg.webp"}
