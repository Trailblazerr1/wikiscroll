{"title":"Glaucoma","summary":"Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases which result in damage to the optic nerve (or retina[5]) and cause vision loss.[1] The most common type is open-angle (wide angle, chronic simple) glaucoma, in which the drainage angle for fluid within the eye remains open, with less common types including closed-angle (narrow angle, acute congestive) glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma.[1] Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly over time and there is no pain.[1] Peripheral vision may begin to decrease, followed by central vision, resulting in blindness if not treated.[1] Closed-angle glaucoma can present gradually or suddenly.[2] The sudden presentation may involve severe eye pain, blurred vision, mid-dilated pupil, redness of the eye, and nausea.[1][2] Vision loss from glaucoma, once it has occurred, is permanent.[1] Eyes affected by glaucoma are referred to as being glaucomatous.","image":"Acute_angle_closure_glaucoma.JPG.webp","url":"Glaucoma"}
