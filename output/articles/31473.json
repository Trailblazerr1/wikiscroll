{"title":"Natural number","summary":"In mathematics, the natural numbers are those numbers used for counting (as in \"there are six coins on the table\") and ordering (as in \"this is the third largest city in the country\"). In common mathematical terminology, words colloquially used for counting are \"cardinal numbers\", and words used for ordering are \"ordinal numbers\". The natural numbers can, at times, appear as a convenient set of codes (labels or \"names\"), that is, as what linguists call nominal numbers, forgoing many or all of the properties of being a number in a mathematical sense.[1][2]","image":"Three_Baskets.svg.png.webp"}
