{"title":"Matroska","summary":"The Matroska Multimedia Container is a free and open container format, a file format that can hold an unlimited number of video, audio, picture, or subtitle tracks in one file.[1] It is a universal format for storing common multimedia content, like movies or TV shows. Matroska is similar in concept to other containers like AVI, MP4, or Advanced Systems Format (ASF), but is entirely open in specification, with implementations consisting mostly of open source software. Matroska file extensions are .mkv for video (which may include subtitles or audio), .mk3d for stereoscopic video, .mka for audio-only files, and .mks for subtitles only.[2]","image":"Matroska_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Matroska"}
