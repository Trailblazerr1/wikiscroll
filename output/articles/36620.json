{"title":"Père David's deer","summary":"The milu deer (Elaphurus davidianus) (Chinese: 麋鹿; pinyin: mílù), also known as the Père David's deer or elaphure, is a species of deer native to the river valleys of China. It grazes mainly on grass and aquatic plants. It is the only extant member of the genus Elaphurus. Based on genetic comparisons, milu deer is closely related to the deer of the genus Cervus, leading many experts to suggest merging Elaphurus into Cervus,[2] or demoting Elaphurus to a subgenus of Cervus.[3]","image":"Pere_David_Deer_-_Woburn_Deer_Park_(5115883164).jpg.webp"}
