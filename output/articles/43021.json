{"title":"Sweetheart of the Rodeo","summary":"Sweetheart of the Rodeo is the sixth album by American rock band the Byrds and was released in August 1968 on Columbia Records.[2] Recorded with the addition of country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, it became the first major album widely recognised as country rock,[3] and represented a stylistic move away from the psychedelic rock of the band's previous LP, The Notorious Byrd Brothers.[4]  The Byrds had occasionally experimented with country music on their four previous albums, but Sweetheart of the Rodeo represented their fullest immersion into the genre thus far.[5][6][7]  The album was also responsible for bringing Parsons, who had joined the Byrds prior to the recording of the album, to the attention of a mainstream rock audience for the first time.[7][8]  Thus, the album can be seen as an important chapter in Parsons' personal and musical crusade to make country music fashionable for a young audience.[9]","image":"TheByrdsSweetheartoftheRodeo.jpg.webp"}
