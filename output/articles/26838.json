{"title":"List of female United States Cabinet members","summary":"The Cabinet of the United States has had 38 woman officers serving as secretaries of one or more of the United States federal executive departments and 29 women as Cabinet-level officials; with three of them appointed at the helm of the different departments, while four served both as Cabinet and Cabinet-rank officeholders. The vice president historically is also part of the presidential cabinet, ready to assume the Presidency should the need arise; one woman was elected to the position. No woman held a Cabinet position before the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, which prohibits states and the federal government from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's sex.[1]","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp"}
