{"title":"City and South London Railway","summary":"The City and South London Railway (C&SLR) was the first deep-level underground \"tube\" railway in the world,[1][note 1] and the first major railway to use electric traction. The railway was originally intended for cable-hauled trains, but owing to the bankruptcy of the cable contractor during construction, a system of electric traction using electric locomotives—an experimental technology at the time—was chosen instead.","image":"Plaque_on_Monument_to_James_Henry_Greathead.jpg.webp","url":"City_and_South_London_Railway"}
