{"title":"Quark model","summary":"In particle physics, the quark model is a classification scheme for hadrons in terms of their valence quarks—the quarks and antiquarks which give rise to the quantum numbers of the hadrons. The quark model  underlies \"flavor SU(3)\", or the Eightfold Way, the successful classification scheme organizing the large number of lighter hadrons that were being discovered starting in the 1950s and continuing through the 1960s. It received experimental verification beginning in the late 1960s and is a valid effective  classification of them to date. The model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann,[1] who dubbed them \"quarks\" in a concise paper, and George Zweig,[2][3] who suggested \"aces\" in a longer manuscript. André Petermann also touched upon the central ideas from 1963 to 1965, without as much quantitative substantiation.[4][5] Today, the model has essentially been absorbed as a component of the established quantum field theory of strong and electroweak particle interactions, dubbed the Standard Model.","image":"8foldway.png.webp"}
