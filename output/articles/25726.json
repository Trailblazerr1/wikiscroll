{"title":"Leaf-nosed bat","summary":"The New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae)[1] are found from southern North America to South America, specifically from the Southwest United States to northern Argentina. They are ecologically the most varied and diverse family within the order Chiroptera. Most species are insectivorous, but the phyllostomid bats include within their number true predatory species and frugivores (subfamily Stenodermatinae and Carolliinae). For example, the spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum), the largest bat in the Americas, eats vertebrate prey, including small, dove-sized birds. Members of this family have evolved to use food groups such as fruit, nectar, pollen, insects, frogs, other bats, and small vertebrates, and in the case of the vampire bats, even blood.","image":"Artibeus_sp._Tortuguero_National_Park_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Leaf-nosed_bat"}
