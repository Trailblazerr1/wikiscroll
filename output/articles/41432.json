{"title":"Soup kitchen","summary":"A soup kitchen, food kitchen, or meal center is a place where food is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at a below-market price (such as via coin donations upon visiting). Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, soup kitchens are often staffed by volunteer organizations, such as church or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a food bank for free or at a low price, because they are considered a charity, which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.","image":"MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg.webp"}
