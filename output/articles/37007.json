{"title":"Railway electrification system","summary":"A railway electrification system supplies electric power to railway trains and trams without an on-board prime mover or local fuel supply.\nElectric railways use either electric locomotives (hauling passengers or freight in separate cars), electric multiple units (passenger cars with their own motors) or both.\nElectricity is typically generated in large and relatively efficient generating stations, transmitted to the railway network and distributed to the trains. Some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and transmission lines, but most purchase power from an electric utility. The railway usually provides its own distribution lines, switches, and transformers.","image":"KCRC_Metro_Cammell_train%2C_1993.JPG.webp"}
