{"title":"Vitrification","summary":"Vitrification (from Latin vitreum, \"glass\" via French vitrifier) is the transformation of a substance into a glass,[1] that is to say, a non-crystalline amorphous solid. Glasses differ from liquids structurally and glasses possess a higher degree of connectivity with the same Hausdorff dimensionality of bonds as crystals: dimH = 3.[2] In the production of ceramics, vitrification is responsible for its impermeability to water.[3]","image":"Vitrification.png.webp","url":"Vitrification"}
