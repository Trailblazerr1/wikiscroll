{"title":"Recorder (musical instrument)","summary":"The recorder is a family of woodwind musical instruments in the group known as internal duct flutesâ€”flutes with a whistle mouthpiece, also known as fipple flutes. A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of a thumb-hole for the upper hand and seven finger-holes: three for the upper hand and four for the lower. It is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition.[1]","image":"VariousRecorderFlutes.jpg.webp","url":"Recorder_(musical_instrument)"}
