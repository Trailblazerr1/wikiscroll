{"title":"Mindfulness","summary":"Mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing one's attention in the present moment without evaluation,[1][2][note 1][3][4] a skill one develops through meditation or other training.[2][5][6] Mindfulness derives from sati, a significant element of Buddhist traditions,[7][8] and is based on Zen, Vipassanā, and Tibetan meditation techniques.[9][10][note 2] Though definitions and techniques of mindfulness are wide-ranging,[16] Buddhist traditions explain what constitutes mindfulness such as how past, present and future moments arise and cease as momentary sense impressions and mental phenomena.[7][17][18] Individuals who have contributed to the popularity of mindfulness in the modern Western context include Thích Nhất Hạnh, Herbert Benson, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Richard J. Davidson,[19][20] and Sam Harris.","image":"Concentrating_Cartoon_Woman_In_Deep_Meditation.svg.png.webp"}
