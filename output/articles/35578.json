{"title":"Pornography in Japan","summary":"Pornography in Japan has unique characteristics that readily distinguish it from western pornography.[1] Pornographic films are known as \"adult videos\" (AV) in Japan, so Japanese adult videos are \"JAV\", referring to the Japanese pornographic film industry. Animated films are referred to as hentai in English, but in Japan the terms \"adult anime\" and \"erotic animation\" (or ero anime) are used.  In addition to pornographic videos and magazines featuring live actors, there are now categories of pornographic manga and anime[lower-alpha 1] (i.e., hentai), and pornographic computer games (eroge; for both PC and game consoles).","image":"Pornographies_of_Japan.jpg.webp"}
