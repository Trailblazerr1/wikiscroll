{"title":"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves","summary":"\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (Arabic: علي بابا والأربعون لصا‎) is a folk tale from the One Thousand and One Nights. It was added to the collection in the 18th century by its French translator Antoine Galland, who heard it from Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab. As one of the most familiar of the Arabian Nights tales, it has been widely retold and performed in many media, especially for children, for whom the more violent aspects of the story are often suppressed.","image":"Cassim.jpg.webp"}
