{"title":"Liverpool F.C. Reserves and Academy","summary":"Liverpool F.C. Reserves is the reserve team of Liverpool. It is the most senior level of the Liverpool academy beneath the first team. In the summer of 2012, the whole English reserve football system was overhauled and replaced with an Under 21 league system, the Professional Development League. Liverpool's Reserve team became the Liverpool under 21 team and competes in the Professional Development League 1 which is also known by its sponsorship name of Barclays under 21 Premier League. The team generally consists of Under-21 players at the club but at times senior players also play for the reserves when they are recuperating from injury. Following the introduction of new regulations from the 2012â€“13 season, only three outfield players and one goalkeeper over the age of 21 can play for the reserves regularly.","image":"Kit_left_arm_liverpool2122H.png.webp"}
