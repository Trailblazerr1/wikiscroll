{"title":"RheinEnergieStadion","summary":"RheinEnergieStadion, formerly Müngersdorfer Stadion or Müngersdorfer Stadium (German pronunciation: [ˌʁaɪnʔenɛʁˈɡiːˌʃtaːdi̯ɔn]), is a German football stadium in Cologne. It was built on the site of the two previous Müngersdorfer stadiums. It is the home of the local Bundesliga team, 1. FC Köln. The stadium was one of five stadiums hosting both the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and 2006 FIFA World Cup, and hosted the 2020 UEFA Europa League Final behind closed doors. Local energy company RheinEnergie AG currently holds the naming rights to the stadium, hence it was known as the Stadion Köln for the final.","image":"RheinEnergieSTADION_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
