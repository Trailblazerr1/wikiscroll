{"title":"Enthalpy of vaporization","summary":"The enthalpy of vaporization (symbol âˆ†Hvap), also known as the (latent) heat of vaporization or heat of evaporation, is the amount of energy (enthalpy) that must be added to a liquid substance to transform a quantity of that substance into a gas. The enthalpy of vaporization is a function of the pressure at which that transformation takes place.","image":"Heat_of_Vaporization_(Benzene%2BAcetone%2BMethanol%2BWater).png.webp"}
