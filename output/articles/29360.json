{"title":"Mercantilism","summary":"Mercantilism is an economic policy that is designed to maximize the exports and minimize the imports for an economy. It promotes monarchy, aristocracy, clericalism, militarism, imperialism, colonialism, tariffs and subsidies on traded goods to achieve that goal. The policy aims to reduce a possible current account deficit or reach a current account surplus, and it includes measures aimed at accumulating monetary reserves by a positive balance of trade, especially of finished goods. Historically, such policies frequently led to war and motivated colonial expansion.[1] Mercantilist theory varies in sophistication from one writer to another and has evolved over time.","image":"F0087_Louvre_Gellee_port_au_soleil_couchant-_INV4715_rwk.jpg.webp","url":"Mercantilism"}
