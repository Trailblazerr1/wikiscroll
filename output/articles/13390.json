{"title":"Don Tallon","summary":"Donald Tallon (17 February 1916 â€“ 7 September 1984) was an Australian cricketer who played 21 Test matches as a wicket-keeper between 1946 and 1953. He was widely regarded by his contemporaries as Australia's finest ever wicket-keeper and one of the best in Test history,[1] with an understated style, an ability to anticipate the flight, length and spin of the ball and an efficient stumping technique.  Tallon toured England as part of Don Bradman's Invincibles of 1948 and was recognised as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 for his performances during that season.   During his Test career, Tallon made 58 dismissals comprising 50 catches and 8 stumpings.","image":"DonTallon.jpg.webp","url":"Don_Tallon"}
