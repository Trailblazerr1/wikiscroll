{"title":"Cricket (insect)","summary":"Crickets are Orthopteran insects which are related to bush crickets, and, more distantly, to grasshoppers. In older literature, such as Imms,[3] \"crickets\" were placed at the family level (i.e. Gryllidae), but contemporary authorities including Otte now place them in the superfamily Grylloidea.[1]  The word has been used in combination to describe more distantly related taxa[3] in the suborder Ensifera, such as king crickets and mole crickets.","image":"Gryllus_campestris_MHNT.jpg.webp","url":"Cricket_(insect)"}
