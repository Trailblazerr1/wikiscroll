{"title":"Bayes' theorem","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, Bayes' theorem (alternatively Bayes' law or Bayes' rule; recently Bayes–Price theorem[1]: 44, 45, 46 and 67 ), named after Thomas Bayes, describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.[2] For example, if the risk of developing health problems is known to increase with age, Bayes' theorem allows the risk to an individual of a known age to be assessed more accurately (by conditioning it on their age) than simply assuming that the individual is typical of the population as a whole.","image":"Bayes'_Theorem_MMB_01.jpg.webp","url":"Bayes'_theorem"}
