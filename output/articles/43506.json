{"title":"Taíno","summary":"The Taíno were an indigenous people of the Caribbean.[2] At the time of European contact in the late fifteenth century, they were the principal inhabitants of most of  what is now Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and the northern Lesser Antilles. The Taíno were the first New World peoples encountered by Christopher Columbus during his 1492 voyage. They spoke the Taíno language, a division of the Arawakan language group.[3] Many Puerto Ricans, Cubans and Dominicans have Taíno mtDNA, showing they are descendants through the direct female lines.[4][5]","image":"Estatua_de_Agüeybaná_II%2C_El_Bravo%2C_en_el_Parque_Monumento_a_Agüeybaná_II%2C_El_Bravo%2C_en_Ponce%2C_Puerto_Rico_(DSC02672C).jpg.webp"}
