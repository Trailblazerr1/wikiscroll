{"title":"Bhāskara II","summary":"Bhāskara (c. 1114–1185) also known as Bhāskarāchārya (\"Bhāskara, the teacher\"), and as Bhāskara II to avoid confusion with Bhāskara I, was an Indian mathematician and astronomer. From verses, in his main work, Siddhanta Shiromani (सिध्दांतशिरोमणी), it can be inferred that he was born in 1114 in Vijjalvid (Vijjadavida) in the Sahyadhri mountain range, near the town of Patan in the Western Ghat region in present-day Khandesh in Maharashtra. He is the only ancient mathematician who has been immortalized on a monument. In a temple in Maharashtra, an inscription supposedly created by his grandson Cangadeva, lists Bhaskaracharya's ancestral lineage for several generations before him as well as two generations after him.[1][2] Colebrooke who was the first European to translate (1817) Bhaskaracharya II's  mathematical classics refers to the family as Maharashtrian Brahmins residing on the banks of the Godavari.[3]","image":"Teorema_de_Pitágoras.Bhaskara.svg.png.webp","url":"Bhāskara_II"}
