{"title":"Mari, Syria","summary":"Mari (Cuneiform: ð’ˆ ð’Œ·ð’† , ma-riki, modern Tell Hariri; Arabic: ØªÙ„ Ø­Ø±ÙŠØ±ÙŠâ€Ž) was an ancient Semitic city-state in modern-day Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located 11Â kilometers north-west of Abu Kamal on the Euphrates river western bank, some 120Â kilometers southeast of Deir ez-Zor. It flourished as a trade center and hegemonic state between 2900Â BC and 1759Â BC.[note 1] As a purposely-built city, the existence of Mari was related to its position in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes; this position made it an intermediary between Sumer in the south and the Eblaite kingdom and the Levant in the west.","image":"MariZiggurat.jpg.webp"}
