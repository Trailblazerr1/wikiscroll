{"title":"Traffic congestion","summary":"Traffic congestion is a condition in transport that is characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. Traffic congestion on urban road networks has increased substantially, since the 1950s.[1]  When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream, this results in some congestion.  While congestion is a possibility for any mode of transportation, this article will focus on automobile congestion on public roads.","image":"Moscow%2C_Garden_Ring%2C_heavy_traffic_entering_Mayakovka_tunnel.jpg.webp","url":"Traffic_congestion"}
