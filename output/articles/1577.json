{"title":"Theistic evolution","summary":"Theistic evolution[lower-alpha 1] is a general term comprising views that regard religious teachings about God as compatible with modern scientific understanding about biological evolution. Theistic evolution is not in itself a scientific theory, but a range of views about how the science of general evolution relates to religious beliefs in contrast to special creation views. Theistic evolutionists accept the scientific consensus on the age of the Earth, the age of the universe, the Big Bang, the origin of the Solar System, the origin of life, and evolution.","image":"Darwin's_finches_by_Gould.jpg.webp"}
