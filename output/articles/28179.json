{"title":"Malic acid","summary":"Malic acid is an organic compound with the molecular formula C4H6O5.  It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive.  Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms (L- and D-enantiomers), though only the L-isomer exists naturally.  The salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates. The malate anion is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle.","image":"Äpfelsäure3.svg.png.webp"}
