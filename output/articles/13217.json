{"title":"Diving reflex","summary":"The diving reflex, also known as the diving response and mammalian diving reflex, is a set of physiological responses to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes, and is found in all air-breathing vertebrates studied to date.[1][2][3] It optimizes respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, enabling submersion for an extended time.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Diving_reflex"}
