{"title":"Total internal reflection","summary":"Total internal reflection (TIR) is the optical phenomenon in which waves arriving at the interface (boundary) from one medium to another (e.g., from water to air) are not refracted into the second (\"external\") medium, but completely reflected back into the first (\"internal\") medium. It occurs when the second medium has a higher wave speed (lower refractive index) than the first, and the waves are incident at a sufficiently oblique angle on the interface. For example, the water-to-air surface in a typical fish tank, when viewed obliquely from below, reflects the underwater scene like a mirror with no loss of brightness (Fig.â€¯1).","image":"Aquarium_total_internal_reflection.jpg.webp","url":"Total_internal_reflection"}
