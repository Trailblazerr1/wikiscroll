{"title":"Crab","summary":"Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting \"tail\" (abdomen) (Greek: βραχύς, romanized: brachys = short,[2] οὐρά / οura = tail[3]), usually hidden entirely under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, and have a single pair of pincers. Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances – such as king crabs and porcelain crabs are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.","image":"Liocarcinus_vernalis.jpg.webp"}
