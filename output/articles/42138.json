{"title":"State park","summary":"State parks are parks or other protected areas managed at the sub-national level within those nations which use \"state\" as a political subdivision. State parks are typically established by a state to preserve a location on account of its natural beauty, historic interest, or recreational potential. There are state parks under the administration of the government of each U.S. state, some of the Mexican states, and in Brazil. The term is also used in the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales.[1] The equivalent term used in Canada, Argentina, South Africa, and Belgium, is provincial park. Similar systems of local government maintained parks exist in other countries, but the terminology varies.","image":"Niagara_Falls_2009.jpg.webp","url":"State_park"}
