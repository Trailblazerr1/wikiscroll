{"title":"Daman and Diu","summary":"Daman and Diu (/dəˈmɑːn ... ˈdiːuː/; locally ; Portuguese: Damão e Dio) is a former union territory in northwestern India. It was a separate union territory until 26 January 2020 before it was merged with Dadra and Nagar Haveli union territory to form a single UT due to its small landmass. With an area of 112 km2 (43 sq mi), it was the smallest administrative subdivision of India on the mainland. The territory comprised two districts, Damaon and Dio island, geographically separated by the Gulf of Cambay. The state of Gujarat and the Arabian Sea bordered the territory. A Portuguese colony since the 1500s, the territories were taken by India with the Annexation of Goa in 1961. Daman and Diu were administered as part of the union territory of Goa, Damaon& Diu between 1961 and 1987, after the Goa Opinion Poll they became a separate union territory. In 2019, legislation was passed to merge the union territory of Daman and Diu with its neighbouring union territory, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, to form the new union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu with effect from 26 January 2020.[1]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
