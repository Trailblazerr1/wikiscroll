{"title":"Giant squid","summary":"The giant squid (Architeuthis dux) is a species of deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae. It can grow to a tremendous size, offering an example of deep-sea gigantism: recent estimates put the maximum size at around 12–13 m (39–43 ft)[2][3][4][5] for females and 10 m (33 ft)[3] for males, from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (longer than the colossal squid at an estimated 9–10 m (30–33 ft),[6] but substantially lighter, due to the tentacles making up most of the length[7]). The mantle of the giant squid is about 2 m (6 ft 7 in) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles (but including head and arms) rarely exceeds 5 m (16 ft).[3] Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.[3]","image":"Architeuthis_princeps_image_modified.PNG.webp"}
