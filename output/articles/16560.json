{"title":"Flying fish","summary":"The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes  class Actinopterygii, known colloquially as flying fish or flying cod. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. While they cannot fly in the same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where their long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface. The main reason for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators,[3][4][5] which include swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others,[6] though their periods of flight expose them to attack by avian predators such as frigate birds.","image":"Sailfin_flyingfish.jpg.webp","url":"Flying_fish"}
