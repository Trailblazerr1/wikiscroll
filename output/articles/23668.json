{"title":"John Flamsteed","summary":"John Flamsteed FRS (19 August 1646 â€“ 31 December 1719) was an English astronomer and the first Astronomer Royal. His main achievements were the preparation of a 3,000-star catalogue, Catalogus Britannicus, and a star atlas called Atlas Coelestis, both published posthumously. He also made the first recorded observations of Uranus, although he mistakenly catalogued it as a star, and he laid the foundation stone for the Royal Greenwich Observatory.","image":"John_Flamsteed_1702.jpg.webp"}
