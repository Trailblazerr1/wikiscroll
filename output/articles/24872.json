{"title":"Kinglet","summary":"A kinglet or crest is a small bird in the family Regulidae. Species in this family were formerly classified with the Old World warblers. \"Regulidae\" is derived from the Latin word regulus for \"petty king\" or prince, and refers to the coloured crowns of adult birds. This family has representatives in North America and Eurasia. There are six species in this family; one, the Madeira firecrest, Regulus madeirensis, was only recently split from common firecrest as a separate species. One species, the ruby-crowned kinglet, differs sufficiently in its voice and plumage to be afforded its own genus, Corthylio.","image":"Regulus_regulus_japonensis_face.JPG.webp"}
