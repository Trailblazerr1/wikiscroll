{"title":"Cauchy's integral theorem","summary":"In mathematics, the Cauchy integral theorem (also known as the Cauchy–Goursat theorem) in complex analysis, named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy (and Édouard Goursat), is an important statement about line integrals for holomorphic functions in the complex plane. Essentially, it says that if \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        z\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(z)}\n  \n is analytic in a simply connected domain Ω, then for any simply closed contour \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n in Ω, that contour integral is zero.","image":"d8dd568d570b390c337c0a911f0a1c5c214e8240.svg"}
