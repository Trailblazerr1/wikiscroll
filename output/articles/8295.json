{"title":"Calvin Coolidge","summary":"Calvin Coolidge[1] (born John Calvin Coolidge Jr.; /ˈkuːlɪdʒ/; July 4, 1872 – January 5, 1933) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 30th president of the United States from 1923 to 1929. A Republican lawyer from New England, born in Vermont, Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of Massachusetts state politics, eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts. His response to the Boston Police Strike of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. The next year, he was elected the 29th vice president of the United States, and he succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of Warren G. Harding in 1923. Elected in his own right in 1924, he gained a reputation as a small-government conservative and also as a man who said very little and had a dry sense of humor, receiving the nickname \"Silent Cal\".[2][3] He chose not to run again in the 1928 election, remarking that ten years as president was (at the time) \"longer than any other man has had it—too long!\"","image":"Calvin_Coolidge_cph.3g10777_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Calvin_Coolidge"}
