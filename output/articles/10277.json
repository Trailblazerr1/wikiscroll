{"title":"Climate of India","summary":"The Climate of India consists of a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scale and varied topography, making generalizations difficult. Based on the KÃ¶ppen system, India hosts six major climatic sub types, ranging from arid deserts in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropical regions supporting rain forests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkly different microclimates, making it one of the most climatically diverse countries in the world. The country's meteorological department follows the international standard of four seasons with some local adjustments: winter (January and February), summer (March, April and May), monsoon (rainy) season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October to December).","image":"Valley_of_flowers_uttaranchal_full_view.JPG.webp","url":"Climate_of_India"}
