{"title":"Sleep apnea","summary":"Sleep apnea, also spelled sleep apnoea, is a sleep disorder in which pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep occur more often than normal.[1] Each pause can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and they happen many times a night.[1] In the most common form, this follows loud snoring.[2] There may be a choking or snorting sound as breathing resumes.[1] Because the disorder disrupts normal sleep, those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day.[1] In children, it may cause hyperactivity or problems in school.[2]","image":"Obstruction_ventilation_apn√©e_sommeil.svg.png.webp","url":"Sleep_apnea"}
