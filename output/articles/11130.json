{"title":"Coordinate covalent bond","summary":"A coordinate covalent bond,[1] also known as a dative bond,[2] dipolar bond,[3] or coordinate bond[4] is a kind of two-center, two-electron covalent bond in which the two electrons derive from the same atom.  The bonding of metal ions to ligands involves this kind of interaction.[5]  This type of interaction is central to Lewis acidâ€“base theory.","image":"NH3-BF3-adduct-bond-lengthening-2D.png.webp"}
