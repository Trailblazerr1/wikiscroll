{"title":"Classical Latin","summary":"Classical Latin is the form of Latin language recognized as a literary standard by writers of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. It was used from 75 BC to the 3rd century AD, when it developed into Late Latin. In some later periods, it was regarded as good or proper Latin, with following versions viewed as debased, degenerate, vulgar, or corrupted. The word Latin is now understood by default to mean \"Classical Latin\"; for example, modern Latin textbooks almost exclusively teach Classical Latin.","image":"Rome_Colosseum_inscription_2.jpg.webp"}
