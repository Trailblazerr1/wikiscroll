{"title":"Kidney stone disease","summary":"Kidney stone disease, also known as nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis, is when a solid piece of material (kidney stone) develops in the urinary tract.[2] Kidney stones typically form in the kidney and leave the body in the urine stream.[2] A small stone may pass without causing symptoms.[2] If a stone grows to more than 5 millimeters (0.2Â in), it can cause blockage of the ureter, resulting in sharp and severe pain in the lower back or abdomen.[2][7] A stone may also result in blood in the urine, vomiting, or painful urination.[2] About half of people who have had a kidney stone will have another within ten years.[8]","image":"Nefrolit.jpg.webp"}
