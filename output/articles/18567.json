{"title":"Government agency","summary":"A government or state agency, sometimes an appointed commission, is a permanent or semi-permanent organization in the machinery of government that is responsible for the oversight and administration of specific functions, such as an administration. There is a notable variety of agency types. Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a department or ministry, and other types of public body established by government. The functions of an agency are normally executive in character since different types of organizations (such as commissions) are most often constituted in an advisory roleâ€”this distinction is often blurred in practice however, it is not allowed.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
