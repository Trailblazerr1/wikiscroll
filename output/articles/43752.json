{"title":"Terry-Thomas","summary":"Terry-Thomas (born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens; 10 July 1911 – 8 January 1990)[lower-alpha 1] was an English comedian and character actor who became internationally known through his films during the 1950s and 1960s. He often portrayed disreputable members of the upper classes, especially cads, toffs and bounders, using his distinctive voice; his costume and props tended to include a monocle, waistcoat and cigarette holder. His striking dress sense was set off by a 1⁄3-inch (8.5 mm) gap between his two upper front teeth.","image":"Terry-Thomas_in_Where_Were_You_When_the_Lights_Went_Out.jpg.webp"}
