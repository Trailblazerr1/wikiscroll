He has composed 21 musicals, a song cycle, a set of variations, two film scores, and a Latin Requiem Mass. Several of his songs have been widely recorded and were successful outside of their parent musicals, such as \"Memory\" from Cats, \"The Music of the Night\" and \"All I Ask of You\" from The Phantom of the Opera, \"I Don't Know How to Love Him\" from Jesus Christ Superstar, \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" from Evita, and \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. In 2001, The New York Times referred him as \"the most commercially successful composer in history\".[4] The Daily Telegraph ranked him the \"fifth most powerful person in British culture\" in 2008, with lyricist Don Black writing \"Andrew more or less single-handedly reinvented the musical.\"[5]","image":"2008-11-15_Эндрю_Ллойд_Уэббер.jpeg.webp","url":"Andrew_Lloyd_Webber"}
