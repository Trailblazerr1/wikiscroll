{"title":"Climate sensitivity","summary":"Climate sensitivity is a measure of how much the Earth's climate will cool or warm after a change in the climate system, such as how much it will warm for doubling in carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations.[1] In technical terms, climate sensitivity is the average change in the Earth's surface temperature in response to changes in radiative forcing, which is the difference between incoming and outgoing energy on Earth.[2] Climate sensitivity is a key measure in climate science,[3] and a focus area for climate scientists, who want to understand the ultimate consequences of anthroprogenic global warming.","image":"CS_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
