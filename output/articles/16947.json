{"title":"Frederick Douglass","summary":"Frederick Douglass (born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, c. February 1817[lower-alpha 1] – February 20, 1895) was an American social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman. After escaping from slavery in Maryland, he became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, becoming famous for his oratory[5] and incisive antislavery writings. Accordingly, he was described by abolitionists in his time as a living counterexample to slaveholders' arguments that slaves lacked the intellectual capacity to function as independent American citizens.[6][7] Likewise, Northerners at the time found it hard to believe that such a great orator had once been a slave.[8]","image":"Frederick_Douglass_(circa_1879).jpg.webp","url":"Frederick_Douglass"}
