{"title":"Crispus Attucks","summary":"Crispus Attucks (c.1723 – March 5, 1770) was an American whaler, sailor, and stevedore of African and Native American descent, generally regarded as the first person killed in the Boston Massacre and thus the first American killed in the American Revolution. Historians disagree on whether he was a free man or an escaped slave, but most agree that he was of Native American (specifically Wampanoag) and African descent.[2][3] Two major sources of eyewitness testimony about the Boston Massacre published in 1770 did not refer to him as \"black\" nor as a \"Negro\"; it appears that Bostonians viewed him as being of mixed ethnicity. According to a contemporaneous account in the Pennsylvania Gazette, he was a \"Mulattoe man, named Crispus Attucks, who was born in Framingham, but lately belonged to New Providence, and was here in order to go for North Carolina.\"[4]","image":"lossy-page1-220px-\"Crispus_Attucks%2C\"_by_Herschel_Levit%2C_mural_at_the_Recorder_of_Deeds_building%2C_built_in_1943._515_D_St.%2C_NW%2C_Washington%2C_D.C_LCCN2010641712.tif.jpg.webp","url":"Crispus_Attucks"}
