{"title":"Shetland Sheepdog","summary":"The Shetland Sheepdog, often known as the Sheltie, is a breed of herding dog that originated in the Shetland Islands of Scotland. The original name was Shetland Collie, but this caused controversy amongst Rough Collie breeders of the time, so the breed's name was formally changed.[2] This diligent small dog is clever, vocal, excitable and willing to please. They are incredibly trustworthy to their owners to the point where they are often referred to as \"shadows\" due to their attachment to family. This breed was formally recognized by The Kennel Club (UK) in 1909.","image":"Shetland_Sheepdog_600.jpg.webp","url":"Shetland_Sheepdog"}
