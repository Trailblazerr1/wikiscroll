{"title":"Abdul Ghaffar Khan","summary":"Abdul Ghaffār Khān (Pashto: عبدالغفار خان‎; 6 February 1890 – 20 January 1988), also known as Bādshāh Khān (بادشاه خان‎, 'King Khan'), Frontier/Simant Gandhi or Bāchā Khān (باچا خان‎, 'King of Chiefs') and honourably addressed as Fakhr-e-Afghan (فخرِ افغان‎, 'Pride of Afghans'), was a Pashtun[3] independence activist against British colonial rule in India. He was a political and spiritual leader known for his nonviolent opposition and lifelong pacifism; he was a devout Muslim and an advocate for Hindu−Muslim unity in the Indian subcontinent.[4] Due to his similar ideologies and close friendship with Mahatma Gandhi, Khan was nicknamed Sarhadi Gandhi (Hindi: सरहदी गांधी, lit. 'Frontier Gandhi') by his close associate Amir Chand Bombwal.[5][6] In 1929, Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar, an anti-colonial nonviolent resistance movement. The Khudai Khidmatgar's success and popularity with the Indian people eventually prompted the colonial government to launch numerous crackdowns against Khan and his supporters; the Khudai Khidmatgar experienced some of the most severe repression of the entire Indian independence movement.[7]","image":"Khan_Abdul_Ghaffar_Khan.jpg.webp"}
