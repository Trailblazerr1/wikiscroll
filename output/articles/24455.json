{"title":"Kate Millett","summary":"Katherine Murray Millett (September 14, 1934 â€“ September 6, 2017), better known as Kate Millett, was an American feminist writer, educator, artist, and activist. She attended Oxford University and was the first American woman to be awarded a degree with first-class honors after studying at St Hilda's College, Oxford. She has been described as \"a seminal influence on second-wave feminism\", and is best known for her book Sexual Politics (1970),[1] which was based on her doctoral dissertation at Columbia University. Journalist Liza Featherstone attributes the attainment of previously unimaginable \"legal abortion, greater professional equality between the sexes, and a sexual freedom\" in part to Millett's efforts.[2]","image":"Kate_millet_1.jpg.webp","url":"Kate_Millett"}
