{"title":"The Bus Uncle","summary":"The Bus Uncle is a Cantonese YouTube viral video clip of a quarrel between two men aboard a bus in Hong Kong on 27 April 2006. While the older man, who came to be nicknamed the Bus Uncle, scolded the man seated behind him, a nearby passenger used a camera phone to record the entire incident. The resulting six-minute video[1] was uploaded to the Hong Kong Golden Forum, YouTube, and Google Video. The clip became YouTube's most viewed video in May 2006,[2] attracting viewers with its rhetorical outbursts and copious use of profanity by the older man, receiving 1.7Â million hits in the first 3 weeks of that month.[3]","image":"Route_68X.jpg.webp"}
