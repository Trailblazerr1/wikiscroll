{"title":"Pelagic zone","summary":"The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be further divided into regions by depth, as illustrated on the right. The word \"pelagic\" is derived from Ancient Greek  πέλαγος (pélagos) 'open sea'.[1] The pelagic zone can be thought of in terms of an imaginary cylinder or water column that goes from the surface of the sea almost to the bottom. Conditions in the water column change with depth: the pressure increases; the temperature and amount of light decrease; the salinity and amount of dissolved oxygen (as well as micronutrients such as iron, magnesium and calcium) all change.","image":"Pelagiczone.svg.png.webp","url":"Pelagic_zone"}
