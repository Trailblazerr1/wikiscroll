{"title":"Phillips curve","summary":"The Phillips curve is a single-equation economic model, named after William\nPhillips, hypothesizing an inverse relationship between rates of unemployment and corresponding rates of rises in wages that result within an economy. Stated simply, decreased unemployment, (i.e., increased levels of employment) in an economy will correlate with higher rates of wage rises.[1] Phillips did not himself state there was any relationship between employment and inflation; this notion was a trivial deduction from his statistical findings. Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow made the connection explicit and subsequently Milton Friedman[2] \nand Edmund Phelps[3][4]\nput the theoretical structure in place. In so doing, Friedman was to successfully predict the imminent collapse of Phillips' a-theoretic correlation.","image":"Bank_of_England_Facade.jpg.webp"}
