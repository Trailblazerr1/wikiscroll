{"title":"Anglo-Indian","summary":"Anglo-Indian is a term used to describe two different groups of people: those with mixed Indian and British ancestry, and people of British descent born or residing in India. The latter sense is now mainly historical,[5][6] but confusions can arise. The Oxford English Dictionary, for example, gives three possibilities: \"Of mixed British and Indian parentage, of Indian descent but born or living in Britain or (chiefly historical) of English descent or birth but living or having lived long in India\".[7] People fitting the middle definition are more usually known as British Asian or British Indian. This article focuses primarily on the modern definition, a distinct minority community of mixed Eurasian ancestry, whose first language is English.","image":"Mother_and_daughter_in_India_1920.jpg.webp","url":"Anglo-Indian"}
