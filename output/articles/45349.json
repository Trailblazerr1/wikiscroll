{"title":"Toilets in Japan","summary":"Some toilets in Japan are more elaborate than toilets commonly found in other developed nations. European countries often have a toilet and a bidet separate whilst Japan combines an electronic bidet with the toilet. The current state of the art for Western-style toilets in Japan is the bidet toilet, which, as of March 2016, is installed in 81% of Japanese households.[1] In Japan, these bidets are commonly called washlets, a brand name of Toto Ltd., and include many advanced features rarely seen outside of Asia. The feature set commonly found on washlets are anal hygiene, bidet washing, seat warming, and deodorization. Japanese toilets are well known in popular culture and often parodied in comedic works set in Japan.","image":"JapaneseToiletBidet.jpg.webp"}
