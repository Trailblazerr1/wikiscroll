{"title":"Colorado-class battleship","summary":"The Colorado-class battleships[lower-alpha 1] were a group of four United States Navy super-dreadnoughts, the last of its pre-Treaty battleships. Designed during World War I, their construction overlapped the end of that conflict and continued in its immediate aftermath. Though all four keels were laid, only three ships were launched: Colorado, Maryland, and West Virginia. Washington was over 75% completed when she was canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922. As such, the 16\" gun Colorado-class ships were the last and most powerful battleships built by the U.S. Navy until the  North Carolina class entered service on the eve of World War II.","image":"USS_Colorado_(BB-45)_New_York_1932.jpg.webp","url":"Colorado-class_battleship"}
