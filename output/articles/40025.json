{"title":"Sensory nervous system","summary":"The sensory nervous system is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory  information.  A sensory system consists of sensory neurons (including the sensory receptor cells), neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception.  Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell, and balance.  In short, senses are transducers from the physical world to the realm of the mind where we interpret the information, creating our perception of the world around us.[1]","image":"Gray722.svg.png.webp"}
