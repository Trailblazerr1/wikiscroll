{"title":"Karma in Jainism","summary":"Karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology in Jainism. Human moral actions form the basis of the transmigration of the soul (jīva). The soul is constrained to a cycle of rebirth, trapped within the temporal world (saṃsāra), until it finally achieves liberation (mokṣa). Liberation is achieved by following a path of purification.[1]","image":"Types_of_Karma.JPG.webp","url":"Karma_in_Jainism"}
