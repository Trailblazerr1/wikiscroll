{"title":"Sporangium","summary":"A sporangium (pl. sporangia;[2] from Late Latin, from Ancient Greek  σπορά (sporá) 'seed', and  ἀγγεῖον (angeîon) 'vessel') is an enclosure in which spores are formed.[3] It can be composed of a single cell or can be multicellular. All plants, fungi, and many other lineages form sporangia at some point in their life cycle. Sporangia can produce spores by mitosis, but in nearly all land plants and many fungi, sporangia are the site of meiosis and produce genetically distinct haploid spores.sporangia (singular-sporangium)","image":"Mature_sporangium_of_a_Mucor_sp._fungus.jpg.webp","url":"Sporangium"}
