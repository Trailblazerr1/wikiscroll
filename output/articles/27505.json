{"title":"Lover (album)","summary":"Lover is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 23, 2019, via Republic Records. It is Swift's first album after parting ways with her former label, Big Machine Records. Motivated by her positive experience on her Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), Swift sought to make an album with bright and lighter tones focusing on the foundational strengths of her songcraft, recalibrating from the dark trope of its predecessor, Reputation (2017).","image":"Taylor_Swift_-_Lover.png.webp","url":"Lover_(album)"}
