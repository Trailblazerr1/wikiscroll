{"title":"CD player","summary":"A CD player is an electronic device that plays audio compact discs, which are a digital optical disc data storage format. CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or audiobooks. CD players may be part of home stereo systems, car audio systems, personal computers, or portable CD players such as CD boomboxes. Most CD players produce an output signal via a headphone jack or RCA jacks. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a hi-fi (or other amplifier) and loudspeakers for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack.","image":"Panasonic_SL-S250C_with_Philips_LC0305_20110106.jpg.webp"}
