{"title":"Nitrogen narcosis","summary":"Narcosis while diving (also known as nitrogen narcosis, inert gas narcosis, raptures of the deep, Martini effect) is a reversible alteration in consciousness that occurs while diving at depth. It is caused by the anesthetic effect of certain gases at high pressure. The Greek word νάρκωσις (narkōsis), \"the act of making numb\", is derived from νάρκη (narkē), \"numbness, torpor\", a term used by Homer and Hippocrates.[1] Narcosis produces a state similar to drunkenness (alcohol intoxication), or nitrous oxide inhalation. It can occur during shallow dives, but does not usually become noticeable at depths less than  30 meters (100 ft).","image":"Trimix_label.png.webp"}
