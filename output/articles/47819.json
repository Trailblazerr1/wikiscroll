{"title":"Wahhabism","summary":"Wahhabism (Arabic: الوهابية‎, romanized: al-Wahhābiyyah, lit. 'Wahhabism') is a term used to refer to the Islamic revivalist and fundamentalist movement within Sunni Islam which is associated with the Hanbali reformist doctrines of the Arabian scholar Muhammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhab (1703-1792).[lower-alpha 1][1][2][3][4] It has been variously described as \"orthodox\",[5] \"puritan(ical)\";[6][7] and as an Islamic \"reform movement\" to restore \"pure monotheistic worship\" by devotees.[8][9] The term \"Wahhabism\" was not used by Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab himself, but it is chiefly used by outsiders polemically as an exonym and adherents reject its use, preferring to be called \"Salafi\" (a term used by followers of other Islamic reform movements as well),[7][10] and view themselves as Muwahhid (meaning \"monotheistic\"),[11][12][13] to emphasize the principle of Tawhid[14] (oneness of God).[15] The term has also been described as a Sunniphobic slur.[16][17][18][19] It adheres to the Athari theology.","image":"Sab'u_Masajid.jpg.webp","url":"Wahhabism"}
