{"title":"Comma-separated values","summary":"A comma-separated values (CSV) file is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format. A CSV file typically stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text, in which case each line will have the same number of fields.","image":"CsvDelimited001.svg.png.webp","url":"Comma-separated_values"}
