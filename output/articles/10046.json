{"title":"Circassian genocide","summary":"The Circassian genocide[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] (Adyghe: Адыгэ лъэпкъгъэкӏод, romanized: Adıgə tləpqğək'od; Kabardian: Адыгэ лъэпкъгъэкIуэд, romanized: Adıgə tləpqğək'wəd), known as the Tsitsekun (Цыцэкун, lit. 'The massacre') by the Circassians, was the Russian Empire's systematic mass murder, ethnic cleansing, and expulsion of 800,000–1,500,000 Muslim Circassians[6] (minimum 80–97% of the total population) from their homeland Circassia in the aftermath of the Russo-Circassian War (1763–1864).[1][11] The majority of Circassians were killed or exiled, though a minority resettled in swamps; others who accepted Russification remained. It has been reported that during the events, the Russian-Cossack forces used various methods, such as tearing the bellies of pregnant women.[1][12] Russian generals such as Grigory Zass described the Circassians as \"subhuman filth\", and justified their killing and use in scientific experiments,[13] allowing Russian soldiers to rape Circassian children and women.[upper-roman 1]","image":"Pyotr_Nikolayevich_Gruzinsky_-_The_mountaineers_leave_the_aul.jpg.webp","url":"Circassian_genocide"}
