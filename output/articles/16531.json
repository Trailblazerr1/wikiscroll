{"title":"Fluid dynamics","summary":"In physics and engineering, fluid dynamics  is a subdiscipline of fluid mechanics that describes the flow of fluidsâ€”liquids and gases.  It has several subdisciplines, including aerodynamics (the study of air and other gases in motion) and hydrodynamics (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting weather patterns, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission weapon detonation.","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg","url":"Fluid_dynamics"}
