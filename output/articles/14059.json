{"title":"Eastertide","summary":"Eastertide (also known as Eastertime or the Easter season) or Paschaltide (also known as Paschaltime or the Paschal season) is a festal season in the liturgical year of Christianity that focuses on celebrating the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. It begins on Easter Sunday, which initiates Easter Week in Western Christianity, and Bright Week in Eastern Christianity.[3] There are several Eastertide customs across the Christian world, including sunrise services, exclaiming the Paschal greeting, clipping the church,[4] and decorating Easter eggs, a symbol of the empty tomb.[1][5][6] The Easter lily, a symbol of the resurrection,[2][7] traditionally serve as the chancel flowers that decorate the chancel area of churches throughout Eastertide.[8] Other Eastertide customs include egg hunting, eating special Easter foods and watching Easter parades.[9][10]","image":"Уваскрэсенне_–_Сыходжанне_ў_пекла._Канец_XVII_ст._З_Дзісны_Віцебскай_вобл._Нацыянальны_мастацкі_музей.jpg.webp"}
