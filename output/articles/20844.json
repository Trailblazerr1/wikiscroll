{"title":"Hot rod","summary":"Hot rods are typically old, classic, or modern American cars that have been rebuilt or modified with large engines modified for more speed and acceleration.[2] One definition is: \"a car that's been stripped down, souped up and made to go much faster.\"[3] However, there is no definition of the term that is universally accepted and the term is attached to a wide range of vehicles.[4] Most often they are individually designed and constructed using components from many makes of old or new cars, and are most prevalent in the United States and Canada.[4] Many are intended for exhibition rather than for racing or everyday driving.[4]","image":"ThreeWindowCoupeHotrod6791.jpg.webp"}
