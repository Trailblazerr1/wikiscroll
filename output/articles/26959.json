{"title":"List of premiers of New Brunswick","summary":"The Canadian province of New Brunswick was a British crown colony before it joined Canada in 1867.[1] It had a system of responsible government beginning in 1854, and has kept its own legislature to deal with provincial matters.[2] New Brunswick has a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that has the confidence of the Legislative Assembly to form a government. The premier is New Brunswick's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of New Brunswick, and presides over that body.[3]","image":"CharlesFisher23.jpg.webp"}
