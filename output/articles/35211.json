A year after the studio was founded, video game publisher Sega announced that it would be publishing four unique properties developed by the company: MadWorld, Infinite Space, Bayonetta, and Vanquish. Their partnership later extended to include Anarchy Reigns. Most of these games were met with positive reception. Over the years, PlatinumGames had developed an expertise in action games and one of their key philosophies was that the team would not follow conventional game design concepts.","image":"PlatinumGames_Inc..png.webp"}
