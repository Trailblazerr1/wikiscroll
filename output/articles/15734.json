{"title":"False killer whale","summary":"The false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens) is a species of oceanic dolphin that is the only extant representative of the genus Pseudorca. It is found in oceans worldwide but mainly frequents tropical regions. It was first described in 1846 as a species of porpoise based on a skull, which was revised when the first carcasses were observed in 1861. The name \"false killer whale\" comes from the similar skull characteristics to the killer whale (Orcinus orca).","image":"False_killer_whale_890002.jpg.webp"}
