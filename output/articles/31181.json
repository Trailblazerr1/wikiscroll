{"title":"Naive Bayes classifier","summary":"In statistics, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple \"probabilistic classifiers\" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (na√Øve) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models,[1] but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve higher accuracy levels.[2][3]","image":"Bayes_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Naive_Bayes_classifier"}
