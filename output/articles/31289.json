{"title":"Nashville sit-ins","summary":"The Nashville sit-ins, which lasted from February 13 to May 10, 1960, were part of a nonviolent civil resistance and direct action campaign to end racial segregation at lunch counters in downtown Nashville, Tennessee. The sit-in campaign, coordinated by the Nashville Student Movement and the Nashville Christian Leadership Council, was notable for its early success and its emphasis on disciplined nonviolence. It was part of a broader sit-in movement that spread across the southern United States in the wake of the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina.[1]","image":"Rodney_Powell_Nashville_sit-ins_1960.jpg.webp","url":"Nashville_sit-ins"}
