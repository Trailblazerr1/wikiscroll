{"title":"Aryl hydrocarbon receptor","summary":"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR or AHR or ahr or ahR) or dioxin receptor is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AHR gene. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression. It was originally thought to function primarily as a sensor of xenobiotic chemicals and also as the regulator of enzymes such as cytochrome P450s that metabolize these chemicals.  The most notable of these xenobiotic chemicals are aromatic (aryl) hydrocarbons from which the receptor derives its name.","image":"Ideogram_human_chromosome_7.svg.png.webp","url":"Aryl_hydrocarbon_receptor"}
