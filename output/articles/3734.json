{"title":"Animal coloration","summary":"Animal coloration is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.","image":"Orientalischer_Süßlippfisch.jpg.webp"}
