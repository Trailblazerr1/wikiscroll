{"title":"N-terminus","summary":"The N-terminus (also known as the amino-terminus, NH2-terminus, N-terminal end or amine-terminus) is the start of a protein or polypeptide referring to the free amine group (-NH2) located at the end of a polypeptide. Within a peptide, the amine group is bonded to the carboxylic group of another amino acid making it a chain.  That leaves a free carboxylic group at one end of the peptide called the C-terminus, and a free amine group on the other end called N-terminus. By convention, peptide sequences are written N-terminus to C-terminus, left to right (in LTR writing systems).[1] This correlates the translation direction to the text direction (because when a protein is translated from messenger RNA, it is created from N-terminus to C-terminus - amino acids are added to the carboxyl end).","image":"Tetrapeptide_structural_formulae_v.1.png.webp","url":"N-terminus"}
