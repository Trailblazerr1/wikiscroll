{"title":"Early modern France","summary":"The Kingdom of France (French: Royaume de France) in the early modern period, from the Renaissance (circa 1500–1550) to the Revolution (1789–1804), was a monarchy ruled by the House of Bourbon (a Capetian cadet branch). This corresponds to the so-called Ancien Régime (\"old rule\"). The territory of France during this period increased until it included essentially the extent of the modern country, and it also included the territories of the first French colonial empire overseas.","image":"Pavillon_royal_de_la_France.svg.png.webp","url":"Early_modern_France"}
