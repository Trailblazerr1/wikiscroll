{"title":"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus","summary":"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (until 2014 known as Lactobacillus bulgaricus) is one of over 200 published species in the Lactobacillus genome complex (LGC)[1] and is the main bacterium used for the production of yogurt. It also plays a crucial role in the ripening of some cheeses,[2] as well as in other processes involving naturally fermented products. It is defined as homofermentive lactic acid bacteria due to lactic acid being the single end product of its carbohydrate digestion. It is also considered a probiotic.[3]","image":"20101210_014809_LactobacillusBulgaricus.jpg.webp","url":"Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus"}
