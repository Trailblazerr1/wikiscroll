{"title":"Corinthian order","summary":"The Corinthian order (Greek Κορινθιακός ρυθμός, Latin Ordo Corinthius) is the last developed of the three principal classical orders of Ancient Greek architecture and Roman architecture. The other two are the Doric order which was the earliest, followed by the Ionic order.  In Ancient Greek architecture, the Corinthian order follows the Ionic in almost all respects other than the capitals of the columns.  When classical architecture was revived during the Renaissance, two more orders were added to the canon: the Tuscan order and the Composite order. The Corinthian, with its offshoot the Composite, is the most ornate of the orders. This architectural style is characterized by slender fluted columns and elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves and scrolls. There are many variations.[1]","image":"The_Pantheon%2C_Rome_(14995115321).jpg.webp"}
