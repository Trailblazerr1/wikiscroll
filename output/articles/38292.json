{"title":"Rockism and poptimism","summary":"Rockism (a term used similarly as \"racism\"[2]) is the belief that rock music is dependent on values such as authenticity and artfulness, and that such values elevate the genre over other forms of popular music.[3] So-called \"rockists\" may promote the artifices stereotyped in rock music[4][3] or may regard the genre as the normative state of popular music.[5] Poptimism (or popism[1]) is the belief that pop music is as worthy of professional critique and interest as rock music.[6] Detractors of poptimism describe it as a counterpart of rockism that unfairly privileges the most famous or best-selling pop, hip hop, and R&B acts.[7][8]","image":"Pete_Wylie.jpg.webp","url":"Rockism_and_poptimism"}
