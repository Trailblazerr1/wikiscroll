{"title":"Scout Promise","summary":"Since the publication of Scouting for Boys in 1908, all Scouts and Girl Guides around the world have taken a Scout (or Guide) promise or oath to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribed to a Scout Law. The wording of the Scout Promise (or Oath) and Scout Law have varied slightly over time and from country to country. Some national organization promises are given below. Although most Scouting and Guiding organizations use the word \"promise\", a few such as the Boy Scouts of America tend to use \"oath\" instead. Typically, Scouts and Guides will make the three-fingered Scout Sign when reciting the promise.","image":"Großfahrt_des_Pfadfinderstammes_Ägypten_entlang_der_Theiß%2C_1992_-_Versprechensfeier_am_St._Georgsberg.png.webp"}
