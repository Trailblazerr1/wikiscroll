{"title":"System call","summary":"In computing, a system call (commonly abbreviated to syscall) is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system on which it is executed. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive or accessing the device's camera), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.  System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.","image":"Linux_kernel_interfaces.svg.png.webp","url":"System_call"}
