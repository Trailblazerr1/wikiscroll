{"title":"Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)","summary":"In physics, absorption of electromagnetic radiation is how matter (typically electrons bound in atoms) takes up a photon's energy â€” and so transforms electromagnetic energy into internal energy of the absorber (for example, thermal energy).[1] A notable effect is attenuation, or the gradual reduction of the intensity of light waves as they propagate through a medium. Although the absorption of waves does not usually depend on their intensity (linear absorption), in certain conditions (optics) the medium's transparency changes by a factor that varies as a function of wave intensity, and saturable absorption (or nonlinear absorption) occurs.","image":"Spectroscopy_overview.svg.png.webp","url":"Absorption_(electromagnetic_radiation)"}
