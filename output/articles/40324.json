{"title":"Shawarma","summary":"Shawarma (/ʃəˈwɑːrmə/; Arabic: شاورما‎) is a popular Levantine Arab[4] dish consisting of meat cut into thin slices, stacked in a cone-like shape, and roasted on a slowly-turning vertical rotisserie or spit. Originally made with lamb, mutton or chicken, today's shawarma may also be turkey, beef, or veal.[5][6][1] Thin slices are shaved off the cooked surface as it continuously rotates.[7][8] Shawarma is one of the world's most popular street foods, especially in Egypt, the countries of the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and the rest of the Middle East.[9][10]","image":"Shawarma_stand_in_central_Aleppo%2C_Syria.jpg.webp","url":"Shawarma"}
