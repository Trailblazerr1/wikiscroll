{"title":"Electromagnetic wave equation","summary":"The electromagnetic wave equation is a second-order partial differential equation that describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves through a medium or in a vacuum.  It is a three-dimensional form of the wave equation. The homogeneous form of the equation, written in terms of either the electric field E or the magnetic field B, takes the form:","image":"9259e0f2044b5ce7666462c4d4140519444f22e5.svg","url":"Electromagnetic_wave_equation"}
