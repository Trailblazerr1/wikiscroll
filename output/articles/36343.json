{"title":"Protostome","summary":"Protostomia /proʊtoʊˈstoʊmiə/ is the clade of animals once thought to be characterized by the formation of the organism's mouth before its anus during embryonic development. This nature has since been discovered to be extremely variable among Protostomia's members, although the reverse is typically true of its sister clade, Deuterostomia.[1][2] Some examples of protostomes are nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs.","image":"Protostomia.jpg.webp","url":"Protostome"}
