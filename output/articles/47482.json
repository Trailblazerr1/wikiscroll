{"title":"Vipera ammodytes","summary":"Vipera ammodytes (other common names include horned viper, long-nosed viper, nose-horned viper, sand viper)[3] is a viper species found in southern Europe, mainly the Balkans, and parts of the Middle East. It is reputed to be the most dangerous of the European vipers due to its large size, long fangs (up to 13Â mm) and high venom toxicity.[4] The specific name, ammodytes, is derived from the Greek words ammos, meaning \"sand\", and dutes, meaning \"burrower\" or \"diver\", despite its preference for rocky habitats.[5] Five subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.[6]","image":"Vipera-ammodytes-ruffoi-weiblich.jpg.webp","url":"Vipera_ammodytes"}
