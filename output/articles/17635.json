{"title":"General anaesthesia","summary":"General anaesthesia or general anesthesia (see spelling differences) is a medically induced coma with loss of protective reflexes, resulting from the administration of one or more general anaesthetic agents. It is generally performed in an operating theater to allow surgical procedures that would otherwise be intolerably painful for the patient, or in an intensive care unit or emergency department to facilitate mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients.","image":"Ana_arbeitsplatz.JPG.webp","url":"General_anaesthesia"}
