{"title":"Latin Americans","summary":"Latin Americans (Spanish: Latinoamericanos; Portuguese: Latino-americanos; French: Latino-am√©ricains) are the citizens of Latin American countries (or people with cultural, ancestral or national origins in Latin America). Latin American countries and their diasporas are multi-ethnic and multi-racial, Latin Americans are a pan-ethnicity consisting of people of different ethnic and national backgrounds. As a result, some Latin Americans do not take their nationality as an ethnicity, but identify themselves with a combination of their nationality, ethnicity and their ancestral origins.[18] Aside from the indigenous Amerindian population, all Latin Americans have some ancestors who immigrated since 1492. Latin America has the largest diasporas of Spaniards, Portuguese, Black Africans, Italians, Lebanese and Japanese in the world.[19][20][21] The region also has large German (second largest after the United States),[22] French and Jewish diasporas.","image":"Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png.webp"}
