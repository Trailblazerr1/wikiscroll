{"title":"Buprenorphine","summary":"Buprenorphine is an opioid used to treat opioid use disorder, acute pain, and chronic pain.[8] It can be used under the tongue (sublingual), in the cheek (buccal), by injection (intravenous and subcutaneous), as a skin patch (transdermal), or as an implant.[8][9] For opioid use disorder, it is typically started when withdrawal symptoms have begun and for the first two days of treatment under direct observation of a health-care provider.[8] The combination formulation of buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) is recommended to discourage misuse by injection.[8] Maximum pain relief is generally within an hour with effects up to 24 hours.[8]","image":"Buprenorphine.svg.png.webp"}
