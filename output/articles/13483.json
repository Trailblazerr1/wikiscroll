{"title":"Double-headed eagle","summary":"In heraldry and vexillology, the double-headed eagle (or double-eagle) is a charge associated with the concept of Empire. Most modern uses of the symbol are directly or indirectly associated with its use by the Byzantine Empire, whose use of it represented the Empire's dominion over the Near East and the West. The symbol is much older, and its original meaning is debated among scholars. The eagle has long been a symbol of power and dominion.","image":"Byzantine_eagle_-_emblem_of_the_Ecumenical_Patriarchate_of_Constantinople%2C_entrance_of_the_St._George's_Cathedral%2C_Istanbul.jpg.webp","url":"Double-headed_eagle"}
