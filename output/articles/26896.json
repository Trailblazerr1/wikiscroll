{"title":"List of men's major championships winning golfers","summary":"The men's major golf championships, also known simply as the majors, are the four most prestigious events in professional golf.[1] The competitions are the Masters Tournament, the U.S. Open, The Open Championship and the PGA Championship, contested annually. Should the same golfer win all four majors in a single calendar year, this would be recognized as a grand slam. No one has ever achieved this. Tiger Woods is the only player to have consecutively won all four majors, accomplishing that sequence of victories in the 2000â€“2001 seasons.","image":"Jack_Nicklaus_Congressional_Gold_Medal_(front).jpg.webp"}
