{"title":"They Don't Care About Us","summary":"\"They Don't Care About Us\" is the fifth single from Michael Jackson's album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, and was released in April 16, 1996. It is a protest song and remains one of the most controversial pieces Jackson ever composed. In the US, media scrutiny surrounding  allegations of antisemitic lyrics were the catalyst for Jackson issuing multiple clarifications, an apology, defense from director Spike Lee and re-releasing the song with a new vocal featuring altered lyrics. The singer countered allegations of antisemitism, arguing that reviews had misinterpreted the context of the song, either unintentionally or deliberately.","image":"Mjtdcau.jpg.webp"}
