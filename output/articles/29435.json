{"title":"Mescaline","summary":"Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) is a naturally occurring psychedelic protoalkaloid of the substituted phenethylamine class, known for its hallucinogenic effects comparable to those of LSD and psilocybin. It occurs naturally in the San Pedro cactus (Trichocereus (Echinopsis) pachanoi),[1] the Peruvian torch (Trichocereus peruvianus (Echinopsis peruviana)),[2] the Bolivian torch cactus (Echinopsis lageniformis),[3] the peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii),[4] and other species of cacti. It is also found in small amounts in certain members of the bean family, Fabaceae, including Acacia berlandieri.[5] However those claims concerning Acacia species have been challenged and have been unsupported in any additional analysis.[6]","image":"Mescaline_Structural_Formulae_bondline.svg.png.webp"}
