{"title":"Separation process","summary":"A separation process is a method that converts a mixture or solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures.[1] At least one product mixture of the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents. In some cases, a separation may fully divide the mixture into pure constituents.  Separations exploit differences in chemical properties or physical properties (such as size, shape, mass, density, or chemical affinity) between the constituents of a mixture.","image":"Haber-Bosch-En.svg.png.webp"}
