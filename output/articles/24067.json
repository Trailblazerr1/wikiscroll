{"title":"Jude the Apostle","summary":"Jude (Greek: Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου translit. Ioúdas Iakóvou) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. He is generally identified with Thaddeus (Greek: Θαδδαῖος; Coptic: ⲑⲁⲇⲇⲉⲟⲥ; Syriac/Aramaic: ܝܗܘܕܐ ܫܠܝܚܐ[4]), and is also variously called Jude of James, Jude Thaddaeus, Judas Thaddaeus or Lebbaeus.[5] He is sometimes identified with Jude, the brother of Jesus, but is clearly distinguished from Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Jesus prior to his crucifixion. Catholic writer Michal Hunt suggests that Judas Thaddaeus became known as Jude after early translators of the New Testament from Greek into English sought to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot and subsequently abbreviated his forename.[6] Most versions of the New Testament in languages other than English and French refer to Judas and Jude by the same name.[7]","image":"Anthonis_van_Dyck_088.jpg.webp"}
