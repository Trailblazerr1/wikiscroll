{"title":"Nonfiction","summary":"Nonfiction (also spelled non-fiction) is any document or media content that intends, in good faith, to present only truth and accuracy regarding information, events, or people.[1]  Nonfictional content may be presented either objectively or subjectively. Sometimes taking the form of a story, nonfiction is one of the fundamental divisions of narrative writing (specifically, prose)[2]â€” in contrast to fiction, which offers information, events, or characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary, or else leaves open if and how the work refers to reality.[1][3]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Nonfiction"}
