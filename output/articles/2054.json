{"title":"Acid rock","summary":"Acid rock is a loosely defined type of rock music[1] that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage punk[3] movement and helped launch the psychedelic subculture. Named after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the style is generally defined by heavy, distorted guitars, lyrics with drug references, and long improvised jams.  Much of the style overlaps with '60s punk, proto-metal, and early heavy, blues-based hard rock.","image":"Vietnamdem.jpg.webp","url":"Acid_rock"}
