{"title":"Census in Australia","summary":"The Census in Australia, officially the Census of Population and Housing, is the national census in Australia that occurs every five years.[1] The census collects key demographic, social and economic data from all people in Australia on census night, including overseas visitors and residents of Australian external territories, only excluding foreign diplomats.[2] The census is the largest and most significant statistical event in Australia and is run by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).[3] Every person must complete the census, although some personal questions are not compulsory.[4] The penalty for failing to complete the census after being directed to by the Australian Statistician is one federal penalty unit, or A$220.[5] The Australian Bureau of Statistics Act 1975 and Census and Statistics Act 1905 authorise the ABS to collect, store, and share anonymised data.[6]","image":"ABS_Census_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Census_in_Australia"}
