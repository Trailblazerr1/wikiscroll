{"title":"Perennial plant","summary":"A perennial plant or simply perennial  is a plant that lives more than two years.[1] The term (per- + -ennial, \"through the years\") is often used to differentiate a plant from shorter-lived annuals and biennials. The term is also widely used to distinguish plants with little or no woody growth (secondary growth in girth) from trees and shrubs, which are also technically perennials.[2]","image":"Cykoria_podroznik_pokroj.jpg.webp","url":"Perennial_plant"}
