{"title":"Taoism","summary":"Taoism (/ˈtaʊɪzəm/), or Daoism (/ˈdaʊɪzəm/), is a philosophical and spiritual tradition of Chinese origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the Tao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: Dào; lit. 'Way', or Dao). In Taoism, the Tao is the source, pattern and substance of everything that exists.[3][4] Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving \"perfection\"  by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the all, called \"the way\" or \"Tao\".[3][5] Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (action without intention), \"naturalness\", simplicity, spontaneity and the Three Treasures: 慈, \"compassion\", 儉, \"frugality\" and 不敢爲天下先, \"humility\".","image":"Tao.svg.png.webp"}
