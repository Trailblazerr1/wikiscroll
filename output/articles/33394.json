{"title":"Osteoarthritis","summary":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of degenerative joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone.[5] The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness.[1] Usually the symptoms progress slowly over  years.[1] Initially they may occur only after exercise but can become constant over time.[1] Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and, when the back is affected, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs.[1] The most commonly involved joints are the two near the ends of the fingers and the joint at the base of the thumbs; the knee and hip joints; and the joints of the neck and lower back.[1] Joints on one side of the body are often more affected than those on the other.[1] The symptoms can interfere with work and normal daily activities.[1] Unlike some other types of arthritis, only the joints, not internal organs, are affected.[1]","image":"Heberden-Arthrose.JPG.webp"}
