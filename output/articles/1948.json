{"title":"Absolute monarchy","summary":"Absolute monarchy[1][2] (or absolutism as doctrine) is a form of monarchy in which the monarch holds supreme autocratic authority, principally not being restricted by written laws, legislature, or unwritten customs.[3] These are often hereditary monarchies. In contrast, in constitutional monarchies, the head of state's authority derives from or is legally bound or restricted by a constitution, legislature or unwritten customs.[3]","image":"Salman_2017.jpg.webp"}
