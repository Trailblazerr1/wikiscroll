{"title":"Non-aggression principle","summary":"The non-aggression principle (NAP), also called the non-aggression axiom, is a concept in which aggression, defined as initiating or threatening any forceful interference with either an individual or their property,[note 1] is inherently wrong.[1][2] It is considered by some to be a defining principle of libertarianism in the United States[3] and is also a prominent idea in anarcho-capitalism and minarchism.[4][5][6][7] In contrast to pacifism, the NAP does not forbid forceful defense.[3] There is no single or universal interpretation or definition of the NAP as it faces several definitional issues, including those revolving around intellectual property, force, abortion, and other topics.","image":"Yellow_flag_waving.svg.png.webp"}
