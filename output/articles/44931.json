{"title":"Third Way","summary":"The Third Way is a political position akin to centrism that attempts to reconcile right-wing and left-wing politics by advocating a varying synthesis of centre-right economic platforms with some centre-left social policies.[1][2] The Third Way was created as a re-evaluation of political policies within various centre to centre-left progressive movements in response to doubt regarding the economic viability of the state and the overuse of economic interventionist policies that had previously been popularised by Keynesianism, but which at that time contrasted with the rise of popularity for neoliberalism and the New Right starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.[3] The Third Way has been promoted by social liberal[4] and social-democratic parties.[5] In the United States, a leading proponent of the Third Way was 42nd President Bill Clinton, who was in office from 1993â€“2001.[6]","image":"Yellow_flag_waving.svg.png.webp"}
