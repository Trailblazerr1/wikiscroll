{"title":"Wolf spider","summary":"Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae, from the Ancient Greek word λύκος, meaning \"wolf\". They are robust and agile hunters with excellent eyesight. They live mostly in solitude, hunt alone, and do not spin webs. Some are opportunistic hunters, pouncing upon prey as they find it or chasing it over short distances; others wait for passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow.","image":"Wolf_Spider_rpp.jpg.webp"}
