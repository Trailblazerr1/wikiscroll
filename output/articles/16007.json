{"title":"Ferguson unrest","summary":"The Ferguson unrest (sometimes called the Ferguson uprising, Ferguson protests, or Ferguson riots) in Ferguson, Missouri, involved protests and riots beginning on August 10, 2014, the day after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. The unrest sparked a vigorous debate in the United States about the relationship between law enforcement officers and African Americans, the militarization of police, and the use-of-force law in Missouri and nationwide. Continued activism expanded the issues to include modern-day debtors prisons,[9] for-profit policing,[10] and school segregation.[11]","image":"Ferguson_Day_6%2C_Picture_44.png.webp"}
