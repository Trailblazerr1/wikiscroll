{"title":"Dolphinarium","summary":"A dolphinarium is an aquarium for dolphins. The dolphins are usually kept in a large pool, though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea, either for research or public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.","image":"Dolphinarium_Boudewjinpark.JPG.webp","url":"Dolphinarium"}
