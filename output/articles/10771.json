{"title":"Competition (biology)","summary":"Competition is an  interaction between organisms or species in which both the organisms are harmed. Limited supply of at least one resource (such as food, water, and territory) used by both can be a factor.[1] Competition both within and between species is an important topic in ecology, especially community ecology. Competition is one of many interacting biotic and abiotic factors that affect community structure. Competition among members of the same species is known as intraspecific competition, while competition between individuals of different species is known as interspecific competition. Competition is not always straightforward, and can occur in both a direct and indirect fashion.[2]","image":"Clone_war_of_sea_anemones_2-17-08-2.jpg.webp","url":"Competition_(biology)"}
