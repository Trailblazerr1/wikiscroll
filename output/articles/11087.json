{"title":"Convenience store","summary":"A convenience store, convenience shop, corner store, or corner shop is a small retail business that stocks a range of everyday items such as coffee, groceries, snack foods, confectionery, soft drinks, tobacco products, lottery tickets, over-the-counter drugs, toiletries, newspapers, and magazines.[1][2][3][4][5] In some jurisdictions, convenience stores are licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, although many such jurisdictions limit such beverages to those with relatively low alcohol content such as beer and wine. Such stores may also offer money order and wire transfer services, along with the use of a fax machine or photocopier for a small per-copy cost. Some also offer to sell tickets or recharge a smart card, like the OPUS card in Montreal.[6] They differ from general stores and village shops in that they are not in a rural location and are used as a convenient supplement to larger stores.","image":"Convenience_store_interior.jpg.webp","url":"Convenience_store"}
