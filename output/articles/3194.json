{"title":"Ambulocetus","summary":"Ambulocetus (Latin ambulare \"to walk\" + cetus \"whale\") is a genus of early amphibious cetacean[lower-alpha 1] from the Kuldana Formation in Pakistan, roughly 48 or 47 million years ago during the Early Eocene (Lutetian). It contains one species, Ambulocetus natans (Latin natans \"swimming\"). Ambulocetus is known primarily from a single skeleton which is about 80% complete, and is among the most completely known Eocene cetaceans, instrumental in the study of cetacean evolution and the transition from land to sea. It had four functional limbs, and was the first cetacean discovered preserving a suite of adaptations consistent with an amphibious lifestyle. Ambulocetus is classified in the group Archaeoceti—the ancient forerunners of modern cetaceans whose members span the transition from land to sea—and in the family Ambulocetidae, which  includes Himalayacetus and Gandakasia (also from the Eocene of the Indian subcontinent).","image":"AmbulocetusNatansPisa.JPG.webp","url":"Ambulocetus"}
