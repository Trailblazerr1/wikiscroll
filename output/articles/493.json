{"title":"2010 Asian Games","summary":"The 2010 Asian Games (Chinese: 2010年亚洲运动会; pinyin: Èr líng yī líng nián yǎzhōu yùndònghuì), also known as the XVI Asian Games (Chinese: 第十六届亚洲运动会; pinyin: dì shíliù jiè yǎzhōu yùndònghuì), was a multi-sport event celebrated in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China from 12 to 27 November 2010, although several events had commenced from 7 November 2010. This was the second time China had hosted the Games, in which Guangzhou was the second Chinese city to host, after Beijing in 1990. A total of 9,704 athletes from 45 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 476 events from 42 sports and disciplines (28 Olympic sports and 14 non-Olympic sports), making it the largest event in the history of the Games. Due to reductions in the number of sports to be contested for the 2014 Asian Games, these Games marked the final time that six non-Olympic events would be held during the Asian Games.","image":"Guangzhou2010.svg.png.webp","url":"2010_Asian_Games"}
