{"title":"New Worlds (magazine)","summary":"New Worlds was a British science fiction magazine that began in 1936 as a fanzine called Novae Terrae. John Carnell, who became Novae Terrae's editor in 1939, renamed it New Worlds that year. He was instrumental in turning it into a professional publication in 1946 and was the first editor of the new incarnation. It became the leading UK science fiction magazine; the period to 1960 has been described by science fiction historian Mike Ashley as the magazine's \"Golden Age\".[1]","image":"Newworlds.jpg.webp","url":"New_Worlds_(magazine)"}
