{"title":"Negative binomial distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a sequence of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials before a specified (non-random) number of failures (denoted r) occurs.[2] For example, we can define rolling a 6 on a die as a failure, and rolling any other number as a success, and ask how many successful rolls will occur before we see the third failure (r = 3). In such a case, the probability distribution of the number of non-6s that appear will be a negative binomial distribution. We could similarly use the negative binomial distribution to model the number of days a certain machine works before it breaks down  (r = 1).","image":"Negbinomial.gif","url":"Negative_binomial_distribution"}
