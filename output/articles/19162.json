{"title":"Gulf of Mexico","summary":"The Gulf of Mexico (Spanish: Golfo de MÃ©xico) is an ocean basin and a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean,[1] largely surrounded by the North American continent.[2] It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States; on the southwest and south by the Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo; and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, which border the Gulf on the north, are often referred to as the \"Third Coast\" of the United States (in addition to its Atlantic and Pacific coasts).","image":"Gfp-texas-galveston-island-state-park-inlet-shore.jpg.webp","url":"Gulf_of_Mexico"}
