{"title":"Venezuelan refugee crisis","summary":"The Venezuelan migration and refugee crisis (also known as the Bolivarian diaspora), the largest recorded refugee crisis in the Americas,[5] refers to the emigration of millions of Venezuelans from their native country during the presidencies of Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro because of the Bolivarian Revolution.[1][2][6] The revolution was an attempt by Chávez and later Maduro to establish a cultural and political hegemony,[7][8][9] which culminated in the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela.[10] The resulting refugee crisis has been compared to those faced by Cuban exiles, Syrian refugees and those affected by the European migrant crisis.[11][12] The Bolivarian government has denied any migratory crisis, stating that the United Nations and others are attempting to justify foreign intervention within Venezuela.[13]","image":"©UNICEF-ECU-2018-Arcos.jpg.webp","url":"Venezuelan_refugee_crisis"}
