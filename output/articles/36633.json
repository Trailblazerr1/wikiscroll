{"title":"QR code","summary":"A QR code (an initialism for Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode)[1][2] invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave.[3][4] A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.[5]","image":"QR_code_for_mobile_English_Wikipedia.svg.png.webp","url":"QR_code"}
