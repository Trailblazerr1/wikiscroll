{"title":"The Masque of the Red Death","summary":"\"The Masque of the Red Death\" (originally published as \"The Mask of the Red Death: A Fantasy\") is a short story by American writer Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 1842. The story follows Prince Prospero's attempts to avoid a dangerous plague, known as the Red Death, by hiding in his abbey. He, along with many other wealthy nobles, hosts a masquerade ball in seven rooms of the abbey, each decorated with a different color. In the midst of their revelry, a mysterious figure disguised as a Red Death victim enters and makes his way through each of the rooms. Prospero dies after confronting this stranger, whose \"costume\" proves to contain nothing tangible inside it; the guests also die in turn.","image":"lossy-page1-200px-The_dagger_dropped_gleaming_upon_the_sable_carpet_-_Harry_Clarke_(BL_12703.i.43).tif.jpg.webp"}
