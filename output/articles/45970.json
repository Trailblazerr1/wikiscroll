{"title":"Trinity College Dublin","summary":"Trinity College (Irish: Coláiste na Tríonóide), officially the College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity of Queen Elizabeth near Dublin, is the sole constituent college of the University of Dublin, a research university in Dublin, Ireland.[9] Queen Elizabeth I founded the college in 1592 as \"the mother of a university\" that was modelled after the collegiate universities of Oxford and Cambridge, but unlike these affiliated institutions, only one college was ever established; as such, the designations \"Trinity College\" and \"University of Dublin\" are usually synonymous for practical purposes.[10]","image":"Trinity_College_(8101920307).jpg.webp"}
