{"title":"Open-wheel car","summary":"An open-wheel car (formula car, or often single-seater car in British English) is a car with the wheels outside the car's main body, and usually having only one seat. Open-wheel cars contrast with street cars, sports cars, stock cars, and touring cars, which have their wheels below the body or inside fenders. Open-wheel cars are built both for road racing and oval track racing. Street-legal open-wheel cars, such as the Ariel Atom, are very scarce as they are often impractical for everyday use.[1]","image":"FIA_F1_Austria_2018_Nr._14_Alonso.jpg.webp","url":"Open-wheel_car"}
