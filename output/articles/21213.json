{"title":"Hyaluronic acid","summary":"Hyaluronic acid (/ˌhaɪ.əljʊəˈrɒnɪk/;[2][3] abbreviated HA; conjugate base hyaluronate), also called hyaluronan, is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan distributed widely throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues. It is unique among glycosaminoglycans as it is non-sulfated, forms in the plasma membrane instead of the Golgi apparatus, and can be very large: human synovial HA averages about 7 million Da per molecule, or about 20,000 disaccharide monomers,[4] while other sources mention 3–4 million Da.[5]","image":"Hyaluronan.svg.png.webp","url":"Hyaluronic_acid"}
