{"title":"Esch-sur-Alzette","summary":"Esch-sur-Alzette (French: [ɛʃ syʁ alzɛt]; Luxembourgish: Esch-Uelzecht [ˌæʒ ˈuəltsəɕt] (listen); German: Esch an der Alzette [ˈɛʃ ʔan deːɐ̯ ʔalˈzɛt] or Esch an der Alzig) is a commune with town status in south-western Luxembourg.  It is the country's second \"city\", and its second-most populous commune, with a population of 35,040 inhabitants, as of 2018. It lies in the south-west of the country, on the border with France and in the valley of the Alzette, which flows through the town. The town is usually referred to as just Esch; however, the full name distinguishes it from the village and commune of Esch-sur-Sûre which lies 45 kilometres (28 miles) further north. The country's capital, Luxembourg City, is roughly 15 km (9.3 mi) to the north-east. The city was selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2022, alongside Kaunas and Novi Sad.","image":"Esch_vum_Bierg1.JPG.webp","url":"Esch-sur-Alzette"}
