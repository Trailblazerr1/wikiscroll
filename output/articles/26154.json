{"title":"Lightsaber","summary":"A lightsaber (also referred to as a laser sword or a ren[1]) is a fictional energy sword featured throughout the Star Wars franchise. A typical lightsaber is depicted as a luminescent blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm) in length.[2] First introduced in the original Star Wars film,[lower-alpha 1] it has since appeared in most Star Wars films, with at least one lightsaber duel occurring in each installment of the \"Skywalker saga\". The lightsaber's distinct appearance was created using rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for the prequel and sequel trilogies.","image":"Lightsaber%2C_silver_hilt%2C_blue_blade.png.webp","url":"Lightsaber"}
