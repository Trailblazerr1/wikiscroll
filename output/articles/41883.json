{"title":"St. Francis Dam","summary":"The St. Francis Dam was a concrete gravity dam built from 1924 to 1926 to serve Los Angeles' growing water needs, that catastrophically failed in 1928 due to a defective soil foundation, claiming the lives of at least 431 people. The collapse of the St. Francis Dam is considered to be one of the worst American civil engineering disasters of the 20th century and remains the second-greatest loss of life in California's history, after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.","image":"St_Francis_Dam_crop.jpg.webp"}
