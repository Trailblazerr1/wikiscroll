{"title":"Diphtheria","summary":"Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.[1] Most infections are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical course, but in some outbreaks more than 10% of those diagnosed with the disease may die.[2]  Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe[2] and usually start two to five days after exposure.[1] Symptoms often come on fairly gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever.[2] In severe cases, a grey or white patch develops in the throat.[1][2] This can block the airway and create a barking cough as in croup.[2] The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes.[1] A form of diphtheria which involves the skin, eyes or genitals also exists.[1][2] Complications may include myocarditis, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding problems due to low levels of platelets.[1] Myocarditis may result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may result in paralysis.[1]","image":"Diphtheria_bull_neck.5325_lores.jpg.webp"}
