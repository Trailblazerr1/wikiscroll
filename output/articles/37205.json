{"title":"Rattan","summary":"Rattan, also spelled ratan, is the name for roughly 600 species of Old World climbing palms belonging to subfamily Calamoideae. The greatest diversity of rattan palm species and genera are in the closed-canopy old-growth tropical forests of Southeast Asia, though they can also be found in other parts of tropical Asia and Africa.[1][2] Most rattan palms are ecologically considered lianas due to their climbing habits, unlike other palm species. Though a few species also have tree-like or shrub-like habits.[2]","image":"Thatiyan_Cuural_(Malayalam-_തടിയന്‍_ചൂരല്‍)_(5661614812).jpg.webp","url":"Rattan"}
