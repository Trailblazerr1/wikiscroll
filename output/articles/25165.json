{"title":"Kwik-E-Mart","summary":"The Kwik-E-Mart (spelled \"Quick-E-Mart\" in \"Bart the General\") is a convenience store in the animated television series The Simpsons. It is a parody of American convenience stores, such as 7-Eleven and Cumberland Farms, and depicts many of the stereotypes about them. It is notorious for its high prices and the poor quality of its merchandise. It is formerly run by an Indian-American named Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.[1] It first appeared in the 1990 episode \"The Telltale Head\" and has since become a common setting in The Simpsons.","image":"Kwik-e-mart.png.webp","url":"Kwik-E-Mart"}
