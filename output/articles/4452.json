{"title":"Arsenal F.C.–Manchester United F.C. rivalry","summary":"Although Arsenal and Manchester United have frequently been in the same division in English football since 1919, the rivalry between the two clubs only became a fierce one in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when the teams regularly competed against each other for the Premier League title and FA Cup. There was also an enmity between the managers, Arsenal's Arsène Wenger (1996–2018) and United's Sir Alex Ferguson (1986–2013), and club captains Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane,[1][2][3] and their contests often involved on-field trouble – seven red cards were shown in matches from February 1997 to February 2005.[4] The league fixture in September 2003, known as the \"Battle of Old Trafford\", was marred by a mêlée instigated by Arsenal players, who felt striker Ruud van Nistelrooy had cheated to get Vieira sent off. A season later, Manchester United ended Arsenal's unbeaten run in controversial circumstances, which led to more disorder, this time in the tunnel.","image":"Manchester_United_v_Arsenal%2C_November_2016_(18).JPG.webp"}
