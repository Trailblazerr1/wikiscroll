{"title":"Charge-coupled device","summary":"A charge-coupled device (CCD) is an integrated circuit containing an array of linked, or coupled, capacitors. Under the control of an external circuit, each capacitor can transfer its electric charge to a neighboring capacitor. CCD sensors are a major technology used in digital imaging.","image":"Delta-Doped_Charged_Coupled_Devices_(CCD)_for_Ultra-Violet_and_Visible_Detection.jpg.webp"}
