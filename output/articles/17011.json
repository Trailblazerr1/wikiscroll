{"title":"Freeganism","summary":"Freeganism is an ideology of limited participation in the conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources, particularly through recovering wasted goods like food.[1] The word \"freegan\" is a portmanteau of \"free\" and \"vegan\".[2] While vegans avoid buying animal products as an act of protest against animal exploitation, freegans—at least in theory—avoid buying anything as an act of protest against the food system in general.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
