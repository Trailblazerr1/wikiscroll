{"title":"Glucocorticoid","summary":"Glucocorticoids (or, less commonly, glucocorticosteroids) are a class of corticosteroids, which are a class of steroid hormones. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor[1]  that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The name \"glucocorticoid\" is a portmanteau (glucose + cortex + steroid) and is composed from its role in regulation of glucose metabolism, synthesis in the adrenal cortex, and its steroidal structure (see structure to the right).","image":"Cortisol2.svg.png.webp"}
