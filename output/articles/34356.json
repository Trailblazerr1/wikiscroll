{"title":"Peninsula","summary":"A peninsula (Latin: paeninsula from paene 'almost' and insula 'island') is a landform surrounded by water on most of its border while being connected to a mainland from which it extends.[1][2][3][4] The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as a  body of water. A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a \"peninsula\" within the (almost closed) loop of water. A peninsula is land with bodies of water on three sides of it.","image":"STS-95_Florida_From_Space.jpg.webp"}
