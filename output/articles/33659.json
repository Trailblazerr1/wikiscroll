{"title":"Pair production","summary":"Pair production is the creation of a subatomic particle and its antiparticle from a neutral boson. Examples include creating an electron and a positron, a muon and an antimuon, or a proton and an antiproton. Pair production often refers specifically to a photon creating an electron–positron pair near a nucleus. As energy must be conserved, for pair production to occur, the incoming energy of the photon must be above a threshold of at least the total rest mass energy of the two particles created.  (As the electron is the lightest, hence, lowest mass/energy, elementary particle, it requires the least energetic photons of all possible pair-production processes.)  Conservation of energy and momentum are the principal constraints on the process.[1] \nAll other conserved quantum numbers (angular momentum, electric charge, lepton number) of the produced particles must sum to zero –  thus the created particles shall have opposite values of each other. For instance, if one particle has electric charge of +1 the other must have electric charge of −1, or if one particle has strangeness of +1 then another one must have strangeness of −1.","image":"Light-matter_interaction_-_schematic.svg.png.webp"}
