{"title":"United States federal budget","summary":"The United States federal budget comprises the spending and revenues of the U.S. federal government. The budget is the financial representation of the priorities of the government, reflecting historical debates and competing economic philosophies. The government primarily spends on healthcare, retirement, and defense programs. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides extensive analysis of the budget and its economic effects. It has reported that large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levelsâ€”from 98 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 195 percent by 2050.[1]","image":"2020_US_Federal_Revenues_and_Outlays.png.webp","url":"United_States_federal_budget"}
