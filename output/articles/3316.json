{"title":"American pika","summary":"The American pika (Ochotona princeps), a diurnal species of pika, is found in the mountains of western North America, usually in boulder fields at or above the tree line. They are herbivorous, smaller relatives of rabbits and hares.[4] Pikas have two different ways of foraging; they either directly consume food or they cache food in piles for the winter (haying).","image":"Ochotona_princeps_rockies.JPG.webp"}
