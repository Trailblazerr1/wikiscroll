{"title":"Crowdsourcing","summary":"Crowdsourcing is a sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods or services—including ideas, voting, micro-tasks, and finances—from a large, relatively open, and often rapidly evolving group of participants. As of 2021, crowdsourcing typically involves using the internet to attract and divide work between participants to achieve a cumulative result, however it may not always be an online activity. The word \"crowdsourcing\" itself – a portmanteau of \"crowd\" and \"outsourcing\" – was allegedly coined in 2005.[1][2][3][4] In comparison to outsourcing, crowdsourcing usually involves a less-specific, more public group.[5][6][7] Advantages of using crowdsourcing may include improved costs, speed, quality, flexibility, scalability, or diversity.[8][9] Common crowdsourcing methods include competitions, virtual labor markets, and open online collaboration. Some forms of crowdsourcing, such as in \"idea competitions\" or \"innovation contests\" provide ways for organizations to learn beyond the \"base of minds\" provided by their employees (e.g. LEGO Ideas).[10][11] Monotonous \"microtasks\" performed in parallel by large, paid crowds (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk) are another form of crowdsourcing. Not-for-profit organizations have used crowdsourcing to develop common goods (e.g. Wikipedia).[12]","image":"Crowdtesting.jpg.webp"}
