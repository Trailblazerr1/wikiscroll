{"title":"Second Triumvirate","summary":"The Second Triumvirate (43â€“32 BC) was a political alliance formed after the Roman dictator Julius Caesar's assassination, comprising Caesar's adopted son Octavian (the future emperor Augustus) and the dictator's two most important supporters, Mark Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. The triumvirate for organizing the republic (Latin: tresviri rei publicae constituendae),[2] as it was formally known, ruled the Roman Republic essentially as a military dictatorship, with each of the triumvirs assuming charge of an individual set of provinces. Unlike the earlier First Triumvirate (Caesar, Pompey and Crassus),[3][4] the Second was an official, legally established institution, whose overwhelming power in the Roman state was given full legal sanction and whose authority outranked that of all other magistrates, including the consuls.","image":"Antony_with_Octavian_aureus.jpg.webp","url":"Second_Triumvirate"}
