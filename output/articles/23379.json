{"title":"Jezero (crater)","summary":"Jezero[lower-alpha 1] is a crater on Mars in the Syrtis Major quadrangle,[2] about 45.0 km (28.0 mi) in diameter. Thought to have once been flooded with water, the crater contains a fan-delta deposit rich in clays.[3] The lake in the crater was present when valley networks were forming on Mars. Besides having a delta, the crater shows point bars and inverted channels. From a study of the delta and channels, it was concluded that the lake inside the crater probably formed during a period in which there was continual surface runoff.[4]","image":"Perseverance's_First_Full-Color_Look_at_Mars.png.webp"}
