{"title":"Flatback sea turtle","summary":"The Australian flatback sea turtle (Natator depressus)[3] is a species of sea turtle in the family Cheloniidae. The species is endemic to the sandy beaches and shallow coastal waters of the Australian continental shelf. This turtle gets its common name from the fact that its shell has a flattened or lower dome than the other sea turtles. It can be olive green to grey with a cream underside. It averages from 76 to 96 cm (30 to 38 inches) in carapace length and can weigh from 70 to 90 kg (154 to 198 lb). The hatchlings, when emerging from nests, are larger than other sea turtle hatchlings when they hatch. The flatback turtle is listed by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as data deficient, meaning there is insufficient scientific information to determine its conservation status at this time.[1] It was previously listed as vulnerable in 1994.[4] It is not as threatened as other sea turtles due to its small dispersal range.[5] This animal can be 31 to 37 inches long and about 100kg in weight","image":"Natator_depressus00.jpg.webp"}
