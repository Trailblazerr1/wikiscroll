{"title":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace","summary":"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is the sixth studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, released on September 25, 2007, through Roswell and RCA Records. The album is noted for a blend of regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work. Grohl tried to focus on songs with messages that resonated with his audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from the birth of his daughter.","image":"Foos-ESPG.jpg.webp","url":"Echoes,_Silence,_Patience_&_Grace"}
