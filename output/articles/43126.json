{"title":"Synod","summary":"A synod (/ˈsɪnəd/) is a council of a church, usually convened to decide an issue of doctrine, administration or application. The word synod comes from the Greek: σύνοδος [ˈsinoðos] meaning \"assembly\" or \"meeting\" and is analogous with the Latin word concilium meaning \"council\". Originally, synods were meetings of bishops, and the word is still used in that sense in Catholicism, Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy. In modern usage, the word often refers to the governing body of a particular church, whether its members are meeting or not. It is also sometimes used to refer to a church that is governed by a synod.","image":"Anonymous_Diocesan_synod_in_Kraków's_Saint_Mary's_Church.jpg.webp","url":"Synod"}
