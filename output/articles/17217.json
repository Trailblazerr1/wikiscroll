{"title":"Fused quartz","summary":"Fused quartz, fused silica or quartz glass is a glass consisting of almost pure silica (silicon dioxide, SiO2) in amorphous (non-crystalline) form.  This differs from all other commercial glasses in which other ingredients are added which change the glasses' optical and physical properties, such as lowering the melt temperature. Fused quartz, therefore, has high working and melting temperatures, making it less desirable for most common applications.","image":"Einstein_gyro_gravity_probe_b.jpg.webp","url":"Fused_quartz"}
