{"title":"The Coca-Cola Company","summary":"The Coca-Cola Company is an American multinational beverage corporation incorporated under Delaware's General Corporation Law[lower-alpha 1] and headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The Coca-Cola Company has interests in the manufacturing, retailing, and marketing of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. The company produces Coca-Cola, the  sugary drink for which it is best known, invented in 1886 by pharmacist John Stith Pemberton. At the time, the product was made with coca leaves, which added an amount of cocaine to the drink, and with kola nuts, which added caffeine, so that the coca and the kola together provided a  stimulative effect.  This stimulative effect is the reason the drink was sold to the public as a healthy \"tonic,\" and the coca and the kola are also the source of the name of the product and of the company.[2] In 1889, the formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $68,000 in 2021) to Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated The Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892.","image":"The_Coca-Cola_Company_(2020).svg.png.webp","url":"The_Coca-Cola_Company"}
