{"title":"Miocene","summary":"The Miocene ( /ˈmaɪ.əˌsiːn, ˈmaɪ.oʊ-/ MY-ə-seen, MY-oh-[6][7]) is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago (Ma). The Miocene was named by Scottish geologist Charles Lyell; its name comes from the Greek words μείων (meiōn, \"less\") and καινός (kainos, \"new\")[8][9] and means \"less recent\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene.[10] The Miocene is preceded by the Oligocene and is followed by the Pliocene.","image":"Miocene_Chart.jpg.webp","url":"Miocene"}
