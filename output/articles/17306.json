{"title":"Gaia","summary":"In Greek mythology, Gaia (/ˈɡeɪə, ˈɡaɪə/;[1] from Ancient Greek Γαῖα, a poetical form of Γῆ Gē, \"land\" or \"earth\"),[2] also spelled Gaea /ˈdʒiːə/,[1] is the personification of the Earth[3] and one of the Greek primordial deities. Gaia is the ancestral mother—sometimes parthenogenic—of all life. She is the mother of Uranus (the sky), from whose sexual union she bore the Titans (themselves parents of many of the Olympian gods), the Cyclopes, and the Giants; as well as of Pontus (the sea), from whose union she bore the primordial sea gods. Her equivalent in the Roman pantheon was Terra.[4]","image":"Feuerbach_Gaea.jpg.webp","url":"Gaia"}
