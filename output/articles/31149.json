{"title":"Nabopolassar","summary":"Nabopolassar (Babylonian cuneiform:  Nabû-apla-uṣur,[4][5][6] meaning \"Nabu, protect the son\")[6] was the founder and first king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from his coronation as king of Babylon in 626 BC to his death in 605 BC. Though initially only aimed at restoring and securing the independence of Babylonia, Nabopolassar's uprising against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which had ruled Babylonia for more than a century, eventually led to the complete destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in its place.","image":"Nabopolassar_in_Akkadian.png.webp"}
