{"title":"Fishing rod","summary":"A fishing rod  is a long, flexible rod used by fishermen to catch fish. At its simplest, a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an angle, hence the term angling). The length of the rod can vary between 2 and 50 feet (0.5 and 15Â m). To entice fish, bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line. The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish.","image":"Deepsea.JPG.webp","url":"Fishing_rod"}
