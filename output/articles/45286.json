{"title":"Tissue plasminogen activator","summary":"Tissue plasminogen activator (abbreviated tPA or PLAT) is a protein involved in the breakdown of blood clots. It is a serine protease (EC 3.4.21.68) found on endothelial cells, the cells that line the blood vessels. As an enzyme, it catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, the major enzyme responsible for clot breakdown. Human tPA has a molecular weight of ~70 kDa in the single-chain form.[5]","image":"Protein_PLAT_PDB_1a5h.png.webp","url":"Tissue_plasminogen_activator"}
