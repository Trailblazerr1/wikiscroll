{"title":"Agrobacterium tumefaciens","summary":"Agrobacterium radiobacter (more commonly known as Agrobacterium tumefaciens)[7][6][8] is the causal agent of crown gall disease (the formation of tumours) in over 140 species of eudicots. It is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative soil bacterium.[1] Symptoms are caused by the insertion of a small segment of DNA (known as the T-DNA, for 'transfer DNA', not to be confused with tRNA that transfers amino acids during protein synthesis), from a plasmid into the plant cell,[9] which is incorporated at a semi-random location into the plant genome. Plant genomes can be engineered by use of Agrobacterium for the delivery of sequences hosted in T-DNA binary vectors.","image":"Agrobacterium-tumefaciens.png.webp"}
