{"title":"Cao Cao","summary":"Cao Cao (pronunciation ; [tsʰǎu tsʰáu]; Chinese: 曹操; 155 – 15 March 220),[2] courtesy name Mengde (Chinese: 孟德), was a Chinese warlord, statesman and poet. He was the penultimate grand chancellor of the Eastern Han dynasty who rose to great power in the final years of the dynasty. As one of the central figures of the Three Kingdoms period, he laid the foundations for what was to become the state of Cao Wei and was posthumously honoured as \"Emperor Wu of Wei\" although he never officially claimed the title Emperor of China or proclaimed himself  \"Son of Heaven\" during his lifetime. He remains a controversial historical figure, and is often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant in subsequent literature; however, he has also been praised as a brilliant ruler, military genius, and great poet with unrivalled charisma who treated his subordinates like his family.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
