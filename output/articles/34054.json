{"title":"Passive smoking","summary":"Passive smoking is the inhalation of tobacco smoke, called secondhand smoke (SHS), or environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), by persons other than the intended \"active\" smoker. It occurs when tobacco smoke enters an environment, causing its inhalation by people within that environment. Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke causes disease, disability, and death.[1][2] The health risks of secondhand smoke are a matter of scientific consensus.[3][4][5] These risks have been a major motivation for smoke-free laws in workplaces and indoor public places, including restaurants, bars and night clubs, as well as some open public spaces.[6]","image":"Smoke-by-a-window-in-a-pub.jpg.webp"}
