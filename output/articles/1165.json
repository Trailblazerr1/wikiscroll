{"title":"Final Fantasy X","summary":"Final Fantasy X[lower-alpha 1] is a role-playing video game developed and published by Square as the tenth main entry in the Final Fantasy series. Originally released in 2001 for PlayStation 2, the game was re-released as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013, for PlayStation 4 in 2015, Microsoft Windows in 2016, and for Nintendo Switch and Xbox One in 2019. The game marks the Final Fantasy series transition from entirely pre-rendered backdrops to fully three-dimensional areas (though some areas were still pre-rendered), and is also the first in the series to feature voice acting. Final Fantasy X replaces the Active Time Battle (ATB) system with the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" (CTB) system, and uses a new leveling system called the \"Sphere Grid\".","image":"Ffxboxart.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fFinal_Fantasy_X"}
