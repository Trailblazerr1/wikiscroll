{"title":"Rainbow table","summary":"A rainbow table is a precomputed table for caching the output of cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes. Tables are usually used in recovering a key derivation function (or credit card numbers, etc.) up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters. It is a practical example of a spaceâ€“time tradeoff, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple key derivation function with one entry per hash. Use of a key derivation that employs a salt makes this attack infeasible.","image":"Dr._Oechslin_Rainbow_Table_Crypto_2003_Illustration.png.webp","url":"Rainbow_table"}
