{"title":"Partition function (statistical mechanics)","summary":"In physics, a partition function describes the statistical properties of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium.  Partition functions are functions of the thermodynamic state variables,  such as the temperature and volume. Most of the aggregate thermodynamic variables of the system, such as the total energy, free energy, entropy, and pressure, can be expressed in terms of the partition function or its derivatives. The partition function is dimensionless, it is a pure number.","image":"Increasing_disorder.svg.png.webp"}
