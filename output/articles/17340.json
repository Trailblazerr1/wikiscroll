{"title":"Galileo (satellite navigation)","summary":"Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016,[5] created by the European Union through the European Space Agency (ESA), operated by the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA),[6] headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic,[7] with two ground operations centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The â‚¬10 billion project[4][8] is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European nations do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time.[9] The use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services is free and open to everyone. The higher-precision capabilities will be available for free.[10] Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre precision, and better positioning services at higher latitudes than other positioning systems. Galileo is also to provide a new global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the MEOSAR system.","image":"Galileo_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Galileo_(satellite_navigation)"}
