{"title":"Docking (molecular)","summary":"In the field of molecular modeling, docking is a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to each other to form a stable complex.[1]  Knowledge of the preferred orientation in turn may be used to predict the strength of association or binding affinity between two molecules using, for example, scoring functions.","image":"Docking_representation_2.png.webp","url":"Docking_(molecular)"}
