{"title":"Egyptian language","summary":"The Egyptian language (Ancient Egyptian: 𓂋𓏺𓈖 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖, Middle Egyptian pronunciation: [ˈraʔ n̩ˈku.mat], Coptic: ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ)[1][8] is an Afro-Asiatic language which was spoken in ancient Egypt. Its attestation stretches over an extraordinarily long time, from the Old Egyptian stage (mid-4th millennium BC, Old Kingdom of Egypt). Its earliest known complete written sentence has been dated to about 2690 BC, which makes it one of the oldest recorded languages known, along with Sumerian.[9]","image":"hiero_D21.png.webp","url":"Egyptian_language"}
