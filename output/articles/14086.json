{"title":"Echinococcus granulosus","summary":"Echinococcus granulosus, also called the hydatid worm, hyper tape-worm or dog tapeworm, is a cyclophyllid cestode that dwells in the small intestine of canids as an adult, but which has important intermediate hosts such as livestock and humans, where it causes cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease.  The adult tapeworm ranges in length from 3 mm to 6 mm and has three proglottids (\"segments\") when intact—an immature proglottid, mature proglottid and a gravid proglottid.[1]  The average number of eggs per gravid proglottid is 823. Like all cyclophyllideans, E. granulosus has four suckers on its scolex (\"head\"), and E. granulosus also has a rostellum with hooks. Several strains of E. granulosus have been identified, and all but two are noted to be infective in humans.[2]","image":"Echinococcus_granulosus_scolex.jpg.webp","url":"Echinococcus_granulosus"}
