{"title":"Cataract","summary":"A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of the eye that leads to a decrease in vision.[1] Cataracts often develop slowly and can affect one or both eyes.[1] Symptoms may include faded colors, blurry or double vision, halos around light, trouble with bright lights, and trouble seeing at night.[1] This may result in trouble driving, reading, or recognizing faces.[7] Poor vision caused by cataracts may also result in an increased risk of falling and depression.[2] Cataracts cause half of all cases of blindness and 33% of visual impairment worldwide.[3][8]","image":"Cataract_in_human_eye.png.webp","url":"Cataract"}
