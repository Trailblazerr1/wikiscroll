{"title":"Odia script","summary":"The Odia script (Odia: ଓଡ଼ିଆ ଅକ୍ଷର, romanized: Oṛiā akṣara) is a Brahmic script used to write primarily Odia language and others including Sanskrit and other regional languages. The script has developed over more than 1000 years from a variant of Siddhaṃ script which was used in Eastern India, where the characteristic top line transformed into a distinct round umbrella shape due to the influence of palm leaf manuscripts and also being influenced by the neighbouring scripts from the Western and Southern regions.","image":"Odia_script.png.webp","url":"Odia_script"}
