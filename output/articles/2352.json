{"title":"Afro-Caribbean people","summary":"Afro-Caribbean people, or Caribbean people, are Caribbean people who trace their full or partial ancestry to Africa. The majority of the modern African-Caribbeans descend from Africans taken as slaves to colonial Caribbean via the trans-Atlantic slave trade between the 15th and 19th centuries to work primarily on various sugar plantations and in domestic households. Other names for the ethnic group include Black Caribbean, Afro or Black West Indian or Afro or Black Antillean. The term Afro-Caribbean was not coined by Caribbean people themselves but was first used by European Americans in the late 1960s.[6]","image":"Afro_caribbean_(8180243171).jpg.webp","url":"Afro-Caribbean_people"}
