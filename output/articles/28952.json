{"title":"Matthew Flinders","summary":"Captain Matthew Flinders (16 March 1774 â€“ 19 July 1814) was an English navigator and cartographer who led the first inshore circumnavigation of the landmass that is now known as Australia. He is also credited as being the first person to utilise the name Australia to describe the entirety of that continent including Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), a title he regarded as being \"more agreeable to the ear\" than previous names such as Terra Australis.[1]","image":"Toussaint_Antoine_DE_CHAZAL_DE_Chamerel_-_Portrait_of_Captain_Matthew_Flinders%2C_RN%2C_1774-1814_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp"}
