{"title":"Phospholipid","summary":"Phospholipids, also known as phosphatides,[1] are a class of lipids whose molecule has a hydrophilic \"head\" containing a phosphate group and two hydrophobic \"tails\" derived from fatty acids, joined by an alcohol residue (usually a glycerol molecule). Marine phospholipids typically have omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA integrated as part of the phospholipid molecule.[2] The phosphate group can be modified with simple organic molecules such as choline, ethanolamine or serine.","image":"Phospholipid_TvanBrussel.edit.jpg.webp","url":"Phospholipid"}
