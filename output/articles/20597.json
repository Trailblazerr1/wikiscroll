{"title":"Hit 'Em Up","summary":"\"Hit 'Em Up\" is a diss song by hip hop artist 2Pac, featuring the Outlawz. It is the B-side to the single \"How Do U Want It\", released on June 4, 1996. The song's lyrics contain vicious insults to several East Coast rappers, chiefly Shakur's former-friend-turned-rival, Christopher Wallace, also known by his stage name, the Notorious B.I.G (or colloquially, Biggie Smalls). The song was recorded at Can Am Studios in 1996. There is a previous version of this song recorded in October 1995. Reporter Chuck Philips, who interviewed Shakur at Can Am, described the song as \"a caustic antiâ€“East Coast jihad in which the rapper threatens to eliminate Biggie, Puff, and a slew of Bad Boy artists and other New York acts.\"[1] The song was produced by long-time collaborator Johnny \"J\". The video, itself described as infamous, includes impersonations of Biggie, Puffy and M.A.F.I.A. member Lil' Kim.","image":"2pac_-_Hit_'Em_Up_promo.jpg.webp"}
