{"title":"Semicolon","summary":"The semicolon or semi-colon[1] ; is a symbol commonly used as orthographic punctuation. In the English language, a semicolon is most commonly used to link (in a single sentence) two independent clauses that are closely related in thought. When a semicolon joins two or more ideas in one sentence, those ideas are then given equal rank.[2] Semicolons can also be used in place of commas to separate the items in a list, particularly when the elements of that list contain commas.[3]","image":"95950d7d5de21eb3c52211a746173b5ba504e92c.svg"}
