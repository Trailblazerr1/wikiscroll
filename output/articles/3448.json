{"title":"Anal fissure","summary":"An anal fissure is a break or tear in the skin of the anal canal. Anal fissures may be noticed by bright red anal bleeding on toilet paper and undergarments, or sometimes in the toilet. If acute they are painful after defecation,[1] but with chronic fissures, pain intensity often reduces. Anal fissures usually extend from the anal opening and are usually located posteriorly in the midline, probably because of the relatively unsupported nature and poor perfusion of the anal wall in that location. Fissure depth may be superficial or sometimes down to the underlying sphincter muscle. Untreated fissures develop a hood-like skin tag (sentinel piles) which cover the fissure and cause discomfort and pain.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
