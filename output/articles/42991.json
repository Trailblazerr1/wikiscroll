{"title":"Swamp","summary":"A swamp is a forested wetland.[1] Swamps are considered to be transition zones because both land and water play a role in creating this environment.[2] Swamps vary in size and are located all around the world. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water, or seawater. Freshwater swamps form along large rivers or lakes where they are critically dependent upon rainwater and seasonal flooding to maintain natural water level fluctuations.[2][3] Saltwater swamps are found along tropical and subtropical coastlines.[4] Some swamps have hammocks, or dry-land protrusions, covered by aquatic vegetation, or vegetation that tolerates periodic inundation[5] or soil saturation. The two main types of swamp are \"true\" or swamp forests and \"transitional\" or shrub swamps. In the boreal regions of Canada, the word swamp is colloquially used for what is more correctly termed a bog, fen, or muskeg. Some of the world's largest swamps are found along major rivers such as the Amazon, the Mississippi, and the Congo.[6]","image":"Florida_freshwater_swamp_usgov_image.jpg.webp","url":"Swamp"}
