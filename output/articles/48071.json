{"title":"Wave–particle duality","summary":"Wave–particle duality is the concept in quantum mechanics  that every particle or quantum entity may be described as either a particle or a wave. It expresses the inability of the classical concepts \"particle\" or \"wave\" to fully describe the behaviour of quantum-scale objects.
