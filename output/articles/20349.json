{"title":"Hindu atheism","summary":"Atheism (Sanskrit: निरीश्वरवाद, nir-īśvara-vāda, lit. \"Disbelief in Ishvara\") has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the Astika (Orthodox) streams of Hindu philosophy.[1] Hindu spiritual atheists who affirms vedas and brahman or those who follow astika (orthodox) philosophies but reject personal god(s) are also called dharmic atheist or sanatani atheist.[2] In current Indian languages Hindi or bengali, āstika and its derivatives usually mean 'theist', and nāstika and its derivatives denote an 'atheist'; however, the two terms in ancient- and medieval-era Sanskrit literature do not refer to 'theism' or 'atheism'.[3] In ancient India Astika means those who affirms vedas, atman and brahman while nastika   by contrast, are those who deny all the respective definitions of āstika; they do not believe in the existence of Self or ishvara and rejects vedas.[4] Sometimes nastika philosophies are also considered as a part of hindu philosophy because the word 'Hindu' is also an exonym and historically, the term has also been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people living in the Indian subcontinent.[5] While majority scholars consider only the astika philosophies as hindu philosophy because the word 'Hindu' became a religious identity now.[6]","image":"Om_symbol.svg.png.webp","url":"Hindu_atheism"}
