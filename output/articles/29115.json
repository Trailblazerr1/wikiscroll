{"title":"Measurement in quantum mechanics","summary":"In quantum physics, a measurement is the testing or manipulation of a physical system to yield a numerical result. The predictions that quantum physics makes are in general probabilistic. The mathematical tools for making predictions about what measurement outcomes may occur were developed during the 20th century and make use of linear algebra and functional analysis.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics"}
