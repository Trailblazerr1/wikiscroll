{"title":"List of awards and nominations received by Holby City","summary":"Holby City is a British medical drama television series that has been broadcast on BBC One since 12 January 1999.[1] The series was created by Tony McHale and Mal Young as a spin-off from the BBC medical drama Casualty, which is set in the emergency department of the fictional Holby City Hospital, based in the equally fictitious town of Holby.[2][3] Young wanted to explore what happened to patients treated in Casualty once they were taken away to the hospital's surgical wards.[4] He opined that Casualty limited itself to \"accident of the week\" storylines, while Holby City allowed the possibility of storylines about long-term care, rather than immediate life-and-death decisions.[5]","image":"Holby_City_Hospital.jpg.webp"}
