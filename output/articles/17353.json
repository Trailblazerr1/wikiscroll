{"title":"Gallipoli campaign","summary":"The Gallipoli campaign[lower-alpha 1] was a military campaign in the First World War that took place on the Gallipoli peninsula (Gelibolu in modern Turkey), from 17 February 1915 to 9 January 1916. The Entente powers, Britain, France and Russia, sought to weaken the Ottoman Empire, one of the Central Powers, by taking control of the Turkish straits. This would expose the Ottoman capital at Constantinople to bombardment by Allied battleships and cut it off from the Asian part of the empire. With Turkey defeated, the Suez canal would be safe, and a year-round Allied supply route could be opened through the Black Sea to warm water ports in Russia.","image":"G.C._18_March_1915_Gallipoli_Campaign_Article.jpg.webp","url":"Gallipoli_campaign"}
