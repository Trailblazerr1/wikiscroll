{"title":"Hyderabadi haleem","summary":"Hyderabadi haleem (/ˈhaɪdərəbɑːdiː həˈliːm/) is a type of haleem popular in the Indian city of Hyderabad.[2][3] Haleem is a stew composed of meat, lentils and pounded wheat made into a thick paste. It is originally an Arabic dish and was introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the rule of the Nizams (the former rulers of Hyderabad State). Local traditional spices helped a unique Hyderabadi haleem evolve,[4] which became popular among the native Hyderabadis by the 19th century.","image":"Hyderabadi_Mutton_Haleem.jpg.webp","url":"Hyderabadi_haleem"}
