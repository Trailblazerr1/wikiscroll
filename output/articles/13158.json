{"title":"Dispensationalism","summary":"Dispensationalism is a hermeneutic system for the Bible. It considers biblical history as divided by God into dispensations, defined periods or ages to which God has allotted distinctive administrative principles. According to dispensationalism, each age of God's plan is thus administered in a certain way, and humanity is held responsible as a steward during that time. Dispensationalists' presuppositions start with the inductive reasoning that biblical history has a particular discontinuity in the way God reacts to humanity in the unfolding of their, sometimes supposed, free wills.[1]","image":"History_of_Dispensationalism.png.webp","url":"Dispensationalism"}
