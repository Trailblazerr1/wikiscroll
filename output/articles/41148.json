{"title":"Social psychology (sociology)","summary":"In sociology, social psychology (also known as sociological social psychology) studies the relationship between the individual and society.[1] Although studying many of the same substantive topics as its counterpart in the field of psychology, sociological social psychology places relatively more emphasis on the influence of social structure and culture on individual outcomes, such as personality, behavior, and one's position in social hierarchies. Researchers broadly focus on higher levels of analysis, directing attention mainly to groups and the arrangement of relationships among people. This subfield of sociology is broadly recognized as having three major perspectives: Symbolic interactionism, social structure and personality, and structural social psychology.[1]","image":"Department_of_Social_Psychology%2C_1970_(3926526622).jpg.webp","url":"Social_psychology_(sociology)"}
