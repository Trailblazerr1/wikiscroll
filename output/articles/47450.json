{"title":"Vince Carter","summary":"Vincent Lamar Carter Jr. (born January 26, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player and current basketball analyst for ESPN. He primarily played the shooting guard and small forward positions, but occasionally played power forward later in his NBA career. Carter was an eight-time All-Star and a two-time All-NBA Team selection. He is the only player in NBA history to play 22 seasons and in four different decades from his debut in 1999 to his retirement in 2020.[1] Considered by some of his peers as basketball's most talented player ever,[2] Carter entertained crowds with his leaping ability and slam dunks, earning nicknames such as \"Vinsanity\", \"Air Canada\", and \"Half Man, Half Amazing\". He has been ranked as the greatest dunker of all-time by numerous players, journalists, and by the National Basketball Association (NBA).[3][4][5][6] In addition to his dunking prowess, Carter was also a prolific three-point shooter, having made the sixth most three-point field goals in league history at the time of his retirement.[7]","image":"Vince_Carter_2013-03-25_(1).jpg.webp"}
