{"title":"Redlining","summary":"In the United States, redlining was a discriminatory practice in which services (financial and otherwise) were withheld from potential customers who resided in neighborhoods classified as 'hazardous' to investment; these residents largely belonged to racial and ethnic minorities. While the most well-known examples involved denial of credit and insurance, denial of healthcare and the development of food deserts in minority neighborhoods have also been attributed to redlining in many instances.[2][3] In the case of retail businesses like supermarkets, the purposeful construction of stores impractically far away from targeted residents resulted in a redlining effect.[3]","image":"Home_Owners'_Loan_Corporation_Philadelphia_redlining_map.jpg.webp"}
