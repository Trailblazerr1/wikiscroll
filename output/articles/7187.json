{"title":"Bone fracture","summary":"A bone fracture  (abbreviated FRX or Fx, Fx, or #) is a medical condition in which there is a partial or complete break in the continuity of a bone. In more severe cases, the bone may be broken into several pieces.[1] A bone fracture may be the result of high force impact or stress, or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture.[2]","image":"Broken_fixed_arm.jpg.webp"}
