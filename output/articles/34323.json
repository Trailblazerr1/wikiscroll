{"title":"Pelasgians","summary":"The name Pelasgians (Ancient Greek: Πελασγοί, Pelasgoí, singular: Πελασγός, Pelasgós) was used by classical Greek writers to refer either to the ancestors of the Greeks,[1][2] or to all the inhabitants of Greece before the emergence or arrival of the Greeks. In general, \"Pelasgian\" has come to mean more broadly all the indigenous inhabitants of the Aegean Sea region and their cultures, \"a hold-all term for any ancient, primitive and presumably indigenous people in the Greek world\".[3]","image":"Map_of_Greece%2C_Archipelago_and_part_of_Anadoli%3B_Louis_Stanislas_d'Arcy_Delarochette_1791.jpg.webp","url":"Pelasgians"}
