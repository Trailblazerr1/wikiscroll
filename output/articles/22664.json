{"title":"Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)","summary":"Ivy Bridge is the codename for Intel's 22 nm microarchitecture used in the third generation of the Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3). Ivy Bridge is a die shrink to 22 nm process based on FinFET (\"3D\") Tri-Gate transistors, from the former generation's 32 nm Sandy Bridge microarchitecture—also known as tick–tock model. The name is also applied more broadly to the Xeon and Core i7 Ivy Bridge-E series of processors released in 2013.","image":"Ivy_Bridge_Codename_Logo.jpg.webp","url":"Ivy_Bridge_(microarchitecture)"}
