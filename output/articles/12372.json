{"title":"Debate","summary":"Debate is a process that involves formal discourse on a particular topic, often including a moderator and audience. In a debate, arguments are put forward for often opposing viewpoints. Debates have historically occurred in public meetings, academic institutions, debate halls, coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies.[1] Debate has also been conducted for educational and recreational purposes,[2] usually associated with educational establishments and debating societies.[3] These debates put an emphasis upon logical consistency, factual accuracy, and some emotional appeal to an audience.  Modern forms of competitive debate also include rules for participants to discuss and decide upon the framework of the debate (how the debate will be judged).","image":"Petrus_alphonsi_dialogues.jpg.webp","url":"Debate"}
