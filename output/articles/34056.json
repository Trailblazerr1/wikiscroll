{"title":"Passive voice","summary":"A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages.[1] In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the theme or patient of the main verb â€“ that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed.[2] This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role. For example, in the passive sentence \"The tree was pulled down\", the subject (the tree) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action. In contrast, the sentences \"Someone pulled down the tree\" and \"The tree is down\" are active sentences.","image":"Globe_of_letters.svg.png.webp","url":"Passive_voice"}
