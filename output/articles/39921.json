{"title":"Sega v. Accolade","summary":"Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510 (9th Cir. 1992), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit applied American intellectual property law to the reverse engineering of computer software.  Stemming from the publishing of several Sega Genesis games by video game publisher Accolade, which had disassembled Genesis software in order to publish games without being licensed by Sega, the case involved several overlapping issues, including the scope of copyright, permissible uses for trademarks, and the scope of the fair use doctrine for computer code.[2]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit.svg.png.webp","url":"Sega_v._Accolade"}
