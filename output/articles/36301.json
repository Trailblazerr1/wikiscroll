{"title":"Protein Data Bank","summary":"The Protein Data Bank (PDB)[1] is a database for the three-dimensional structural data of large biological molecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids. The data, typically obtained by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, or, increasingly, cryo-electron microscopy, and submitted by biologists and biochemists from around the world, are freely accessible on the Internet via the websites of its member organisations (PDBe,[2] PDBj,[3] RCSB,[4] and BMRB[5]). The PDB is overseen by an organization called the Worldwide Protein Data Bank, wwPDB.","image":"Wwpdb-logo.png.webp","url":"Protein_Data_Bank"}
