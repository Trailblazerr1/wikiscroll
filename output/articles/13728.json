{"title":"Due process","summary":"Due process is the legal requirement that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
