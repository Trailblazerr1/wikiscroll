{"title":"Dalton (unit)","summary":"The dalton or unified atomic mass unit (symbols: Da or u) is a unit of mass widely used in physics and chemistry. It is defined as 1⁄12 of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest.[1][2] The atomic mass constant, denoted mu  is defined identically, giving mu = m(12C)/12 = 1 Da.[3] A unit dalton is also approximately numerically equal to the molar mass of the same expressed in grams per mole (NA Da ≈ 1 g/mol). Prior to the  2019 redefinition of the SI base units these were numerically identical by definition (NA Da = 1 g/mol) and are still treated as such for most purposes.","image":"Jean_Perrin_1926.jpg.webp","url":"Dalton_(unit)"}
