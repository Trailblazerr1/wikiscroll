{"title":"Cast iron","summary":"Cast iron is a group of iron–carbon alloys with a carbon content more than 2%.[1] Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature. The alloy constituents affect its colour when fractured: white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through, grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the material breaks, and ductile cast iron has spherical graphite \"nodules\" which stop the crack from further progressing.","image":"Père-Lachaise%2C_The_bat_(10153312114).jpg.webp","url":"Cast_iron"}
