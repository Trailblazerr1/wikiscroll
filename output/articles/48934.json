{"title":"World War I reparations","summary":"Following the ratification of article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles at the conclusion of World War I, the Central Powers were compelled to give war reparations to the Allied Powers. Each of the defeated powers were required to make payments in either cash or kind. Because of the financial situation in Austria, Hungary, and Turkey after the war, few to no reparations were paid and the requirements for reparations were cancelled. Bulgaria, having paid only a fraction of what was required, saw its reparation figure reduced and then cancelled. Historians have recognized the German requirement to pay reparations as the \"chief battleground of the post-war era\" and \"the focus of the power struggle between France and Germany over whether the Versailles Treaty was to be enforced or revised.\"[1]","image":"lossy-page1-220px-A_view_of_the_ruins_of_Avocourt%2C_situated_just_behind_the_American_trenches_before_the_Allied_drive_of_September_26..._-_NARA_-_530763.tif.jpg.webp","url":"World_War_I_reparations"}
