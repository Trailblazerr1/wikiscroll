{"title":"Heterodontosaurus","summary":"Heterodontosaurus is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic, 200â€“190 million years ago. Its only known member species, Heterodontosaurus tucki, was named in 1962 based on a skull discovered in South Africa. The genus name means \"different toothed lizard\", in reference to its unusual, heterodont dentition; the specific name honours G. C. Tuck, who supported the discoverers. Further specimens have since been found, including an almost complete skeleton in 1966.","image":"Heterodontosaurus_tucki_cast_-_University_of_California_Museum_of_Paleontology_-_Berkeley%2C_CA_-_DSC04696.JPG.webp","url":"Heterodontosaurus"}
