{"title":"Estates General (France)","summary":"In France under the Ancien Régime, the Estates General (French: États généraux [eta ʒeneʁo]) or States-General was a legislative and consultative assembly of the different classes (or estates) of French subjects. It had a separate assembly for each of the three estates (clergy, nobility and commoners), which were called and dismissed by the king. It had no true power in its own right as, unlike the English parliament, it was not required to approve royal taxation or legislation.[1] It served as an advisory body to the king, primarily by presenting petitions from the various estates and consulting on fiscal policy.[2]","image":"Estatesgeneral.jpg.webp"}
