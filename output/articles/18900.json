{"title":"Green's theorem","summary":"In vector calculus, Green's theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve C to a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C. It is the two-dimensional special case of Stokes' theorem.","image":"OintctrclockwiseLaTeX.svg.png.webp","url":"Green's_theorem"}
