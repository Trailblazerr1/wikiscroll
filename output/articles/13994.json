{"title":"East Asian cultural sphere","summary":"The East Asian cultural sphere, also known as the Sinosphere, the Sinic world, the Sinitic world, the Chinese cultural sphere or the Chinese character sphere, encompasses countries in East and Southeast Asia that were historically influenced by Chinese culture. According to academic consensus, the East Asian cultural sphere is made up of four entities: Greater China (including China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan), Japan, Korea (both North Korea and South Korea), and Vietnam. Other definitions sometimes include other countries such as Mongolia[1][2][3] and Singapore, because of limited historical Chinese influences or increasing modern-day Chinese diaspora.[4] The East Asian cultural sphere is not to be confused with Greater China or the Sinophone, which includes countries where the Chinese-speaking population is dominant.[5]","image":"East_Asian_Cultural_Sphere.svg.png.webp","url":"East_Asian_cultural_sphere"}
