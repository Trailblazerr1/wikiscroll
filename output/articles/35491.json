{"title":"Poodle Hat","summary":"Poodle Hat is the eleventh studio album by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, released on May 20, 2003. It was the fifth studio album self-produced by Yankovic. The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop of the early-2000s. The album's lead single, \"Couch Potato\", is a parody of \"Lose Yourself\" by Eminem. The single failed to chart, although the album's song \"eBay\" (a parody of \"I Want It That Way\" by Backstreet Boys) eventually peaked at 15 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in 2007.","image":"Weirdalpoodlehat.jpeg.webp"}
