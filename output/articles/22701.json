Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since 1975 to a player, coach, or staff member who shows \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[1] The award is named in honor of James Walter Kennedy, the second commissioner (then president)[lower-alpha 1] of the NBA.[3] The winner is selected by the Pro Basketball Writers Association (PBWA). The PBWA represents writers for newspapers, magazines and internet services who cover the NBA on a regular basis. Members of the PBWA nominate players for the award, and then a vote is taken by approximately 150 PBWA members. The person with the highest point total wins the award.[3] The award is usually given to a person who made a substantial charitable contribution. For instance, Kevin Garnett received the award in 2006 after donating $1.2 million toward the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.[4]","image":"Lipofsky-Dikembe_Mutombo.jpg.webp"}
