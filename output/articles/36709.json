{"title":"Quantum harmonic oscillator","summary":"The quantum harmonic oscillator is the quantum-mechanical analog of the classical harmonic oscillator. Because an arbitrary smooth potential can usually be approximated as a harmonic potential at the vicinity of a stable equilibrium point,  it is one of the most important model systems in quantum mechanics. Furthermore, it is one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, analytical solution is known.[1][2][3]","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg"}
