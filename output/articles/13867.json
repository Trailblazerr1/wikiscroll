{"title":"Dystopia","summary":"A dystopia (from Ancient Greek δυσ- \"bad, hard\" and τόπος \"place\"; alternatively cacotopia[2] or simply anti-utopia) is a speculated community or society that is undesirable or frightening.[3][4] It is often treated as an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work, published in 1516, which created a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty. The relationship between utopia and dystopia is in actuality not one simple opposition, as many utopian elements and components are found in dystopias as well, and vice versa.[5][6][7]","image":"Kowloon_Walled_City.jpg.webp","url":"Dystopia"}
