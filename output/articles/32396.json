{"title":"North Yemen Civil War","summary":"The North Yemen Civil War (Arabic: ثورة 26 سبتمبر‎, romanized: Thawra 26 Sabtambar, lit. '26 September Revolution') was fought in North Yemen from 1962 to 1970 between partisans of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom and supporters of the Yemen Arab Republic. The war began with a coup d'état carried out in 1962 by revolutionary republicans led by the army under the command of Abdullah as-Sallal, who dethroned the newly crowned Imam Muhammad al-Badr and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the Saudi Arabian border where he rallied popular support from northern Shia tribes to retake power, escalating rapidly to a full-scale civil war.","image":"North_Yemen_Civil_War.jpg.webp"}
