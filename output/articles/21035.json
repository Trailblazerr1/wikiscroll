It is also the principal organ in the olfactory system.  The shape of the nose is determined by the nasal bones and the nasal cartilages, including the nasal septum which separates the nostrils and divides the nasal cavity into two. On average the nose of a male is larger than that of a female.","image":"Fort_Ross_Elena_wearing_Traditional_Russian_Costume_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
