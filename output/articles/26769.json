{"title":"List of chief ministers of Karnataka","summary":"The Chief Minister of Karnataka is the chief executive of the Indian state of Karnataka.  As per the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government in the state. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.[1]","image":"Seal_of_Karnataka.svg.png.webp"}
