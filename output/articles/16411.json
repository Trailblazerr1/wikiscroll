{"title":"Flag of the Philippines","summary":"The national flag of the Philippines (Filipino: pambansang watawat ng Pilipinas) is a horizontal bicolor flag with equal bands of royal blue and crimson red, with a white, equilateral triangle at the hoist. In the center of the triangle is a golden-yellow sun with eight primary rays, each representing a province.[lower-alpha 1] At each vertex of the triangle is a five-pointed, golden-yellow star, each of which representing one of the country's three main island groupsâ€”Luzon, the Visayas (though originally referring to the island of Panay)[lower-alpha 2] and Mindanao. The white triangle at the flag represents liberty, equality, and fraternity. A unique feature of this flag is its usage to indicate a state of war if it is displayed with the red side on top, which is effectively achieved by flipping the flag upside-down.[17]","image":"Flag_of_the_Philippines.svg.png.webp"}
