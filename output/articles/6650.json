{"title":"Biodiversity loss","summary":"Biodiversity loss includes the worldwide extinction of different species, as well as the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat, resulting in a loss of biological diversity. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration/ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). The current global extinction (frequently called the sixth mass extinction or Anthropocene extinction), has resulted in a biodiversity crisis being driven by human activities which push beyond the planetary boundaries and so far has proven irreversible.[1][2]","image":"Summary_of_major_environmental-change_categories_expressed_as_a_percentage_change_(red)_relative_to_baseline_-_fcosc-01-615419-g001.jpg.webp","url":"Biodiversity_loss"}
