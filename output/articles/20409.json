{"title":"Histories (Herodotus)","summary":"The Histories (Greek: Ἱστορίαι ; Ancient Greek: [historíai̯]; also known as The History[1]) of Herodotus is considered the founding work of history in Western literature.[2] Written in 430 BC in the Ionic dialect of classical Greek, The Histories serves as a record of the ancient traditions, politics, geography, and clashes of various cultures that were known in Greece, Western Asia and Northern Africa at that time. Although not a fully impartial record, it remains one of the West's most important sources regarding these affairs. Moreover, it established the genre and study of history in the Western world (despite the existence of historical records and chronicles beforehand).","image":"POxy_v0017_n2099_a_01_hires.jpg.webp","url":"Histories_(Herodotus)"}
