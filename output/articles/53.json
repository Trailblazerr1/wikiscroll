{"title":"1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane","summary":"1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (also known as norflurane (INN), R-134a, Freon 134a, Forane 134a, Genetron 134a, Green Gas, Florasol 134a, Suva 134a, or HFC-134a) is a hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) and haloalkane refrigerant with thermodynamic properties similar to R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) but with insignificant ozone depletion potential and a lower 100-year global warming potential (1,430, compared to R-12's GWP of 10,900).[2] It has the formula CF3CH2F and a boiling point of −26.3 °C (−15.34 °F) at atmospheric pressure.  R-134a cylinders are colored light blue.[3]  A phaseout and transition to HFO-1234yf and other refrigerants, with GWPs similar to CO2, began in 2012 within the automotive market.[4]","image":"1%2C1%2C1%2C2-Tetrafluoroethane.svg.png.webp","url":"1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane"}
