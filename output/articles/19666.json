{"title":"Harpoon","summary":"A harpoon is a long spear-like instrument and tool used in fishing, whaling, sealing, and other marine hunting to catch large fish or marine mammals such as whales. It accomplishes this task by impaling the target animal and securing it with barb or toggling claws, allowing the fishermen to use a rope or chain attached to the projectile to catch the animal. A harpoon can also be used as a weapon. Certain harpoons are made with different builds to perform better with the type of target being aimed at: the Inuit for example have short, fixed foreshaft harpoons for hunting at breathing holes while loose shafted ones are made for attaching to the game thrown at.[1]","image":"Inuit_hunter_with_harpoon.jpg.webp","url":"Harpoon"}
