{"title":"Mineral (nutrient)","summary":"In the context of nutrition, a mineral is a chemical element required as an essential nutrient by  organisms to perform functions necessary for life.[1][2][3] However, the four major structural elements in the human body by weight (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen), are usually not included in lists of major nutrient minerals (nitrogen is considered a \"mineral\" for plants, as it often is included in fertilizers). These four elements compose about 96% of the weight of the human body, and major minerals (macrominerals) and minor minerals (also called trace elements) compose the remainder.","image":"Blood_values_sorted_by_mass_and_molar_concentration.png.webp"}
