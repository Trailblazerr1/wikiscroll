{"title":"Charon's obol","summary":"Charon's obol is an allusive term for the coin placed in or on the mouth[1] of a dead person before burial. Greek and Latin literary sources specify the coin as an obol, and explain it as a payment or bribe for Charon, the ferryman who conveyed souls across the river that divided the world of the living from the world of the dead. Archaeological examples of these coins, of various denominations in practice, have been called \"the most famous grave goods from antiquity.\"[2]","image":"Charon_and_Psyche.jpg.webp"}
