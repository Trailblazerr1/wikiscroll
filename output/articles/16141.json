{"title":"Filibuster","summary":"A filibuster is a political procedure where one or more members of a Congress or Parliament debate over a proposed piece of legislation so as to delay or entirely prevent a decision being made on the proposal. It is sometimes referred to as \"talking a bill to death\" or \"talking out a bill\"[1] and is characterized as a form of obstruction in a legislature or other decision-making body. This form of political obstruction reaches as far back as Ancient Roman times and is synonymous with political stonewalling.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Filibuster"}
