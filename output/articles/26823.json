{"title":"List of deaths at the Berlin Wall","summary":"There were numerous deaths at the Berlin Wall, which stood as a barrier between West Berlin and East Berlin from 13 August 1961 until 9 November 1989.  Before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin. From there they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the Wall prevented almost all such emigration.[1]","image":"Gedenktafel_Ebertstr_ggü_25_(Tierg)_Maueropfer.JPG.webp"}
