{"title":"Abraham in Islam","summary":"According to the Islamic faith, Abraham (Arabic: إِبْرَاهِيْمُ‎, romanized: ʾIbrāhīm pronounced [ʔɪbraːˈhiːm]) was a prophet and messenger[1][2] of God, and an ancestor to the Ishmaelite Arabs and Israelites.[1][3]Abraham plays a prominent role as an example of faith in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[1] In Muslim belief, Ibrahim fulfilled all the commandments and trials wherein God nurtured him throughout his lifetime. As a result of his unwavering faith in Allah, Ibrahim was promised by Allah to be a leader to all the nations of the world.[4] The Quran extols Ibrahim as a model, an exemplar, obedient and not an idolater.[5] In this sense, Abraham has been described as representing \"primordial man in universal surrender to the Divine Reality before its fragmentation into religions separated from each other by differences in form\".[6]: 18  Muslims believe that the Kaaba in Mecca was built by Abraham and his son Ishmael as the first house of worship on earth. The Islamic holy day 'Eid ul-Adha is celebrated in commemoration of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son on God's command, as well as the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to the Kaaba.[6]","image":"Ibrahim_(Abraham)1.png.webp","url":"Abraham_in_Islam"}
