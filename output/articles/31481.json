{"title":"Natural selection","summary":"Natural selection is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in phenotype. It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in the heritable traits characteristic of a population over generations. Charles Darwin popularised the term \"natural selection\", contrasting it with artificial selection, which in his view is intentional, whereas natural selection is not.","image":"Charles_Darwin_aged_51.jpg.webp","url":"Natural_selection"}
