{"title":"Cornish people","summary":"The Cornish people or Cornish (Cornish: Kernowyon, Old English: Cornƿīelisċ) are a Celtic[18] ethnic group and nation native to, or associated with Cornwall[19][20] and a recognised national minority in the United Kingdom,[21] which can trace its roots to the ancient Britons who inhabited southern and central Great Britain before the Roman conquest.[22] Many in Cornwall today continue to assert a distinct identity separate from or in addition to English or British identities. Cornish identity has been adopted by migrants into Cornwall, as well as by emigrant and descendant communities from Cornwall, the latter sometimes referred to as the Cornish diaspora.[10] Although not included as an explicit option in the UK census, the numbers of those claiming Cornish ethnic and national identity are officially recognised and recorded.[23][24]","image":"Flag_of_Cornwall.svg.png.webp"}
