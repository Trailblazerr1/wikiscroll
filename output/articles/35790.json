{"title":"Pratītyasamutpāda","summary":"Pratītyasamutpāda (Sanskrit, Pāli: paṭiccasamuppāda), commonly translated as dependent origination, or dependent arising, is a key doctrine in Buddhism shared by all schools of Buddhism.[1][note 1] It states that all dharmas (phenomena) arise in dependence upon other dharmas: \"if this exists, that exists; if this ceases to exist, that also ceases to exist\". The basic principle is that all things (dharmas, phenomena, principles) arise in dependence upon other things.","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp","url":"Pratītyasamutpāda"}
