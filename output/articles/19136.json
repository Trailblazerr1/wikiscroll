{"title":"Guinevere","summary":"Guinevere (/ˈɡwɪnɪvɪər/ (listen) GWIN-iv-eer; Welsh: Gwenhwyfar pronunciation ; Breton: Gwenivar, Cornish: Gwynnever), also often written as Guenevere or Guenever,[1] is the legendary queen and wife of King Arthur. First recorded in literature by the early 12th century, nearly 700 years after the purported times of Arthur, Guinevere has been portrayed as everything from a villainous and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous lady. A notably recurring theme in many Arthurian tales is that of her abduction.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
