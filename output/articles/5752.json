{"title":"Batik","summary":"Batik[n 1] is a technique of wax-resist dyeing applied to the whole cloth.[1][2][3] This technique originated from the island of Java, Indonesia.[4] Batik is made either by drawing dots and lines of the resist with a spouted tool called a canting,[n 2] or by printing the resist with a copper stamp called a cap.[n 3][5] The applied wax resists dyes and therefore allows the artisan to colour selectively by soaking the cloth in one colour, removing the wax with boiling water, and repeating if multiple colours are desired.[4]","image":"Batik_pedalaman_-_sidha_drajat.JPG.webp"}
