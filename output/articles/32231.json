{"title":"Noble metal","summary":"In chemistry, noble metals are metallic elements that show outstanding resistance to chemical attack even at high temperatures.[8] They are well known for their catalytic properties and associated capacity to facilitate or control the rates of chemical reactions.[8] The short list of chemically noble metals (those elements upon which almost all chemists agree) comprises ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt), gold (Au) and silver (Ag).[9] In periodic table terms, an analogy can be made between the noble metals and the noble gases, which are mainly unreactive.[10]","image":"PT_extract_noble_metals.jpg.webp"}
