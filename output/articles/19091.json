{"title":"Guangzhou","summary":"Guangzhou (UK: /ɡwæŋˈdʒoʊ/,[5] US: /ɡwɒŋ-/;[6] simplified Chinese: 广州; traditional Chinese: 廣州; pinyin: Guǎngzhōu; Cantonese pronunciation: [kʷɔ̌ːŋ.tsɐ̂u] or [kʷɔ̌ːŋ.tsɐ́u] (listen); Mandarin pronunciation: [kwàŋ tʂóu] (listen)), also known as Canton /kænˈtɒn/[7] and alternately romanized as Kwongchow or Kwangchow,[8] is the capital and the largest city of Guangdong province in southern China.[9] Located on the Pearl River about 120 km (75 mi) north-northwest of Hong Kong and 145 km (90 mi) north of Macau, Guangzhou has a history of over 2,200 years and was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road,[10] and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub, as well as one of China's three largest cities.[11] Long the only Chinese port accessible to  most foreign traders, Guangzhou was captured by the British during the First Opium War. No longer enjoying a monopoly after the war, it lost trade to other ports such as Hong Kong and Shanghai, but continued to serve as a major transshipment port. Due to a high urban population and large volumes of port traffic, Guangzhou is classified as a Large-Port Megacity, the largest type of port-city in the world.[12]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
