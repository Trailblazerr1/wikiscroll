{"title":"Sephardi Jews","summary":"Sephardi Jews, also known as Sephardic Jews, Sephardim,[lower-alpha 1] or Hispanic Jews by modern scholars,[2] are a Jewish ethnic division originating from traditionally established communities in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal). The term \"Sephardim\" also sometimes refers to Mizrahi Jews (Eastern Jewish communities) of Western Asia and North Africa. Although the millennia-long established latter groups did not originally have ancestry from the Jewish communities of Iberia, the majority of them were influenced by the Sephardic style of liturgy and Sephardic law and customs from the influence of Moshe ben Maimon, and then later many Iberian Jewish exiles sought refuge in those pre-existing Jewish communities over the course of the last few centuries, resulting in a conflation of terms. This article deals with Sephardim proper within the narrower ethnic definition.","image":"Flag_of_Israel.svg.png.webp","url":"Sephardi_Jews"}
