{"title":"Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis","summary":"Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis, KG, PC (31 December 1738 â€“ 5 October 1805), styled Viscount Brome between 1753 and 1762 and known as the Earl Cornwallis between 1762 and 1792, was a British Army general and official. In the United States and the United Kingdom he is best remembered as one of the leading British generals in the American War of Independence. His surrender in 1781 to a combined American and French force at the siege of Yorktown ended significant hostilities in North America. He later served as a civil and military governor in Ireland, where he helped bring about the Act of Union; and in India, where he helped enact the Cornwallis Code and the Permanent Settlement.","image":"First_Marquis_of_Cornwallis.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis"}
