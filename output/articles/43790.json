{"title":"Tetanurae","summary":"Tetanurae (/ˌtɛtəˈnjuːriː/ or \"stiff tails\") is a clade that includes most theropod dinosaurs, including megalosauroids, allosauroids, tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, maniraptorans, compsognathids and birds.[5] Tetanurans are defined as all theropods more closely related to modern birds than to Ceratosaurus and contain the majority of predatory dinosaur diversity.[6] Tetanurae likely diverged from its sister group, Ceratosauria, during the late Triassic.[7] Tetanurae first appeared in the fossil record by the Early Jurassic about 190 mya and by the Middle Jurassic had become globally distributed.[6]","image":"Monolophosaurus_jiangi.jpg.webp","url":"Tetanurae"}
