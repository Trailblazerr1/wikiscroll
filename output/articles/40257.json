{"title":"Shale","summary":"Shale is a fine-grained, clastic sedimentary rock formed from mud that is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite.[1]  Shale is characterized by its tendency to split into thin layers (laminae) less than one centimeter in thickness. This property is called fissility.[1] Shale is the most common sedimentary rock.[2]","image":"Chattanooga_Shale_(Upper_Devonian%3B_Burkesville_West_Rt._90_roadcut%2C_Kentucky%2C_USA)_25_(40541681100).jpg.webp","url":"Shale"}
