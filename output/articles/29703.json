{"title":"Michael the Brave","summary":"Michael the Brave (Romanian: Mihai Viteazul [miˈhaj viˈte̯azul] or Mihai Bravu [ˈbravu]; 1558 – 9 August 1601) was the Prince of Wallachia (as Michael II, 1593–1601), Prince of Moldavia (1600) and de facto ruler of Transylvania (1599–1600). He is considered one of Romania's greatest national heroes.[2] Since the 19th century, Michael the Brave has been regarded by Romanian nationalists as a symbol of Romanian unity,[3] as his reign marked the first time all principalities inhabited by Romanians were under the same ruler.[4]","image":"MihaiViteazul.jpg.webp"}
