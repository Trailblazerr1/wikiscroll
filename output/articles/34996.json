{"title":"Pilgrim","summary":"A pilgrim (from the Latin peregrinus) is a traveler (literally one who has come from afar) who is on a journey to a holy place. Typically, this is a physical journey (often on foot) to some place of special significance to the adherent of a particular religious belief system. In the spiritual literature of Christianity, the concept of pilgrim and pilgrimage may refer to the experience of life in the world (considered as a period of exile) or to the inner path of the spiritual aspirant from a state of wretchedness to a state of beatitude.[1]","image":"Jan_van_Scorel_-_Five_Members_of_the_Utrecht_Brotherhood_of_Jerusalem_Pilgrims_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp","url":"Pilgrim"}
