{"title":"Governor General of Canada","summary":"The governor general of Canada (French: gouverneure générale du Canada)[n 1] is the federal viceregal representative of the Canadian monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II. The person of the Queen is shared equally with the 14 other Commonwealth realms, but she physically resides predominantly in her oldest and most populous realm, the United Kingdom. The Queen, on the advice of her Canadian prime minister,[1] appoints a governor general to carry on the Government of Canada in her own right, and, as ex officio viceroy, most of her constitutional and ceremonial duties, that is, the royal prerogative. The commission is for an unfixed period of time—known as serving at Her Majesty's pleasure—though five years is the normal convention. Since 1959, it has also been traditional to alternate between anglophone and francophone officeholders—although many recent governors general have been bilingual. Once in office, the governor general maintains direct contact with the Queen, wherever she may be at the time.[2]","image":"Badge_of_the_Governor-General_of_Canada.svg.png.webp"}
