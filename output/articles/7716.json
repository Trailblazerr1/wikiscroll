{"title":"Brouwer fixed-point theorem","summary":"Brouwer's fixed-point theorem is a fixed-point theorem in topology, named after L. E. J. (Bertus) Brouwer. It states that for any continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n mapping a compact convex set to itself there is a point \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{0}}\n  \n such that \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        \n          x\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x_{0})=x_{0}}\n  \n. The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n from a closed interval \n  \n    \n      \n        I\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I}\n  \n in the real numbers to itself or from a closed disk \n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n  \n to itself. A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a convex compact subset \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n  \n of Euclidean space to itself.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg"}
