{"title":"Benzodiazepine dependence","summary":"Benzodiazepine dependence defines a situation in which one has developed one or more of either tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, drug seeking behaviors, such as continued use despite harmful effects, and maladaptive pattern of substance use, according to the DSM-IV. In the case of benzodiazepine dependence, however, the continued use seems to be associated with the avoidance of unpleasant withdrawal reaction rather than from the pleasurable effects of the drug.[1] Benzodiazepine dependence develops with long-term use, even at low therapeutic doses,[2] without the described dependence behavior.[3]","image":"Benzodiazepine_a.svg.png.webp","url":"Benzodiazepine_dependence"}
