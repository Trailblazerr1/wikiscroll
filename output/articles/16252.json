{"title":"First-person narrative","summary":"A first-person narrative is a mode of storytelling in which a storyteller recounts events from their own point of view using the first person  such as \"I\", \"us\", \"our\" and \"ourselves\". [1][2] It may be narrated by a first-person protagonist (or other focal character), first-person re-teller, first-person witness,[3] or first-person peripheral.[4][5] A classic example of a first-person protagonist narrator is Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre (1847),[1] in which the title character is also the narrator telling her own story,[6] \"I could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to notice me\".[7]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"First-person_narrative"}
