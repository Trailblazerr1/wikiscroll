{"title":"Machine Gun Kelly","summary":"George Kelly Barnes (July 18, 1895 â€“ July 18, 1954),[1] better known by his pseudonym \"Machine Gun Kelly\", was an American gangster from Memphis, Tennessee, active during the Prohibition era. His nickname came from his favorite weapon, a Thompson submachine gun. He is best known for the kidnapping of the oil tycoon and businessman Charles F. Urschel in July 1933, from which he and his gang collected a $200,000 ransom (around $4 million as of today).[2] Urschel had collected and left considerable evidence that assisted the subsequent FBI investigation, which eventually led to Kelly's arrest in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 26, 1933.[1] His crimes also included bootlegging and armed robbery.","image":"MachineGunKelly.jpg.webp"}
