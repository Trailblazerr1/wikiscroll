{"title":"Compound steam engine","summary":"A compound steam engine unit is a type of steam engine where steam is expanded in two or more stages.[1][2]\nA typical arrangement for a compound engine is that the steam is first expanded in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder, then having given up heat and losing pressure, it exhausts directly into one or more larger-volume low-pressure (LP) cylinders. Multiple-expansion engines employ additional cylinders, of progressively lower pressure, to extract further energy from the steam.[3]","image":"Triple_expansion_engine_animation.gif"}
