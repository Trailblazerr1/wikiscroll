{"title":"Emergency bleeding control","summary":"Emergency bleeding control describes actions that control bleeding from a patient who has suffered a traumatic injury or who has a medical condition that has caused bleeding. Many bleeding control techniques are taught as part of first aid throughout the world,[1] though some more advanced techniques such as tourniquets, are often taught as being reserved for use by health professionals, or as an absolute last resort, to mitigate associated risks, such as potential loss of limbs.[2] To manage bleeding effectively, it is important to be able to readily identify types of wounds and types of bleeding.","image":"Bleeding.jpg.webp"}
