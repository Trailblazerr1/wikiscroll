{"title":"Sigurd","summary":"Sigurd (Old Norse: Sigurðr [ˈsiɣˌurðz̠]) or Siegfried (Middle High German: Sîvrit) is a legendary hero of Germanic heroic legend, who killed a dragon and was later murdered. It is possible he was inspired by one or more figures from the Frankish Merovingian dynasty, with Sigebert I being the most popular contender. Older scholarship sometimes connected him with Arminius, victor of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.[1] He may also have a purely mythological origin. Sigurd's story is first attested on a series of carvings, including runestones from Sweden and stone crosses from the British Isles, dating from the eleventh century.","image":"Siegfrieds_Tod_rechts_neben_Siegfried_steht_sein_Moerder_Hagen_mit_dem_Bogen_Hundeshagenscher_Kodex.jpeg.webp","url":"Sigurd"}
