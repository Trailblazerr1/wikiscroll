{"title":"Sinitic languages","summary":"The Sinitic languages,[lower-alpha 1] often synonymous with \"Chinese languages\", constitute the major branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. It is frequently proposed that there is a primary split between the Sinitic languages and the rest of the family (the Tibeto-Burman languages), but this view is rejected by an increasing number of researchers.[4] The Bai languages, whose classification is difficult, may be an offshoot of Old Chinese and thus Sinitic;[5] otherwise Sinitic is defined only by the many varieties of Chinese, and usage of the term \"Sinitic\" may reflect the linguistic view that Chinese constitutes a family of distinct languages, rather than variants of a single language.[lower-alpha 2]","image":"ChineseInST.svg.png.webp"}
