{"title":"Ore","summary":"Ore is natural rock or sediment that contains one or more valuable minerals, typically containing metals, that can be mined, treated and sold at a profit.[1][2] Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined, often via smelting, to extract the valuable metals or minerals.[3]\nThe grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. The value of the metals or minerals a rock contains must be weighed against the cost of extraction to determine whether it is of sufficiently high grade to be worth mining, and is therefore considered an ore.[3]","image":"Banded_iron_formation.png.webp"}
