{"title":"Asana","summary":"An asana is a body posture, originally and still a general term for a sitting meditation pose,[1] and later extended in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise, to any type of position, adding reclining, standing, inverted, twisting, and balancing poses. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali define \"asana\" as \"[a position that] is steady and comfortable\".[2] Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the eight limbs of his system.[2] Asanas are also called yoga poses or yoga postures in English.","image":"Asanas_Composite.jpg.webp","url":"Asana"}
