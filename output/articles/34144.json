{"title":"Pattern (sewing)","summary":"In sewing and fashion design, a pattern is the template from which the parts of a garment are traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. Patterns are usually made of paper, and are sometimes made of sturdier materials like paperboard or cardboard if they need to be more robust to withstand repeated use. The process of making or cutting patterns is sometimes compounded to the one-word Patternmaking, but it can also be written pattern(-)making or pattern cutting.","image":"Fashion_students_2016-15_(25792353403).jpg.webp","url":"Pattern_(sewing)"}
