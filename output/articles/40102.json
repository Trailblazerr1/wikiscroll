{"title":"Sericulture","summary":"Sericulture, or silk farming, is the cultivation of silkworms to produce silk. Although there are several commercial species of silkworms, Bombyx mori (the caterpillar of the domestic silkmoth) is the most widely used and intensively studied silkworm. Silk was believed to have first been produced in China as early as the Neolithic Period. Sericulture has become an important cottage industry in countries such as Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, and Russia.  Today, China and India are the two main producers, with more than 60% of the world's annual production.","image":"Court_ladies_pounding_silk_from_a_painting_(捣练图)_by_Emperor_Huizong.jpg.webp","url":"Sericulture"}
