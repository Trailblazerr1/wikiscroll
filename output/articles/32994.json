{"title":"One pound (British coin)","summary":"The British one pound (£1) coin is a denomination of the pound sterling. Its obverse bears the Latin engraving ELIZABETH II D G REG (\"Dei Gratia Regina\") F D (Fidei defensor) meaning, \"Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen, Defender of the Faith\".[1][2] It has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the original coin's introduction on 21 April 1983.[3] Four different portraits of the Queen have been used, with the latest design by Jody Clark being introduced in 2015. The design on the reverse side of the current, 12-sided coin features four emblems to represent each of the nations of the United Kingdom — the English rose, the leek for Wales, the Scottish thistle, and the shamrock for Northern Ireland, also two or three oak leaves — emerging from a single 5-branched stem within a crown.","image":"British_12_sided_pound_coin.png.webp"}
