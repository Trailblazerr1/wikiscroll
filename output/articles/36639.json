{"title":"Q fever","summary":"Q fever or query fever is a disease caused by infection with Coxiella burnetii,[1][3][4] a bacterium that affects humans and other animals. This organism is uncommon, but may be found in cattle, sheep, goats, and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs. The infection results from inhalation of a spore-like small-cell variant, and from contact with the milk, urine, feces, vaginal mucus, or semen of infected animals. Rarely, the disease is tick-borne.[5] The incubation period is 9–40 days. Humans are vulnerable to Q fever, and infection can result from even a few organisms.[5] The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogenic parasite.","image":"Immunohistochemical_detection_of_Coxiella_burnetii_in_resected_cardiac_valve_of_a_60-year-old_man_with_Q_fever_endocarditis.jpg.webp","url":"Q_fever"}
