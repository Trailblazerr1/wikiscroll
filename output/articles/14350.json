{"title":"Einsatzgruppen","summary":"Einsatzgruppen[lower-alpha 1] (German: [ˈaɪnzatsˌɡʁʊpn̩], lit. 'deployment groups';[1] also 'task forces')[2] were Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary death squads of Nazi Germany that were responsible for mass killings, primarily by shooting, during World War II (1939–1945) in German-occupied Europe. The Einsatzgruppen had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called \"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\" (Die Endlösung der Judenfrage) in territories conquered by Nazi Germany, and were involved in the murder of much of the intelligentsia and cultural elite of Poland, including members of the Catholic priesthood.[3] Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars, Jews, and Romani people, as well as actual or alleged partisans throughout Eastern Europe.","image":"Flag_of_the_Schutzstaffel.svg.png.webp","url":"Einsatzgruppen"}
