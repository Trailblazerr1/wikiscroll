{"title":"Sustainable living","summary":"Sustainable living describes a lifestyle[1] that attempts to reduce an individual's or society's use of the Earth's natural resources, and one's personal resources.[2] It is often called as \"earth harmony living\" or \"net zero living\". Its practitioners often attempt to reduce their ecological footprint (including their carbon footprint) by altering their methods of transportation, energy consumption, and/or diet.[3] Its proponents aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent with sustainability, naturally balanced, and respectful of humanity's symbiotic relationship with the Earth's natural ecology.[4] The practice and general philosophy of ecological living closely follows the overall principles of sustainable development.[5]","image":"Sustainable_development.svg.png.webp","url":"Sustainable_living"}
