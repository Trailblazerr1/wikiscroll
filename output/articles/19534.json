{"title":"Handcuffs","summary":"Handcuffs are restraint devices designed to secure an individual's wrists in proximity to each other.[1] They comprise two parts, linked together by a chain, a hinge, or rigid bar. Each cuff has a rotating arm which engages with a ratchet that prevents it from being opened once closed around a person's wrist. Without the key, the handcuffs cannot be removed without specialist knowledge, and the handcuffed person cannot move their wrists more than a few centimetres or inches apart, making many tasks difficult or impossible.","image":"Handcuffs01_2003-06-02.jpg.webp","url":"Handcuffs"}
