{"title":"Karoshi","summary":"Karoshi (過労死, Karōshi), which can be translated literally as \"overwork death\", is a Japanese term relating to occupational sudden mortality. The most common medical causes of karoshi deaths are heart attacks or strokes due to stress and a starvation diet. Mental stress from the workplace can also cause karoshi through workers taking their own lives. People who commit suicide due to overwork are called karōjisatsu (過労自殺). The phenomenon of death by overwork is also widespread in other parts of Asia. 745,194 deaths worldwide were attributable to long working hours in 2016, based on WHO/ILO data.[1]","image":"Nomorekaroshi-shimbashiprotest-june-13-2018.jpg.webp","url":"Karoshi"}
