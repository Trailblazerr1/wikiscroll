{"title":"Irrawaddy River","summary":"The Irrawaddy or, officially, Ayeyarwady River[5] (Burmese: ဧရာဝတီမြစ်; MLCTS: erawa.ti mrac, pronounced [ʔèjàwədì mjɪʔ], eventually from Indic revatī \"abounding in riches\"[6]) is a river that flows from north to south through Burma. It is the country's largest river and most important commercial waterway. Originating from the confluence of the N'mai and Mali rivers,[7] it flows relatively straight North-South before emptying through the Irrawaddy Delta in the Ayeyarwady Region into the Andaman Sea. Its drainage basin of about 404,200 square kilometres (156,100 sq mi) covers a large part of Burma. After Rudyard Kipling's poem, it is sometimes referred to as 'The Road to Mandalay'.","image":"Irrawaddy-River-Myanmar-Burma-2005.jpg.webp"}
