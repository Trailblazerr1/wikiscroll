{"title":"Sultan","summary":"Sultan (/ˈsʌltən/; Arabic: سلطان‎ sulṭān, pronounced [sʊlˈtˤɑːn, solˈtˤɑːn]) is a position with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic abstract noun meaning \"strength\", \"authority\", \"rulership\", derived from the verbal noun سلطة sulṭah, meaning \"authority\" or \"power\". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall caliphate, or to refer to a powerful governor of a province within the caliphate. The adjective form of the word is \"sultanic\",[1] and the dynasty and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a sultanate (سلطنة salṭanah).","image":"EmperorSuleiman.jpg.webp"}
