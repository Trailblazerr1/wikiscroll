{"title":"Signing of the United States Declaration of Independence","summary":"The signing of the United States Declaration of Independence occurred primarily on July 4, 1776, at the Pennsylvania State House, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The 56 delegates to the Second Continental Congress represented the 13 colonies, 12 of which voted to approve the Declaration of Independence on July 2, 1776. The New York delegation abstained because they had not yet received instructions from Albany to vote for independence.  The Declaration proclaimed the signatory colonies were now \"free and independent States,\" no longer colonies of the Kingdom of Great Britain and, thus, no longer a part of the British Empire. The signersâ€™ names are grouped by state, with the exception of John Hancock, as President of the Continental Congress; the states are arranged geographically from south to north, with Button Gwinnett from Georgia first, and Matthew Thornton from New Hampshire last.","image":"Declaration_of_Independence_(1819)%2C_by_John_Trumbull.jpg.webp"}
