{"title":"Pandemic","summary":"A pandemic (from Greek πᾶν, pan, \"all\" and δῆμος, demos, \"local people\" the 'crowd') is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across a large region, for instance multiple continents or worldwide, affecting a substantial number of individuals. A widespread endemic disease with a stable number of infected individuals is not a pandemic. Widespread endemic diseases with a stable number of infected individuals such as recurrences of seasonal influenza are generally excluded as they occur simultaneously in large regions of the globe rather than being spread worldwide.","image":"Doutielt3.jpg.webp"}
