{"title":"California English","summary":"California English (or Californian English) collectively refers to varieties of American English native to California. A distinctive vowel shift was only first noted by linguists in the 1980s in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California,[1] helping to define an accent emerging primarily among youthful, white, urban, coastal speakers, and popularly associated with the Valley girl and surfer dude youth subcultures.[2][3] The possibility that this is, in fact, an age-specific variety of English is one hypothesis;[4] however, certain features of the variety are intensifying and spreading geographically.","image":"California_vowel_shift.png.webp"}
