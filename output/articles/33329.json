{"title":"Ornette Coleman","summary":"Randolph Denard Ornette Coleman (March 9, 1930 â€“ June 11, 2015)[1] was an American jazz saxophonist, violinist, trumpeter, and composer known as a principal founder of the free jazz genre, a term derived from his 1960 album Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation. His pioneering performances often abandoned the chordal and harmony-based structure found in bebop, instead emphasizing a jarring and avant-garde approach to improvisation.[2]","image":"Ornette-Coleman-2008-Heidelberg-schindelbeck.jpg.webp"}
