{"title":"Trough (meteorology)","summary":"A trough is an elongated region of relatively low atmospheric pressure without a closed isobaric contour that would define it as a low pressure area. Since low pressure implies a low height on a pressure surface, troughs and ridges refer to features in an identical sense as those on a topographic map.","image":"Trough.jpg.webp","url":"Trough_(meteorology)"}
