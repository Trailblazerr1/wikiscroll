{"title":"German passport","summary":"German passport (German: Deutscher Reisepass, pronounced [ˈdɔɪ̯t͡ʃɐ ˈʁaɪ̯zəˌpas] (listen)) are issued to nationals of Germany for the purpose of international travel. A German passport is, besides the German ID card and the German Emergency Travel Document (called \"Reiseausweis als Passersatz\"), the only other officially recognised document that German authorities will routinely accept as proof of identity from German citizens. Besides serving as proof of identity and presumption of German nationality, they facilitate the process of securing assistance from German consular officials abroad (or other EU members in the case that a German consular facility is absent). German passports are valid for ten years (for people over the age of 24) or six years (for people under the age of 24) and share the standardised layout and burgundy red design with other EU passports. Every German citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card, allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Union, European Economic Area and Switzerland.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
