{"title":"Tao Te Ching","summary":"The Tao Te Ching (UK: /ˌtaʊ tiː ˈtʃɪŋ/,[1] US: /ˌdaʊ dɛ ˈdʒɪŋ/;[2] simplified Chinese: 道德经; traditional Chinese: 道德經; pinyin: Dàodé Jīng [tâu tɤ̌ tɕíŋ] (listen))[note 1] is a Chinese classic text traditionally credited to the 6th-century BC sage Laozi.[7] The text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are debated.[8] The oldest excavated portion dates back to the late 4th century BC,[9] but modern scholarship dates other parts of the text as having been written—or at least compiled—later than the earliest portions of the Zhuangzi.[10]","image":"Mawangdui_LaoTsu_Ms2.JPG.webp","url":"Tao_Te_Ching"}
