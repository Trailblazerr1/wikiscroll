{"title":"Alluvium","summary":"Alluvium (from the Latin alluvius, from alluere, \"to wash against\") is loose clay, silt, sand, or gravel that has been deposited by running water in a stream bed, on a floodplain, in an alluvial fan or beach, or in similar settings.[1][2][3] Alluvium is also sometimes called alluvial deposit.[4][5] Alluvium is typically geologically young and is not consolidated into solid rock. Sediments deposited underwater, in seas, estuaries, lakes, or ponds, are not described as alluvium.[1]","image":"Alluvial_Gravels_at_the_Blue_Ribbon_Mine_Alaska.jpg.webp","url":"Alluvium"}
