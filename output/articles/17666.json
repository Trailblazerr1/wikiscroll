{"title":"Genetic history of Italy","summary":"The genetic history of Italy is greatly influenced by geography and history. The ancestors of Italians are mostly Indo-European speakers (e.g. Italic peoples such as Latins, Umbrians, Samnites, Oscans, Sicels and Adriatic Veneti, as well as Celts, Iapygians and Greeks) and pre-Indo-European speakers (Etruscans, Rhaetians and Camunni in mainland Italy, Sicani and Elymians in Sicily and the Nuragic people in Sardinia). During the imperial period of Ancient Rome, the city of Rome was also home to people from various regions throughout the Mediterranean basin, including Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.[2] Based on DNA analysis, there is evidence of ancient regional genetic substructure and continuity within modern Italy dating to the pre-Roman and Roman periods.[3][4][5][6]","image":"Principal_Component_Analysis_of_the_Italian_population.png.webp","url":"Genetic_history_of_Italy"}
