{"title":"NFL Scouting Combine","summary":"The NFL Scouting Combine is a week-long showcase occurring every February at Lucas Oil Stadium (and formerly at the RCA Dome until 2008) in Indianapolis, where college football players perform physical and mental tests in front of National Football League coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the NFL Draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Its origins have evolved from the National, BLESTO,[1] and Quadra Scouting organizations in 1977 to the media event it has become today.","image":"NFL_Scouting_Combine_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"NFL_Scouting_Combine"}
