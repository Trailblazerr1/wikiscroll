{"title":"Arthur Conan Doyle bibliography","summary":"Arthur Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (1859–1930) was a Scottish writer and physician. In addition to the series of stories chronicling the activities of Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr John Watson for which he is well-known, Doyle wrote on a wide range of topics, both fictional and non-fictional.[1] In 1876 Doyle entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School, where he became a pupil of Joseph Bell, whose deductive processes impressed his pupil so much that the teacher became the chief model for Holmes.[1] Doyle began writing while still a student, and in October 1879 he had his first work—\"The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley\"—published in Chambers's Journal.[2] He continued writing short works—both fictional and non-fictional—throughout his career, and had over 200 stories and articles published.[3]","image":"Conan_doyle.jpg.webp","url":"Arthur_Conan_Doyle_bibliography"}
