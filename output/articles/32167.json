{"title":"Nitric oxide","summary":"Nitric oxide (nitrogen oxide[6] or nitrogen monoxide) is a colorless gas with the formula NO.  It is one of the principal oxides of nitrogen. Nitric oxide is a free radical: it has an unpaired electron, which is sometimes denoted by a dot in its chemical formula (•N=O or •NO).  Nitric oxide is also a heteronuclear diatomic molecule, a class of molecules whose study spawned early modern theories of chemical bonding.[7]","image":"Nitric-oxide-2D.svg.png.webp"}
