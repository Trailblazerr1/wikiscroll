{"title":"Biochemistry","summary":"Biochemistry or biological chemistry, is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms.[1]  A sub-discipline of both chemistry and biology, biochemistry may be divided into three fields: structural biology, enzymology and metabolism.  Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become successful at explaining living processes through these three disciplines.  Almost all areas of the life sciences are being uncovered and developed through biochemical methodology and research.[2]  Biochemistry focuses on understanding the chemical basis which allows biological molecules to give rise to the processes that occur within living cells and between cells,[3] in turn relating greatly to the understanding of tissues and organs, as well as organism structure and function.[4] Biochemistry is closely related to molecular biology, which is the study of the molecular mechanisms of biological phenomena.[5]","image":"Myoglobin.png.webp","url":"Biochemistry"}
