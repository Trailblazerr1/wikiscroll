{"title":"Gharial","summary":"The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), also known as the gavial or the fish-eating crocodile, is a crocodilian in the family Gavialidae and among the longest of all living crocodilians. Mature females are 2.6–4.5 m (8 ft 6 in–14 ft 9 in) long, and males 3–6 m (9 ft 10 in–19 ft 8 in). Adult males have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ghara, hence the name \"gharial\". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.","image":"Gharial_(Gavialis_gangeticus)_male.jpg.webp","url":"Gharial"}
