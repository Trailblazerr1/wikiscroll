{"title":"Loyalty","summary":"Loyalty, in general use, is a devotion and faithfulness to a nation, cause, philosophy, country, group, or person.[1] Philosophers disagree on what can be an object of loyalty, as some argue that loyalty is strictly interpersonal and only another human being can be the object of loyalty. The definition of loyalty in law and political science is the fidelity of an individual to a nation, either one's nation of birth, or one's declared home nation by oath (naturalization).","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Loyalty"}
