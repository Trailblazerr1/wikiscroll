{"title":"Social behavior","summary":"Social behavior is behavior among two or more organisms within the same species, and encompasses any behavior in which one member affects the other. This is due to an interaction among those members.[1][2] Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive the same.[3] This behavior can be affected by both the qualities of the individual and the environmental (situational) factors. Therefore, social behavior arises as a result of an interaction between the two—the organism and its environment. This means that, in regards to humans, social behavior can be determined by both the individual characteristics of the person, and the situation they are in.[4]","image":"Basstölpelkolonie_auf_Helgoland.jpg.webp"}
