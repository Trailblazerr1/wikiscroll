{"title":"Sign language","summary":"Sign languages (also known as signed languages) are languages that use the visual-manual modality to convey meaning. Sign languages are expressed through manual articulations in combination with non-manual elements. Sign languages are full-fledged natural languages with their own grammar and lexicon.[1] Sign languages are not universal and they are not mutually intelligible with each other,[2] although there are also striking similarities among sign languages.","image":"ASL_family.jpg.webp","url":"Sign_language"}
