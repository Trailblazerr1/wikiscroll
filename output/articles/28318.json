{"title":"Manorialism","summary":"Manorialism, also known as the manor system or manorial system,[1][2] was the method of land ownership (or \"tenure\") in parts of Europe, notably England, during the Middle Ages.[3] Its defining features included a large, sometimes fortified manor house in which the lord of the manor and his dependents lived and administered a rural estate, and a population of labourers who worked the surrounding land to support themselves and the lord. These labourers fulfilled their obligations with labour time or in-kind produce at first, and later by cash payment as commercial activity increased. Manorialism is sometimes included in the definition of feudalism.","image":"Bayeux_Tapestry_scene23_Harold_sacramentum_fecit_Willelmo_duci.jpg.webp"}
