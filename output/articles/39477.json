{"title":"Saturation diving","summary":"Saturation diving is diving for periods long enough to bring all tissues into equilibrium with the partial pressures of the inert components of the breathing gas. It is a diving technique that allows divers working at great depths to reduce the total time spent undergoing decompression. A diver breathing pressurized gas accumulates dissolved inert gas used in the mixture to dilute the oxygen to a non-toxic level in their tissues, which can cause decompression sickness (\"the bends\") if permitted to come out of solution within the body tissues; hence, returning to the surface safely requires lengthy decompression so that the inert gases can be eliminated in the lungs. Once the dissolved gases in a diver's tissues reach the saturation point, however, decompression time does not increase with further exposure, as no more inert gas is accumulated.[1][2] Saturation divers typically breathe a heliumâ€“oxygen mixture to prevent nitrogen narcosis, but at shallow depths saturation diving has been done on nitrox mixtures.","image":"US_Navy_010703-N-5329L-005_Diver_working_on_USS_Monitor_salvage.jpg.webp","url":"Saturation_diving"}
