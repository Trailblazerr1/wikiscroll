{"title":"Tower of Silence","summary":"A dakhma (Persian: دخمه), also known as a Tower of Silence, is a circular, raised structure built by Zoroastrians for excarnation–that is, the exposure of human dead bodies to the elements for decay in order to avert contamination of the soil with the corpses.[1][2][3] Carrion birds, usually vultures and other scavengers, would typically consume the flesh and the skeletal remains would have been left in the pit.[1][2]","image":"ZoroastrianismSymbolWhite.PNG.webp"}
