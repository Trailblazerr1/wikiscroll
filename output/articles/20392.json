{"title":"Histamine","summary":"Histamine is an organic nitrogenous compound involved in local immune responses, as well as regulating physiological function in the gut and acting as a neurotransmitter for the brain, spinal cord, and uterus.[3][4] Since histamine was discovered in 1910, it has been considered as a local hormone (autocoid) because it lacks the classic endocrine glands to secrete it, however, in recent years, histamine has been recognized as a central neurotransmitter.[5] Histamine is involved in the inflammatory response and has a central role as a mediator of itching.[6] As part of an immune response to foreign pathogens, histamine is produced by basophils and by mast cells found in nearby connective tissues.  Histamine increases the permeability of the capillaries to white blood cells and some proteins, to allow them to engage pathogens in the infected tissues.[7] It consists of an imidazole ring attached to an ethylamine chain; under physiological conditions, the amino group of the side-chain is protonated.","image":"Histamine.svg.png.webp"}
