{"title":"Tugboat","summary":"A tugboat or tug is a marine vessel that manoeuvres other vessels by pushing or pulling them, with direct contact or a tow line. These boats typically tug ships that cannot move well on their own, such as those in crowded harbours or narrow canals,[1] or those that cannot move at all, such as barges, disabled ships, log rafts, or oil platforms. The tugboat, for its size, is the most powerful craft afloat. Some are ocean-going, some are icebreakers or salvage tugs. Early models had steam engines, and modern ones have diesel engines. Many have deluge guns, which help in firefighting, especially in harbours.","image":"Tug_Boat_NY_1.jpg.webp"}
