{"title":"Electrical conductor","summary":"In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge (electric current) in one or more directions. Materials made of metal are common electrical conductors. Electric current is generated by the flow of negatively charged electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in some cases.","image":"Electrical_wires_near_Putim.jpg.webp"}
