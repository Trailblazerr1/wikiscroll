{"title":"Transcendental Meditation technique","summary":"The Transcendental Meditation technique (abbreviated as TM) is the technique associated with the practice of Transcendental Meditation developed by the Indian spiritual figure Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The practice involves the use of a private mantra, and is practised for 20 minutes twice per day while sitting comfortably with one's eyes closed.[1][2] Unlike some other approaches to meditation, TM instruction encourages students not to be alarmed by random thoughts which may arise, but to easily return to the mantra when one becomes aware of this.[3]","image":"Maharishi_Centre_for_Educational_Excellence%2C_Bhopal%2C_Madhya_Pradesh%2C_India..jpg.webp","url":"Transcendental_Meditation_technique"}
