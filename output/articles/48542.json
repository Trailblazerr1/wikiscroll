{"title":"William Borah","summary":"William Edgar Borah (June 29, 1865 – January 19, 1940) was an outspoken Republican United States Senator, one of the best-known figures in Idaho's history.  A progressive who served from 1907 until his death in 1940, Borah is often considered an isolationist,[lower-alpha 1] because he led the Irreconcilables, senators who would not accept the Treaty of Versailles, Senate ratification of which would have made the U.S. part of the League of Nations.","image":"William_Edgar_Borah_cph.3b19589.jpg.webp","url":"William_Borah"}
