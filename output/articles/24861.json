{"title":"Kingdom of Italy","summary":"The Kingdom of Italy (Italian: Regno d'Italia) was a state that existed from 1861—when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy—until 1946, when civil discontent led an institutional referendum to abandon the monarchy and form the modern Italian Republic. The state was founded as a result of the Risorgimento under the influence of the Savoy-led Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state.","image":"Flag_of_Italy_(1861-1946)_crowned.svg.png.webp"}
