{"title":"Ming dynasty","summary":"The Ming dynasty (/mɪŋ/),[7] officially the Great Ming, was the ruling dynasty of China from 1368 to 1644 following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China ruled by Han Chinese. Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng (who established the Shun dynasty, soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty), numerous rump regimes ruled by remnants of the Ming imperial family—collectively called the Southern Ming—survived until 1662.[lower-alpha 4]","image":"Seal_of_Ming_dynasty.svg.png.webp","url":"Ming_dynasty"}
