{"title":"Pika","summary":"A pika (/ˈpaɪkə/ PY-kə; archaically spelled pica) is a small, mountain-dwelling mammal found in Asia and North America. With short limbs, very round body, an even coat of fur, and no external tail, they resemble their close relative, the rabbit, but with short, rounded ears.[3] The large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby mountains is found at heights of more than 6,000 m (20,000 ft), among the highest of any mammal.","image":"American_pika_(ochotona_princeps)_with_a_mouthful_of_flowers.jpg.webp","url":"Pika"}
