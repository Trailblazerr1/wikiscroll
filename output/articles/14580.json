{"title":"Elk","summary":"The elk (Cervus canadensis), also known as the wapiti,  is one of the largest species within the deer family, Cervidae, and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in its native range of North America, Central and East Asia. It is often confused with the larger Alces alces, which is called moose in North America, but called elk in British English, and related names in other European languages (German Elch, Swedish älg, French élan). The name \"wapiti\" is used in Europe for Cervus canadensis. It originates from the Shawnee and Cree word waapiti, meaning 'white rump'.","image":"Jasper.Wapiti-Hirsch.P1033401.jpg.webp"}
