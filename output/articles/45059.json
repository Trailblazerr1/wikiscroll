{"title":"Thrips","summary":"Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (mostly 1Â mm long or less), slender insects with fringed wings and unique asymmetrical mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, although a few are predators. Entomologists have  described approximately 6,000 species. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.","image":"Thysanoptera.jpg.webp","url":"Thrips"}
