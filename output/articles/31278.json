{"title":"Narwhal","summary":"The narwhal, also known as a narwhale (Monodon monoceros), is a medium-sized toothed whale that possesses a large \"tusk\" from a protruding canine tooth. It lives year-round in the Arctic waters around Greenland, Canada, and Russia. It is one of two living species of whale in the family Monodontidae, along with the beluga whale. The narwhal males are distinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left canine.
