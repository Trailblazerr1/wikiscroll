{"title":"Indole","summary":"Indole is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound with formula C8H7N. It has a bicyclic structure, consisting of a six-membered benzene ring fused to a five-membered pyrrole ring. Indole is widely distributed in the natural environment and can be produced by a variety of bacteria. As an intercellular signal molecule, indole regulates various aspects of bacterial physiology, including spore formation, plasmid stability, resistance to drugs, biofilm formation, and virulence.[2] The amino acid tryptophan is an indole derivative and the precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin.[3]","image":"Indole_2D_numbered.svg.png.webp"}
