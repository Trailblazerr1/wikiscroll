{"title":"Mile","summary":"The mile, sometimes the international mile or statute mile to distinguish it from other miles, is a British imperial unit and US customary unit of distance; both are based on the older English unit of length equal to 5,280 English feet, or 1,760 yards. The statute mile was standardised between the British Commonwealth and the United States by an international agreement in 1959, when it was formally redefined with respect to SI units as exactly 1,609.344 metres.","image":"Milestone%2C_Knightsbridge%2C_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1590514.jpg.webp"}
