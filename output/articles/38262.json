{"title":"Rochester, New York","summary":"Rochester (/ˈrɒtʃɛstər, -ɪs-/) is a city in the U.S. state of New York, the seat of Monroe County, and the fourth-most populous in the state after New York City, Buffalo, and Yonkers with a population of 211,328 in 2020.[3] The city of Rochester forms the core of a larger metropolitan area with a population of 1 million people, across six counties, which in turn is part of the larger Western New York region that has a population of roughly 2.5 million. The city was one of the United States' first boomtowns, initially due to the fertile Genesee River Valley, which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing center, which spurred further rapid population growth.[4]","image":"RochesterCollage4.jpg.webp"}
