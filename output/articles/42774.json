{"title":"Super Bowl","summary":"The Super Bowl is the annual championship game of the National Football League (NFL). It has served as the final game of every NFL season since 1966, replacing the NFL Championship Game. Since 2004, the game has been played on the first Sunday in February. Prior Super Bowls were played on Sundays in early to mid-January from 1967 to 1978 and late January from 1979 to 2003.[lower-alpha 1] Winning teams are awarded the Vince Lombardi Trophy, named after the eponymous coach who won the first two Super Bowl games. Due to the NFL restricting use of its \"Super Bowl\" trademark, it is frequently referred to as the \"big game\" or other generic terms by non-sponsoring corporations.","image":"Super_Bowl_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Super_Bowl"}
