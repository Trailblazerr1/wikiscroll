{"title":"Sannyasa","summary":"Sannyasa (Sanskrit: संन्यास; IAST: Saṃnyāsa) is life of renunciation and the fourth stage within the Hindu system of four life stages known as Ashramas, with the first three being Brahmacharya (bachelor student), Grihastha (householder) and Vanaprastha (forest dweller, retired).[1] Sannyasa is traditionally conceptualized for men or women in late years of their life, but young brahmacharis have had the choice to skip the householder and retirement stages, renounce worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicate their lives to spiritual pursuits.","image":"1_Om.svg.png.webp","url":"Sannyasa"}
