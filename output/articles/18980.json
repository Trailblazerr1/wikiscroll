{"title":"Greta Thunberg","summary":"Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg (Swedish: [ˈɡrêːta ˈtʉ̂ːnbærj] (listen); born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish environmental activist who is known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action for climate change mitigation.[4] She speaks fluent English, and most of her public interactions are in English. Thunberg initially gained notice for her youth and her straightforward and blunt speaking manner,[5] both in public and to political leaders and assemblies, in which she criticizes world leaders for their failure to take what she considers sufficient action to address the climate crisis.[6]","image":"Greta_Thunberg_urges_MEPs_to_show_climate_leadership_(49618310531)_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Greta_Thunberg"}
