{"title":"Exfoliation (cosmetology)","summary":"Exfoliation involves the removal of the oldest dead skin cells from the skin's surface. The word comes from the Latin word exfoliare (to strip off leaves).[1] Exfoliation is involved in all facials and can be achieved by mechanical or chemical means, such as microdermabrasion or chemical peels.[2] Exfoliants are often advertised as treatments that promote beauty, youthful appearance, or health.[3][4]","image":"Skin.png.webp"}
