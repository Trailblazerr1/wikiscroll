{"title":"English people","summary":"The English people are an ethnic group and nation native to England, who speak the English language and share a common history and culture.[9] The English identity is of early medieval origin, when they were known in Old English as the Angelcynn ('race or tribe of the Angles'). Their ethnonym is derived from the Angles, one of the Germanic peoples who migrated to Great Britain around the 5th century AD.[10]","image":"Flag_of_England.svg.png.webp","url":"English_people"}
