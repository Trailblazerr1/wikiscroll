{"title":"Laser","summary":"A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The word \"laser\" is an acronym[1][2] for \"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\".[3][4][5] The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow (https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200312/history.cfm).","image":"Lasertechnik06.jpg.webp","url":"Laser"}
