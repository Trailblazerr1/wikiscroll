{"title":"Non-governmental organization","summary":"A non-governmental organization, nongovernmental organization, non-government organization, or simply an NGO, is an organization that is, generally, formed independent from government.[2][3][4][5][6] They are typically nonprofit entities, and many of them are active in humanitarianism or the social sciences; they can also include clubs and associations that provide services to their members and others. Surveys indicate that NGOs have a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.[7] However, NGOs can also be lobby groups for corporations, such as the World Economic Forum.[8][9][10][11]","image":"Pekka_Haavisto_-_World_NGO_Day%2C_Finland.jpg.webp","url":"Non-governmental_organization"}
