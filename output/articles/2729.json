{"title":"Aldol reaction","summary":"The aldol reaction is a means of forming carbon–carbon bonds in organic chemistry.[1][2][3]\nDiscovered independently by the Russian chemist Alexander Borodin in 1869[4] and by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz in 1872,[5][6][7] the reaction combines two carbonyl compounds (the original experiments used aldehydes) to form a new β-hydroxy carbonyl compound. These products are known as aldols, from the aldehyde + alcohol, a structural motif seen in many of the products. Aldol structural units are found in many important molecules, whether naturally occurring or synthetic.[8][9][10]\nFor example, the aldol reaction has been used in the large-scale production of the commodity chemical pentaerythritol[11]\nand the synthesis of the heart disease drug Lipitor (atorvastatin, calcium salt).[12][13]","image":"Typical_aldol-en.svg.png.webp"}
