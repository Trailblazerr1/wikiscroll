{"title":"International airport","summary":"An international airport is an airport with customs and border control facilities enabling passengers to travel between countries.  International airports are usually larger than domestic airports and often feature longer runways and facilities to accommodate the heavier aircraft commonly used for international and intercontinental travel. International airports often also host domestic flights, which often help feed both passengers and cargo into international ones (and vice-versa).","image":"San_Francisco_International_Airport_at_night.jpg.webp"}
