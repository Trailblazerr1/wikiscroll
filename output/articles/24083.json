{"title":"Judo","summary":"Judo (柔道, jūdō, Japanese pronunciation: [dʑɯꜜːdoː], lit. \"gentle way\") is a modern Japanese martial art, a system of unarmed combat, and now primarily a sport.[3] Judo is not only a training of body and mind, but also a way of human formation.[4][5] Judo was created in 1882 by Jigoro Kano (嘉納治五郎、1860–1938).[4][3]  He studied old jujutsu,[4] which is martial arts of Samurai, but he, as a pedagogue, decided to eliminate \"the most dangerous techniques\" [3]  and created new \"Kano Jiu-Jitsu\", which is now widely known as Judo. The ultimate goal of all judo practitioners is \"Seiryoku-Zenyo (精力善用) and Jita-Kyoei (自他共栄)\".[4]","image":"Jigoro_Kano_and_Kyuzo_Mifune_(restoration).jpg.webp","url":"Judo"}
