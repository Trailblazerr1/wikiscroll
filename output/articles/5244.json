{"title":"B cell","summary":"B cells, also known as B lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell of the lymphocyte subtype.[1] They function in the humoral immunity component of the adaptive immune system.[1] B cells produce antibody molecules; however, these antibodies are not secreted. Rather, they are inserted into the plasma membrane where they serve as a part of B-cell receptors.[2] When a na√Øve or memory B cell is activated by an antigen, it proliferates and differentiates into an antibody-secreting effector cell, known as a plasmablast or plasma cell.[2] Additionally, B cells present antigens (they are also classified as professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs)) and secrete cytokines.[1]\nIn mammals, B cells mature in the bone marrow, which is at the core of most bones.[3] In birds, B cells mature in the bursa of Fabricius, a lymphoid organ where they were first discovered by Chang and Glick,[3] which is why the 'B' stands for bursa and not bone marrow as commonly believed.","image":"Human_B_Lymphocyte_(28942386960).jpg.webp"}
