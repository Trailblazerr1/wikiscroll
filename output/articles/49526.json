{"title":"Zohar","summary":"The Zohar (Hebrew: זֹהַר‎, lit. \"Splendor\" or \"Radiance\"; Yiddish: דער זוהר‎, romanized: der Zoyer) is a foundational work in the literature of Jewish mystical thought known as Kabbalah.[1] It is a group of books including commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah (the five books of Moses) and scriptural interpretations as well as material on mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. The Zohar contains discussions of the nature of God, the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls, redemption, the relationship of Ego to Darkness and \"true self\" to \"The Light of God\". Its scriptural exegesis can be considered an esoteric form of the rabbinic literature known as Midrash, which elaborates on the Torah.","image":"Kabbalah_\"ein_sof\"_chart.png.webp","url":"Zohar"}
