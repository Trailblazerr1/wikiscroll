{"title":"Airplane!","summary":"Airplane! (alternatively titled Flying High!)[5] is a 1980 American parody film written and directed by David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams in their directorial debuts,[6] and produced by Jon Davison. It stars Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty and features Leslie Nielsen, Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges, Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Lorna Patterson.[6] The film is a parody of the disaster film genre—particularly the 1957 Paramount film Zero Hour!, from which it borrows the plot and central characters[7]—as well as many elements from Airport 1975 and other films in the Airport series. Airplane! is known for its use of surreal humor and fast-paced slapstick comedy, including visual and verbal puns, gags, running jokes, and obscure humor.","image":"Airplane!_(1980_film).jpg.webp","url":"Airplane!"}
