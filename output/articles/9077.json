{"title":"Central Canada","summary":"Central Canada (French: Centre du Canada, sometimes the Central provinces) is a region consisting of Canada's two largest and most populous provinces: Ontario and Quebec.[1] Geographically, they are not at the centre of Canada but instead overlap with Eastern Canada toward the east. Due to their high populations, Ontario and Quebec have traditionally held a significant amount of political power in Canada, leading to some amount of resentment from other regions of the country.  Before Confederation, the term \"Canada\" specifically referred to Central Canada.  Today, the term \"Central Canada\" is less often used than the names of the individual provinces.","image":"Canada_ottawa_parliament_monument_landscape-1051590.jpg.webp"}
