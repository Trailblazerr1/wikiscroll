{"title":"The New Church (Swedenborgian)","summary":"The New Church (or Swedenborgianism) is any of several historically related Christian denominations that developed as a new religious group, influenced by the writings of scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688â€“1772). According to Swedenborg, he received a new revelation from Christ in visions he experienced over a period of at least twenty-five years. He predicted in his writings that God would replace the traditional Christian Church, establishing a New Church that would worship Jesus Christ as God, rather than the Trinity. According to New Church doctrine, each person must cooperate in repentance, reformation, and regeneration.[1]","image":"Swedenborgian_cross.PNG.webp"}
