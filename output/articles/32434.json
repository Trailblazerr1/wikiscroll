{"title":"Northern pintail","summary":"The pintail or northern pintail (Anas acuta) is a duck species with wide geographic distribution that breeds in the northern areas of Europe and across the Palearctic and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its breeding range to the equator. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton's pintail is considered to be a separate species.","image":"Northern_Pintails_(Male_%26_Female)_I_IMG_0911.jpg.webp"}
