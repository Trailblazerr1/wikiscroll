{"title":"Boris Berezovsky (businessman)","summary":"Boris Abramovich Berezovsky (Russian: Борис Абрамович Березовский; 23 January 1946 – 23 March 2013),[4][5] also known as Platon Elenin,[6] was a Russian business oligarch, government official, engineer and mathematician. He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Berezovsky was politically opposed to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin from Putin's election in 2000; he remained a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life.[7] In late 2000, after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning, he did not return from abroad and moved to the UK, which granted him political asylum in 2003.[8] In Russia, Berezovsky was later convicted in absentia of fraud and embezzlement. The first charges were brought during Primakov's government in 1999.[9] Despite an Interpol Red Notice for Berezovsky's arrest, Russia repeatedly failed to obtain the extradition of Berezovsky from Britain; the situation became a major point of diplomatic tension between the two countries.[10][11][12]","image":"Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman).jpg.webp","url":"Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)"}
