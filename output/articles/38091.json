{"title":"Riverside International Raceway","summary":"Riverside International Raceway (sometimes known as Riverside, RIR, or Riverside Raceway) was a motorsports race track and road course established in the Edgemont area of Riverside County, California, just east of the city limits of Riverside and 50 miles east of Los Angeles, in 1957.  In 1984, the raceway became part of the newly incorporated city of Moreno Valley. Riverside was noted for its hot, dusty environment and for being a somewhat complicated and dangerous track for drivers. It was also considered one of the finest tracks in the United States.[1] The track was in operation from September 22, 1957, to July 2, 1989, with the last race, The Budweiser 400,[2] won by Rusty Wallace,[3] held in 1988. After that final race, a shortened version of the circuit was kept open for car clubs and special events until 1989.[4]","image":"RIRLogo.jpg.webp"}
