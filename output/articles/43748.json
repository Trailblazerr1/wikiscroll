{"title":"Territories of the United States","summary":"Territories of the United States are sub-national administrative divisions overseen by the U.S. federal government. The various U.S. territories differ from the U.S. states and Native American tribes in that they are not sovereign entities.[note 2] In contrast, each state has a sovereignty separate from that of the federal government and each federally recognized Native American tribe possesses limited tribal sovereignty as a \"dependent sovereign nation\".[9] Territories are classified by incorporation and whether they have an \"organized\" government through an organic act passed by the Congress.[10] U.S. territories are under U.S. sovereignty and, consequently, may be treated as part of the United States proper in some ways and not others.[11] Unincorporated territories in particular are not considered to be integral parts of the United States,[12] and the Constitution of the United States applies only partially in those territories.[13][14][10][15]","image":"Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp","url":"Territories_of_the_United_States"}
