{"title":"Black-shouldered kite","summary":"The black-shouldered kite (Elanus axillaris), also known as the Australian black-shouldered kite, is a small raptor found in open habitat throughout Australia. It resembles similar species found in Africa, Eurasia and North America, including the black-winged kite, a species that has in the past also been called \"black-shouldered kite\". Measuring around 35 cm (14 in) in length with a wingspan of 80–100 cm (31–39 in), the adult black-shouldered kite has predominantly grey-white plumage and prominent black markings above its red eyes. It gains its name from the black patches on its wings. The primary call is a clear whistle, uttered in flight and while hovering. It can be confused with the related letter-winged kite in Australia, which is distinguished by the striking black markings under its wings.","image":"Elanus_axillaris_-Royal_Botanic_Gardens%2C_Cranbourne%2C_Melbourne%2C_Victoria%2C_Australia-8.jpg.webp","url":"Black-shouldered_kite"}
