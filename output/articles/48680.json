{"title":"Windows 1.0x","summary":"Windows 1.0 is a graphical operating environment for personal computers, developed by Microsoft. Microsoft had worked with  Apple Computer to develop applications for Apple's 1984  original Macintosh, the first mass-produced personal computer with a  graphical user-interface (GUI) that enabled  users to see user-friendly icons on screen. Microsoft released Windows 1.0 on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the Microsoft Windows line. It is a type of software that runs as a graphical, 16-bit  multi-tasking shell on top of an existing MS-DOS installation, providing an environment which can run graphical  programs designed for Windows, as well as existing MS-DOS software. Microsoft's founder Bill Gates spearheaded the development of Windows 1.0 after he saw a demonstration of a similar software suite, Visi On, at COMDEX in 1982.","image":"Windows_logo_and_wordmark_-_(1985-1989).svg.png.webp"}
