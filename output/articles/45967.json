{"title":"Trinity","summary":"The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from Latin: trinus \"threefold\")[1] defines God as being one god existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial persons:[2][3] God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit — three distinct persons sharing one essence.[4] In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is.[5] This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians. Nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, Binitarianism and Modalism.","image":"Švenčiausioji_Trejybė.jpg.webp"}
