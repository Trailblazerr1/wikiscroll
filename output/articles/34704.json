{"title":"Pharmacology","summary":"Pharmacology is a branch of medicine, biology and pharmaceutical sciences concerned with drug or medication action,[1] where a drug may be defined as any artificial, natural, or endogenous (from within the body) molecule which exerts a biochemical or physiological effect on the cell, tissue, organ, or organism (sometimes the word pharmacon is used as a term to encompass these endogenous and exogenous bioactive species). More specifically, it is the study of the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical function. If substances have medicinal properties, they are considered pharmaceuticals.","image":"Constant_tempertature_bath_for_isolated_organs_Wellcome_M0013241.jpg.webp","url":"Pharmacology"}
