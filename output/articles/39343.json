{"title":"Sanger sequencing","summary":"Sanger sequencing (also: Chain termination sequencing) is a method of DNA sequencing based on the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication.[1][2] After first being developed by Frederick Sanger and colleagues in 1977, it became the most widely used sequencing method for approximately 40 years. It was first commercialized by Applied Biosystems in 1986.[3] More recently, higher volume Sanger sequencing has been replaced by \"Next-Gen\" sequencing methods, especially for large-scale, automated genome analyses. However, the Sanger method remains in wide use, for smaller-scale projects, and for validation of Next-Gen results. It still has the advantage over short-read sequencing technologies (like Illumina) in that it can produce DNA sequence reads of > 500 nucleotides.","image":"Sanger-sequencing.svg.png.webp","url":"Sanger_sequencing"}
