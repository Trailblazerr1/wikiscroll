{"title":"Electronics","summary":"The field of electronics is a branch of physics and electrical engineering that deals with the emission, behaviour and effects of electrons using electronic devices.[1] Electronics uses active devices to control electron flow by amplification and rectification, which distinguishes it from classical electrical engineering, which only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance and inductance to control electric current flow.","image":"Arduino_ftdi_chip-1.jpg.webp","url":"Electronics"}
