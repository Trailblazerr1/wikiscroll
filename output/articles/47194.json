{"title":"Vector graphics","summary":"Vector graphics, as a form of computer graphics, is the set of mechanisms for creating visual images directly from  geometric shapes defined on a Cartesian plane, such as points, lines, curves, and polygons. These mechanisms may include vector display and printing hardware, vector data models and file formats, and software based on these data models (especially graphic design software, Computer-aided design, and Geographic information systems). Vector graphics are an alternative to raster graphics, each having advantages and disadvantages in general and in specific situations.[1]","image":"VectorBitmapExample.svg.png.webp"}
