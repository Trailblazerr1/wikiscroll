{"title":"Cell wall","summary":"A cell wall is a structural layer surrounding some types of cells, just outside the cell membrane. It can be tough, flexible, and sometimes rigid. It provides the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism.[1] Cell walls are absent in animals but are present in most other eukaryotes including algae, fungi and plants and in most prokaryotes (except mollicute bacteria).  A major function is to act as pressure vessels, preventing over-expansion of the cell when water enters.","image":"Plant_cell_structure_svg_labels.svg.png.webp"}
