{"title":"Opportunistic infection","summary":"An opportunistic infection is an infection caused by pathogens (bacteria, fungi, parasites or viruses) that take advantage of an opportunity not normally available. These opportunities can stem from a variety of sources, such as a weakened immune system (as can occur in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or when being treated with immunosuppressive drugs, as in cancer treatment),[1] an altered microbiome (such as a disruption in gut microbiota), or breached integumentary barriers (as in penetrating trauma). Many of these pathogens do not cause disease in a healthy host that has a non-compromised immune system, and can, in some cases, act as commensals until the balance of the immune system is disrupted.[2][3] Opportunistic infections can also be attributed to pathogens that cause mild illness in healthy individuals but lead to more serious illness when given the opportunity to take advantage of an immunocompromised host.[4]","image":"Chest_X-ray_in_influenza_and_Haemophilus_influenzae_-_annotated.jpg.webp"}
