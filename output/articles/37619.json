{"title":"Repeating decimal","summary":"A repeating decimal or recurring decimal is decimal representation of a number whose digits are periodic (repeating its values at regular intervals) and the infinitely repeated portion is not zero. It can be shown that a number is rational if and only if its decimal representation is repeating or terminating (i.e. all except finitely many digits are zero). For example, the decimal representation of 1/3 becomes periodic just after the decimal point, repeating the single digit \"3\" forever, i.e. 0.333.... A more complicated example is 3227/555, whose decimal becomes periodic at the second digit following the decimal point and then repeats the sequence \"144\" forever, i.e. 5.8144144144.... At present, there is no single universally accepted notation or phrasing for repeating decimals.","image":"33327363d1549636c607f9f23c8e73cb52081b10.svg"}
