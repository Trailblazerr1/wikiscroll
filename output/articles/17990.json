{"title":"Gewürztraminer","summary":"Gewürztraminer (German: [ɡəˈvʏʁtstʁaˈmiːnɐ]) is an aromatic wine grape variety, used in white wines, and performs best in cooler climates. In English, it is sometimes referred to colloquially as Gewürz (/ɡəˈvʊərts, -ˈvɜːrts/; although this is never the case in German, because \"Gewürz\" means \"herb\" or \"spice\"), and in English and French it is written Gewurztraminer (without the umlaut). Gewürztraminer is a variety with a pink to red skin colour, which makes it a \"white wine grape\" as opposed to the blue to black-skinned varieties commonly referred to as \"red wine grapes\". The variety has high natural sugar and the wines are white and usually off-dry, with a flamboyant bouquet of lychees. Indeed, Gewürztraminer and lychees share the same aroma compounds.[1] Dry Gewürztraminers may also have aromas of roses, passion fruit and floral notes. It is not uncommon to notice some spritz (fine bubbles on the inside of the glass).","image":"Gewürztramine_Viala_et_Vermorelr.jpg.webp"}
