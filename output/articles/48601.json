{"title":"William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham","summary":"William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, PC, FRS (15 November 1708 – 11 May 1778) was a British statesman of the Whig group who served as Prime Minister of Great Britain in the middle of the 18th century. Historians call him Pitt of Chatham, or William Pitt the Elder, to distinguish him from his son, William Pitt the Younger, who also was a prime minister. Pitt was also known as the Great Commoner, because of his long-standing refusal to accept a title until 1766.","image":"William_Pitt%2C_1st_Earl_of_Chatham_after_Richard_Brompton.jpg.webp","url":"William_Pitt,_1st_Earl_of_Chatham"}
