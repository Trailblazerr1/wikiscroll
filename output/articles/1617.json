{"title":"VAX","summary":"VAX is a CISC instruction set architecture (ISA) and line of superminicomputers and workstations developed by the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in the mid-1970s.  The VAX-11/780, introduced October 25, 1977, was the first of a range of popular and influential computers implementing the VAX ISA. The VAX family was a huge success for DEC - over 100 models were introduced over the lifetime of the design, with the last members arriving in the early 1990s. The VAX was succeeded by the DEC Alpha, which included several features from VAX machines to make porting from the VAX easier.","image":"Dec-vax-logo.png.webp","url":"A%2fVAX"}
