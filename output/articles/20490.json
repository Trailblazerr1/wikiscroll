{"title":"History of Texas A&M University","summary":"The history of Texas A&M University, the first public institution of higher education in Texas, began in 1871, when the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas was established as a land-grant college by the Reconstruction-era Texas Legislature. Classes began on October 4, 1876. Although Texas A&M was originally scheduled to be established under the Texas Constitution as a branch of the yet-to-be-created University of Texas, subsequent acts of the Texas Legislature never gave the university any authority over Texas A&M.  In 1875, the Legislature separated the administrations of A&M and the University of Texas, which still existed only on paper.","image":"Agricultural_and_Mechanical_College_of_Texas_(1916).jpg.webp","url":"History_of_Texas_A&M_University"}
