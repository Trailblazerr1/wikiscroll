{"title":"Experimental pop","summary":"Experimental pop is pop music that cannot be categorized within traditional musical boundaries[1][2] or which attempts to push elements of existing popular forms into new areas.[3] It may incorporate experimental techniques such as musique concr√®te, aleatoric music, or eclecticism into pop contexts.[4] Often, the compositional process involves the use of electronic production effects to manipulate sounds and arrangements,[2] and the composer may draw the listener's attention specifically with both timbre and tonality, though not always simultaneously.[5]","image":"Brian_Wilson_1976_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Experimental_pop"}
