{"title":"Aurora (Sleeping Beauty)","summary":"Princess Aurora, also known as Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose,[1][2][3] is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Productions' 16th animated feature film Sleeping Beauty (1959). Originally voiced by singer Mary Costa, Aurora is the only child of King Stefan and Queen Leah. An evil fairy named Maleficent seeks revenge for not being invited to Aurora's christening and curses the newborn princess, foretelling that she will die before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday by pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle. Merryweather, however, was able to weaken the curse so Aurora would fall into a deep sleep instead of dying. Determined to prevent this, three good fairies raise Aurora as a peasant in order to protect her, patiently awaiting her sixteenth birthday â€” the day the spell can only be broken by a kiss from her true love, Prince Phillip.","image":"Princess_aurora_disney.png.webp","url":"Aurora_(Sleeping_Beauty)"}
