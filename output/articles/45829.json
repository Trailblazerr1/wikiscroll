{"title":"Travertine","summary":"Travertine (/ˈtrævərˌtiːn/[1] TRA-vər-teen) is a form of terrestrial limestone deposited around mineral springs, especially hot springs. Travertine often has a fibrous or concentric appearance and exists in white, tan, cream-colored, and even rusty varieties.[2][3] It is formed by a process of rapid precipitation of calcium carbonate, often at the mouth of a hot spring or in a limestone cave. In the latter, it can form stalactites, stalagmites, and other speleothems. It is frequently used in Italy and elsewhere as a building material.","image":"Mammoth_Terraces.jpg.webp","url":"Travertine"}
