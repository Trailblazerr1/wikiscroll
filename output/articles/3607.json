{"title":"Android One","summary":"Android One is a family of third-party Android smartphones promoted by Google. In comparison to many third-party Android devices, which ship with a manufacturer's customized user interface and bundled apps, these devices run near-stock versions of Android with limited modifications, and a focus on Google services (although they may still feature software enhancements to support the features of included hardware, such as cameras).[1] Devices that run Android One receive OS updates for at least two years after their release, and security patches for at least three years.","image":"Android_One_logo_2019.svg.png.webp"}
