{"title":"Hainan","summary":"Hainan (UK: /haɪˈnæn/, US: /-nɑːn/;[5] 海南) is the smallest and southernmost province of the People's Republic of China (PRC), consisting of various islands in the South China Sea. Hainan Island, the largest and most populous island in China,[note 1] makes up the vast majority (97%) of the province.  \"Hainan\", the name of the island and the province, literally means \"south of the sea\", reflecting its position south of the Qiongzhou Strait, which separates it from Guangdong's Leizhou Peninsula and the rest of the Chinese mainland. In the Chinese language, Hainan is officially known as Hainan Dao.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
