{"title":"Microsatellite","summary":"A microsatellite is a tract of repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (ranging in length from one to six or more base pairs) are repeated, typically 5â€“50 times.[1][2] Microsatellites occur at thousands of locations within an organism's genome. They have a higher mutation rate than other areas of DNA[3] leading to high genetic diversity. Microsatellites are often referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) by forensic geneticists and in genetic genealogy, or as simple sequence repeats (SSRs) by plant geneticists.[4]","image":"STR-Slippage_Dr.Peter_Forster.jpg.webp","url":"Microsatellite"}
