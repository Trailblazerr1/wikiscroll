{"title":"Ranitidine","summary":"Ranitidine, sold under the brand name Zantac among others, is a medication used to decrease stomach acid production.[4] It was commonly used in treatment of peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome.[4] It can be given by mouth, injection into a muscle, or injection into a vein. In September 2019, the probable carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was discovered in ranitidine products from a number of manufacturers, resulting in recalls.[6][7][8][9] In April 2020, it was withdrawn from the United States market and suspended in the European Union and in Australia due to these concerns.[10][11][12][13][14] As of December 2021 it was not available, and no company had announced plans to reintroduce it.","image":"Ranitidine.svg.png.webp","url":"Ranitidine"}
