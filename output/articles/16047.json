{"title":"Fertilisation","summary":"Fertilisation or fertilization (see spelling differences), also known as generative fertilisation, syngamy and impregnation,[1] is the fusion of gametes to give rise to a new individual organism or offspring and initiate its development. Processes such as insemination or pollination which happen before the fusion of gametes are also sometimes informally called fertilisation.[2] The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called sexual reproduction. During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid polar nuclei to      form a triploid primary endosperm nucleus by the process of vegetative fertilisation.","image":"Sperm-egg.jpg.webp","url":"Fertilisation"}
