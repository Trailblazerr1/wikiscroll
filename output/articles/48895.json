{"title":"Working memory","summary":"Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that can hold information temporarily.[1] Working memory is important for reasoning and the guidance of decision-making and behavior.[2][3] Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information.[2][4] Working memory is a theoretical concept central to cognitive psychology, neuropsychology, and neuroscience.","image":"Baddeley_and_Hitch's_Working_Memory_Model.png.webp","url":"Working_memory"}
