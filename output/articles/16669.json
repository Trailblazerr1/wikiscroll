{"title":"Foreplay","summary":"Foreplay is a set of emotionally and physically intimate acts between two or more people meant to create sexual arousal and desire for sexual activity.[1] Although foreplay is typically understood as physical sexual activity, nonphysical activities, such as mental or verbal acts, may in some contexts be foreplay.[1] This is typically the reason why foreplay tends to be an ambiguous term and means different things to different people. It can consists of various sexual practices such as kissing, sexual touching, removing clothing, oral sex, sexual games, and role playing.[1]","image":"Nipping_the_Nape.png.webp"}
