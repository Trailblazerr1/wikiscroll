{"title":"The General in His Labyrinth","summary":"The General in His Labyrinth (original Spanish title: El general en su laberinto) is a 1989 dictator novel by Colombian writer and Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez. It is a fictionalized account of the last seven months of Simón Bolívar, liberator and leader of Gran Colombia. The book traces Bolívar's final journey from Bogotá to the Caribbean coastline of Colombia in his attempt to leave South America for exile in Europe. Breaking with the traditional heroic portrayal of Bolívar El Libertador, García Márquez depicts a pathetic protagonist, a prematurely aged man who is physically ill and mentally exhausted.[1] The story explores the labyrinth of Bolívar's life through the narrative of his memories, in which \"despair, sickness, and death inevitably win out over love, health, and life\".[2]","image":"Garcia_marquez_general.jpg.webp"}
