{"title":"Rule of law","summary":"The rule of law is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"[t]he authority and influence of law in society, especially when viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behavior; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes.\"[2] The term rule of law is closely related to constitutionalism as well as Rechtsstaat and refers to a political situation, not to any specific legal rule.[3][4][5]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp","url":"Rule_of_law"}
