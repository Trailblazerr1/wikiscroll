{"title":"Ten Commandments in Catholic theology","summary":"The Ten Commandments are  series of religious and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including the Catholic Church.[1] As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin.[2] According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth,[3] and serve as the basis for Catholic social teaching.[4] A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.[5]","image":"João_Zeferino_da_Costa_-_Moisés_recebendo_as_tábuas_da_lei_-_1868.jpg.webp"}
