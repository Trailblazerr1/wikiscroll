{"title":"Ready-to-wear","summary":"Ready-to-wear (or prêt-à-porter) is often abbreviated RTW (\"off-the-rack\" or \"off-the-peg\" in casual use). It is the term for ready-made garments, sold in finished condition in standardized sizes, as distinct from made-to-measure or bespoke clothing tailored to a particular person's frame. In other words, It is a piece of clothing that was mass produced in different sizes and sold that way instead of it being designed and sewn for one person. The term off-the-peg is sometimes used for items other than clothing, such as handbags.","image":"ClothingReadyWear.jpg.webp","url":"Ready-to-wear"}
