{"title":"Mandolin","summary":"A mandolin (Italian: mandolino pronounced [mandoˈliːno]; literally \"small mandola\") is a stringed musical instrument in the lute family and is generally plucked with a plectrum. It most commonly has four courses of doubled metal strings tuned in unison, thus giving a total of 8 strings, although five (10 strings) and six (12 strings) course versions also exist. The courses are typically tuned in an interval of perfect fifths, with the same tuning as a violin (G3, D4, A4, E5). Also, like the violin, it is the soprano member of a family that includes the mandola, octave mandolin, mandocello and mandobass.","image":"Paris_Swing_Samois_Mandolin_MS-130-SN.jpg.webp","url":"Mandolin"}
