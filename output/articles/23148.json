{"title":"Je suis Charlie","summary":"\"Je suis Charlie\" (French pronunciation: ​[ʒə sɥi ʃaʁli], French for '\"I am Charlie\"') is a slogan and logo created by French art director Joachim Roncin and adopted by supporters of freedom of speech and freedom of the press after the 7 January 2015 shooting in which twelve people were killed at the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo. It identifies a speaker or supporter with those who were killed at the Charlie Hebdo shooting, and by extension, a supporter of freedom of speech and resistance to armed threats. Some journalists embraced the expression as a rallying cry for the freedom of self-expression.[2]","image":"Je_suis_Charlie.svg.png.webp","url":"Je_suis_Charlie"}
