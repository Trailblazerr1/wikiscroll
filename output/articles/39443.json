{"title":"Sarojini Naidu","summary":"Sarojini Naidu (née Chattopadhyay; 13 February 1879 – 2 March 1949)[1] was an Indian political activist and poet. A proponent of civil rights, women's emancipation, and anti-imperialistic ideas, she was an important figure in India's struggle for independence from colonial rule. Naidu's work as a poet earned her the sobriquet 'the Nightingale of India', or 'Bharat Kokila' by Mahatma Gandhi because of colour, imagery and lyrical quality of her poetry.[2]","image":"Sarojini_Naidu_1964_stamp_of_India.jpg.webp"}
