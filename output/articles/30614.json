{"title":"Motion of no confidence","summary":"A  motion of no confidence, vote of no confidence, or no confidence motion, sometimes in the reverse as a motion of confidence or vote of confidence, is a statement or vote about whether a person in a position of responsibility (government, management, etc.) is still deemed fit to hold that position, such as because they are inadequate in some aspect, fail to carry out their obligations, or make decisions that other members feel as being detrimental. The parliamentary motion demonstrates to the head of state that the elected Parliament either has or no longer has confidence in one or more members of the appointed government. In some countries, a no confidence motion being passed against an individual minister requires the minister to resign. In most cases, if the minister in question is the premier, all other ministers must also resign.","image":"Mariano_Rajoy_felicita_al_nuevo_presidente_del_Gobierno_Pedro_SÃ¡nchez_(2018-06-01).jpg.webp","url":"Motion_of_no_confidence"}
