{"title":"Chhinnamasta","summary":"Chhinnamasta (Sanskrit: छिन्नमस्ता, Chinnamastā, \"She whose head is severed\"), often spelled Chinnamasta, and also called Ch(h)innamastika and Prachanda Chandika and Jogani Maa (in western states of India), is a Hindu goddess (Devi). She is one of the Mahavidyas, ten goddesses from the esoteric tradition of Tantra, and a ferocious aspect of Parvati, the Hindu Mother goddess. The self-decapitated nude goddess, usually standing or seated on a divine copulating couple, holds her own severed head in one hand and a scimitar in another. Three jets of blood spurt out of her bleeding neck and are drunk by her severed head and two attendants.","image":"Calcutta_art_studio_Chinnamasta.jpg.webp"}
