{"title":"Grande Armée","summary":"La Grande Armée (French pronunciation: ​[ɡʀɑ̃d aʀme]; French for The Great Army) was the French Imperial Army commanded by French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte during the Napoleonic Wars. From 1804 to 1809, it won a series of military victories that allowed the French Empire to exercise unprecedented control over most of Europe. Widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest fighting forces ever assembled in history, it suffered enormous losses during the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, after which it never recovered its tactical superiority.","image":"Emblem_of_Napoleon_Bonaparte.svg.png.webp"}
