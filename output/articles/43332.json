{"title":"Talking Book","summary":"Talking Book is the fifteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter and musician Stevie Wonder, released on October 28, 1972, on the Tamla label for Motown Records. This album and Music of My Mind are widely noted as being the signal recordings of Wonder's \"classic period\".[4] The sound of the album is sharply defined by Wonder's keyboard work, especially with synthesizers. His use of the Hohner clavinet model C on \"Superstition\" is widely regarded as one of the definitive tracks featuring the instrument.[5]","image":"Talking_Book.jpg.webp"}
