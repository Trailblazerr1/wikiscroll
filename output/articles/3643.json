{"title":"Anemia","summary":"Anemia, also spelled anaemia and sometimes called erythrocytopenia,[lower-alpha 1] is a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood[3][4] or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen.[5] When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include feeling tired, weakness, shortness of breath, and a poor ability to exercise.[1] When the anemia comes on quickly, symptoms may include confusion, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, and increased thirst.[1] Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale.[1] Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause.[1] For people who require surgery, pre-operative anemia can increase the risk of requiring a blood transfusion following surgery.[6]","image":"Iron_deficiency_anemia_blood_film.jpg.webp","url":"Anemia"}
