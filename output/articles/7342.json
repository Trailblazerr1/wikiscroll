{"title":"Bourbon whiskey","summary":"Bourbon (/bɜːrbən/) is a type of American whiskey, a barrel-aged distilled liquor made primarily from corn. The name derives from the French Bourbon dynasty, although the precise inspiration is uncertain; contenders include Bourbon County in Kentucky and Bourbon Street in New Orleans, both of which are named after the dynasty.[1] The name \"Bourbon\" was not applied until the 1850s, and the Kentucky etymology was not advanced until the 1870s.[1]","image":"DecaturBourbons.jpg.webp"}
