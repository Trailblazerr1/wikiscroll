{"title":"Danish People's Party","summary":"The Danish People's Party (DPP) (Danish: Dansk Folkeparti, DF) is a nationalist and right-wing populist political party in Denmark.[2][15][16][17][18] The party was founded in 1995 by Pia Kjærsgaard, who was the leader of the party until 2012, when she passed the leadership on to Kristian Thulesen Dahl. The DPP lent its support to the Liberal-Conservative government that ruled from the general election of 2001 until the 2011 election defeat. While not part of the cabinet, DPP cooperated closely with the governing coalition on most issues and received support for key political stances in return, to the point that the government was commonly referred to as the \"VKO-government\" (O being DPP's election symbol).[19] It also provided parliamentary support to Lars Løkke Rasmussen's cabinets from 2016 to 2019, again without participating in it.","image":"Dansk_Folkeparti_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
