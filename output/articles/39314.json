{"title":"Sand Creek massacre","summary":"The Sand Creek massacre (also known as the Chivington massacre, the battle of Sand Creek or the massacre of Cheyenne Indians) was a massacre of Cheyenne and Arapaho people by the U.S. Army in the American Indian Wars that occurred on November 29, 1864, when a 675-man force of the Third Colorado Cavalry[5] under the command of U.S. Volunteers Colonel John Chivington attacked and destroyed a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho people in southeastern Colorado Territory,[6] killing and mutilating an estimated 69 to over 600 Native American people.   Chivington claimed 500 to 600 warriors were killed, however most sources estimate around 150 people were killed, about two-thirds of whom were women and children.[4][2][7][8] The location has been designated the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site and is administered by the National Park Service. The massacre is considered part of a series of events known as the Colorado War.","image":"At_the_Sand_Creek_Massacre%2C_1874-1875.jpg.webp"}
