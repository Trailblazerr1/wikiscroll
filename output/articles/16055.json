{"title":"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder","summary":"Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.[1] Symptoms can include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, behavioural problems, learning difficulties, and problems with hearing and sight.[1][2] Those affected are more likely to have trouble with school, the legal system, alcohol, other drugs, and other areas of high risk.[8] The several forms of the condition (in order of most severe to least severe) are: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS),[1] Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (pFAS), Alcohol-Related Birth Defects (ARBD),[1][9]Static Encephalopathy,[10] Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder (ARND) and Neurobehavioral Disorder associated with Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (ND-PAE).[11] Some authorities accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.[12]","image":"Photo_of_baby_with_FAS.jpg.webp"}
