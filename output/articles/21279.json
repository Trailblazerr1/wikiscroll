{"title":"Hyper-V","summary":"Microsoft Hyper-V, codenamed Viridian,[1] and briefly known before its release as Windows Server Virtualization, is a native hypervisor; it can create virtual machines on x86-64 systems running Windows.[2] Starting with Windows 8, Hyper-V superseded Windows Virtual PC as the hardware virtualization component of the client editions of Windows NT. A server computer running Hyper-V can be configured to expose individual virtual machines to one or more networks.\nHyper-V was first released with Windows Server 2008, and has been available without additional charge since Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8.  A standalone Windows Hyper-V Server is free, but with command-line interface only.","image":"Hyper-V_Logo.png.webp"}
