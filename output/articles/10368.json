{"title":"Coalition (Australia)","summary":"The Liberalâ€“National Coalition, commonly known simply as \"the Coalition\", is an alliance of centre-right political parties that forms one of the two major groupings in Australian federal politics. The two partners in the Coalition are the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia (the latter previously known as the Country Party and the National Country Party). Its main opponent is the Australian Labor Party (ALP); the two forces are often regarded as operating in a two-party system. The Coalition has been in government since the 2013 federal election, most recently being re-elected in the 2019 Australian federal election. The group is led by Scott Morrison as Prime Minister of Australia since August 2018.","image":"Liberal-National_Coalition_of_Australia.png.webp","url":"Coalition_(Australia)"}
