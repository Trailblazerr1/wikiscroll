{"title":"Buddhahood","summary":"In Buddhism, Buddha (/ˈbuːdə, ˈbʊdə/), \"awakened one\",[1] is a title for those who are awake, and have attained nirvana and Buddhahood through their own efforts and insight, without a teacher to point out the dharma (Sanskrit; Pali dhamma; \"right way of living\"). The title is most commonly used for Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, who is often simply known as \"the Buddha\". Buddhahood (Sanskrit: buddhatva; Pali: buddhatta or buddhabhāva; Chinese: 成佛) is the condition and  rank of a buddha \"awakened one\".[2] This highest spiritual state of being is also termed Samyaksaṃbodhi (Full complete Awakening).","image":"Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg.webp"}
