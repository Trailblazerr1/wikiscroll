{"title":"Memorandum of understanding","summary":"A memorandum of understanding (MoU) is a type of agreement between two (bilateral) or more (multilateral) parties. It expresses a convergence of will between the parties, indicating an intended common line of action.[1] It is often used either in cases where parties do not imply a legal commitment or in situations where the parties cannot create a legally enforceable agreement. It is a more formal alternative to a gentlemen's agreement.[2][3]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Memorandum_of_understanding"}
