{"title":"Nitrile","summary":"A nitrile is any organic compound that has a −C≡N functional group.[1] The prefix cyano- is used interchangeably with the term nitrile in industrial literature. Nitriles are found in many useful compounds, including methyl cyanoacrylate, used in super glue, and nitrile rubber, a nitrile-containing polymer used in latex-free laboratory and medical gloves. Nitrile rubber is also widely used as automotive and other seals since it is resistant to fuels and oils. Organic compounds containing multiple nitrile groups are known as cyanocarbons.","image":"Nitrile_Structural_Formulae_V.1.png.webp","url":"Nitrile"}
