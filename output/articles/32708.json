{"title":"Octal","summary":"The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7, that is to say 10 represents 8 in decimal and 100 represents 64 in decimal. However, English uses a base-10 number language system, hence a true octal system might use different language to avoid confusion with the decimal system.","image":"a79337e370dac156042f618e518bb41e369d55c1.svg","url":"Octal"}
