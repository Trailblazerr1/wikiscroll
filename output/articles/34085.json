{"title":"Patagonian mara","summary":"The Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum) is a relatively large rodent in the mara genus Dolichotis.[3] It is also known as the Patagonian cavy, Patagonian hare, or dillaby. This herbivorous, somewhat rabbit-like animal is found in open and semiopen habitats in Argentina, including large parts of Patagonia. A population has also been recorded in the northern United Arab Emirates, possibly as a result of escaped pets or captive animals. It is monogamous, but often breeds in warrens shared by several pairs.","image":"Dolichotis_patagonum_-Temaiken_Zoo-8b-1c.jpg.webp","url":"Patagonian_mara"}
