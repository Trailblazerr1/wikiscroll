{"title":"CyanogenMod","summary":"CyanogenMod (/saɪˈænoʊdʒɛnmɒd/ sy-AN-o-jen-mod; CM) is a discontinued open-source operating system for mobile devices, based on the Android mobile platform. It was developed as free and open-source software based on the official releases of Android by Google, with added original and third-party code, and based on a rolling release development model. Although only a subset of total CyanogenMod users elected to report their use of the firmware,[8] on 23 March 2015, some reports indicated that over 50 million people ran CyanogenMod on their phones.[9][10] It was also frequently used as a starting point by developers of other ROMs.","image":"CyanogenMod_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"CyanogenMod"}
