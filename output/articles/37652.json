{"title":"Republic of Venice","summary":"The Republic of Venice (Italian: Repubblica di Venezia;[1] Venetian: Repùblega de Venèsia) or Venetian Republic (Italian: Repubblica Veneta;[2] Venetian: Repùblega Vèneta), traditionally known as La Serenissima (English: Most Serene Republic of Venice; Italian: Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia; Venetian: Serenìsima Repùblega de Venèsia), was a sovereign state and maritime republic in parts of present-day Italy (mainly northeastern Italy) which existed for 1100 years from 697 AD until 1797 AD. Centered on the lagoon communities of the prosperous city of Venice, it incorporated numerous overseas possessions in modern Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Greece, Albania and Cyprus.[3] The republic grew into a trading power during the Middle Ages and strengthened this position in the Renaissance. Citizens spoke the still-surviving Venetian language, although publishing in (Florentine) Italian became the norm during the Renaissance.","image":"Flag_of_Republic_of_Venice_(1659-1675).svg.png.webp","url":"Republic_of_Venice"}
