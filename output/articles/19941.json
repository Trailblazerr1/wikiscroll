{"title":"Heinkel He 111","summary":"The Heinkel He 111 was a German bomber aircraft designed by Siegfried and Walter GÃ¼nter at Heinkel Flugzeugwerke in 1934. Through development it was described as a \"wolf in sheep's clothing\". Due to restrictions placed on Germany after the First World War prohibiting bombers, it masqueraded as a civil airliner, although from conception the design was intended to provide the nascent Luftwaffe with a fast medium bomber.[3]","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-343-0694-21%2C_Belgien-Frankreich%2C_Flugzeug_Heinkel_He_111.jpg.webp","url":"Heinkel_He_111"}
