{"title":"Bupropion","summary":"Bupropion, sold under the brand names Wellbutrin and Zyban among others, is an atypical antidepressant primarily used to treat major depressive disorder and to support smoking cessation.[6][7] Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own, but it is also popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.[7][8] Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction;[7] it is not associated with weight gain[7] and sleepiness,[9] and it is more effective than SSRIs at improving symptoms of hypersomnia and fatigue.[10] Bupropion does, however, carry a much higher risk of seizure than many other antidepressants and extreme caution must be taken in patients with a history of seizure disorder.","image":"Bupropion_1.svg.png.webp"}
