{"title":"Quantum Hall effect","summary":"The quantum Hall effect (or integer quantum Hall effect) is a quantized version of the Hall effect which is observed in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to low temperatures and strong magnetic fields, in which the Hall resistance Rxy exhibits steps that take on the quantized values","image":"dd86a2343ffdfff421dafed9c25cf66d541e104f.svg"}
