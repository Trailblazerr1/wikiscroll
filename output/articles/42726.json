{"title":"Summerteeth","summary":"Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is the third studio album by the American alternative rock band Wilco (stylized as wilco), released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's marital problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed in the studio with Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, a contrast to the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.","image":"Wilco_-_Summerteeth.png.webp","url":"Summerteeth"}
