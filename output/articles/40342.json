{"title":"Shebaa Farms","summary":"Shebaa Farms, also spelled Sheba'a Farms (Arabic: مزارع شبعا‎, Mazāri' Šib‘ā; Hebrew: חוות שבעא‎, Havot Sheba‘a or הר דוב, Har Dov) is a small strip of land at the intersection of the Lebanese-Syrian border and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The territory is named for the farms within it which were historically tended by the inhabitants of the town of Shebaa. It is about 11 kilometres (7 mi) long and 2.5 kilometres (2 mi) wide. Both Islamic and Jewish tradition hold that a location in the Sheeba farms, called Maqam 'Ibrahim al-Khalil in Arabic and Makom Habětarim in Hebrew, is the site of the covenant of the pieces, God's first covenant with Abraham, in the biblical land of Israel.[1]","image":"Shebaa_Farms.jpg.webp","url":"Shebaa_Farms"}
