{"title":"Interface (computing)","summary":"In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The exchange can be between software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans, and combinations of these.[1] Some computer hardware devices, such as a touchscreen, can both send and receive data through the interface, while others such as a mouse or microphone may only provide an interface to send data to a given system.[2]","image":"RJ-45_Ethernet_socket_on_Lenovo_T410_Laptop.jpg.webp"}
