Standing a few feet from U.S. President George W. Bush,[1] in front of an audience of celebrities, politicians, and members of the White House Press Corps,[2] Colbert delivered a controversial, searing routine targeting the president and the media.[3] He spoke in the persona of the character he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of conservative pundits such as Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity.[4][5]","image":"Time_100_Stephen_Colbert_and_wife.jpg.webp","url":"Stephen_Colbert_at_the_2006_White_House_Correspondents'_Dinner"}
