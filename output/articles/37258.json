{"title":"Reactive attachment disorder","summary":"Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children.[1][2] RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts.  It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate wayâ€”known as the \"inhibited form\". In the DSM-5, the \"disinhibited form\" is considered a separate diagnosis named \"disinhibited attachment disorder\".","image":"Mother-Child_face_to_face.jpg.webp"}
