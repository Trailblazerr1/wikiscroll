{"title":"Circumcision","summary":"Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin from the human penis.[1][2] In the most common procedure the foreskin is extended with forceps (in pre-pubescent children its normal adhesion to the glans must also be broken with a probe), then a circumcision device may be placed, after which the foreskin is excised. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is often used to reduce pain and physiologic stress.[3] The procedure is usually an elective surgery performed on babies and children as a prophylactic health intervention, as generally done in several Anglosphere countries and Africa; or as a religious duty or cultural tradition, as in Israel and Islamic world.[4][5] Medically, circumcision is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis and balanoposthitis that do not resolve with other treatments, and for chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs).[6][7] It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.[1][7]","image":"Circumcision_central_Asia2.jpg.webp"}
