His 18-year term as general secretary was second only to Joseph Stalin's in duration. While Brezhnev's rule was characterised by political stability and significant foreign policy successes, it was also marked by corruption, inefficiency, economic stagnation, and rapidly growing technological gaps with the West.","image":"Staatshoofden%2C_portretten%2C_Bestanddeelnr_925-6564_(cropped)(d).jpg.webp"}
