{"title":"Profit (economics)","summary":"An economic profit is the difference between the revenue a  commercial entity has received from its outputs and the opportunity costs of its inputs.[1][2] Unlike an accounting profit, an economic profit takes into account both a firm's  implicit and  explicit costs, whereas an accounting profit only relates to the explicit costs which appear on a firm's financial statements. Because it includes additional implicit costs, the economic profit usually differs from the accounting profit.[3]","image":"Capitalismlogo.svg.png.webp"}
