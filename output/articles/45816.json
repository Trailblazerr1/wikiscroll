{"title":"Trapezoid","summary":"In Euclidean geometry, a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides is referred to as a trapezium (/trəˈpiːziəm/) in English outside North America, but as a trapezoid[1][2] (/ˈtræpəzɔɪd/) in  American and Canadian English. The parallel sides are called the bases of the trapezoid and the other two sides are called the legs or the lateral sides (if they are not parallel; otherwise there are two pairs of bases). A scalene trapezoid is a trapezoid with no sides of equal measure,[3] in contrast with the special cases below.","image":"Trapezoid.svg.png.webp"}
