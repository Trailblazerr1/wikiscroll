{"title":"Cetacea","summary":"Cetaceans  (from Latin: cetus, lit. 'whale', from Ancient Greek: κῆτος, romanized: kētos, lit. 'huge fish', sea monster)[1] are aquatic mammals constituting the infraorder Cetacea (/sɪˈteɪʃə/). Key characteristics are their fully aquatic lifestyle, streamlined body shape, often large size and exclusively carnivorous diet. They propel themselves through the water with powerful up-and-down movement of their tail which ends in a paddle-like fluke, using their flipper-shaped forelimbs to maneuver.[2]","image":"The_Cetacea.jpg.webp"}
