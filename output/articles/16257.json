{"title":"First Bank of the United States","summary":"The President, Directors and Company of the Bank of the United States, commonly known as the First Bank of the United States, was a national bank, chartered for a term of twenty years, by the United States Congress on February 25, 1791. It followed the Bank of North America, the nation's first de facto national bank. However, neither served the functions of a modern central bank: They did not set monetary policy, regulate private banks, hold their excess reserves, or act as a lender of last resort.[1] They were national insofar as they were allowed to have branches in multiple states and lend money to the US government. Other banks in the US were each chartered by, and only allowed to have branches in, a single state.","image":"First_Bank_of_the_United_States%2C_Philadelphia%2C_Pennsylvania_LCCN2011633532_(edited).jpg.webp","url":"First_Bank_of_the_United_States"}
