{"title":"Hirsutism","summary":"Hirsutism is excessive body hair on parts of the body where hair is normally absent or minimal. The word is from early 17th century: from Latin hirsutus meaning \"hairy\".[2] It may refer to a \"male\" pattern of hair growth that may be a sign of a more serious medical condition,[3] especially if it develops well after puberty.[4] Cultural stigma against hirsutism can cause much psychological distress and social difficulty.[5] Discrimination based on facial hirsutism often leads to the avoidance of social situations and to symptoms of anxiety and depression.[6]","image":"Barbara_Vanbeck%2C_a_very_hairy_woman._Stipple_engraving_by_G._Wellcome_V0007287.jpg.webp"}
