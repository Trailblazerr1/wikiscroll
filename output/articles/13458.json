{"title":"Dormition of the Mother of God","summary":"The Dormition of the Mother of God is a Great Feast of the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches which celebrates the \"falling asleep\" (death) of Mary the Theotokos (\"Mother of God\", literally translated as God-bearer), and her being taken up into heaven (bodily assumption). It is celebrated on 15 August (28 August N.S. for those following the Julian Calendar) as the Feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God. The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates the Dormition not on a fixed date, but on the Sunday nearest 15 August.  In Western Churches the feast is known as the Assumption of Mary.","image":"Dormition_El_Greco.jpg.webp","url":"Dormition_of_the_Mother_of_God"}
