{"title":"Biblical Hebrew","summary":"Biblical Hebrew (עִבְרִית מִקְרָאִית‎, (Ivrit Miqra'it)   or לְשׁוֹן הַמִּקְרָא‎, (Leshon ha-Miqra)   ), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of the Hebrew language, a language in the Canaanite branch of Semitic languages spoken by the Israelites in the area known as the Land of Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \"Hebrew\" (ibrit) was not used for the language in the Bible,[1] which was referred to as שפת כנען (sefat kena'an, i.e. language of Canaan) or יהודית (Yehudit, i.e. Judaean),[1] but the name was used in Ancient Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts.[1]","image":"Shiloach.jpg.webp","url":"Biblical_Hebrew"}
