{"title":"Voltage","summary":"Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points, which (in a static electric field) is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. In the International System of Units, the derived unit for voltage (potential difference) is named volt.[1]: 166  In SI units, work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb, where 1 volt = 1 joule (of work) per 1 coulomb (of charge). The old SI definition for volt used power and current; starting in 1990, the quantum Hall and Josephson effect were used, and recently (2019) fundamental physical constants have been introduced for the definition of all SI units and derived units.[1]: 177f, 197f  Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolically by Δ V {\\displaystyle \\Delta V} , simplified V,[2] or U,[3] for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's circuit laws.","image":"aa0ec3d68205fb7f4452de096cb34a50f661111e.svg","url":"Voltage"}
