{"title":"Taenia solium","summary":"Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, belongs to the cyclophyllid cestode family Taeniidae. It is found throughout the world and is most common in countries where pork is eaten. It is a tapeworm which has humans as its definitive host and often pigs as intermediate or secondary host. It may be transmitted to pigs through human faeces contaminating their fodder, and back to humans through consumption of uncooked, or under-cooked, pork that contains tapeworm cysts. Pigs ingest tapeworm eggs, which develop into larvae, then into oncospheres, and ultimately into infective tapeworm cysts. An ingested tapeworm cyst grows into an adult worm in human small intestines.","image":"Taenia_solium_scolex.JPG.webp"}
