{"title":"Chinese Democracy","summary":"Chinese Democracy is the sixth studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, released on November 23, 2008 by Black Frog and Geffen Records. It was the first Guns N' Roses studio album since the 1993 covers album \"The Spaghetti Incident?\", and their first album of original studio material since Use Your Illusion I and II (1991). It was the first Guns N' Roses album without their longtime producer Mike Clink; instead, it was produced by singer Axl Rose and Caram Costanzo. It underwent a protracted recording process, delayed by personnel and legal problems and Rose's perfectionism.","image":"GNRchinesedemocracy.jpg.webp","url":"Chinese_Democracy"}
