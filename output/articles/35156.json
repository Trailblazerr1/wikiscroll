{"title":"Planet symbols","summary":"A planet symbol (or planetary symbol) is a graphical symbol used in astrology and astronomy to represent a classical planet (including the Sun and the Moon) or one of the eight modern planets. The symbols are also used in alchemy to represent the metals that are associated with the planets. The use of these symbols is based in ancient Greco-Roman astronomy, although their current shapes are a development of the 16th century.","image":"Moon_decrescent_symbol_(fixed_width).svg.png.webp","url":"Planet_symbols"}
