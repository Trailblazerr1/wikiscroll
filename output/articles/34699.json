{"title":"Phantom limb","summary":"A phantom limb is the sensation that an amputated or missing limb is still attached.  Approximately 80 to 100% of individuals with an amputation experience sensations in their amputated limb. However, only a small percentage will experience painful phantom limb sensation. These sensations are relatively common in amputees and usually resolve within two to three years without treatment. Research continues to explore the underlying mechanisms of phantom limb pain (PLP) and effective treatment options.[1]","image":"Ramachandran-mirrorbox.svg.png.webp"}
