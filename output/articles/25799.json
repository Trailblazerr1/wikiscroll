{"title":"Left-libertarianism","summary":"Left-libertarianism,[1][2][3][4][5] also known as egalitarian libertarianism,[6][7] left-wing libertarianism[8] or social libertarianism,[9] is a political philosophy and type of libertarianism that stresses both individual freedom and social equality. Left-libertarianism represents several related yet distinct approaches to political and social theory. In its classical usage, it refers to anti-authoritarian varieties of left-wing politics such as anarchism, especially social anarchism,[10] whose adherents simply call it libertarianism,[11] and libertarian socialism. The left wing of the green movement, including adherents of Murray Bookchin's social ecology, are also generally considered left-libertarian.","image":"2006_AEGold_Proof_Obv.png.webp","url":"Left-libertarianism"}
