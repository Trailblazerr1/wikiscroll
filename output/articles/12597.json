{"title":"Demotic (Egyptian)","summary":"Demotic (from Ancient Greek: δημοτικός dēmotikós, 'popular') is the ancient Egyptian script derived from northern forms of hieratic used in the Nile Delta, and the stage of the Egyptian language written in this script, following Late Egyptian and preceding Coptic. The term was first used by the Greek historian Herodotus to distinguish it from hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts. By convention, the word \"Demotic\" is capitalized in order to distinguish it from demotic Greek.","image":"DemoticScriptsRosettaStoneReplica.jpg.webp"}
