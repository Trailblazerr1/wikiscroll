{"title":"Femicide","summary":"Femicide or feminicide is a sex-based hate crime term, broadly defined as \"the intentional killing of women or girls because they are female\", though definitions vary depending on its cultural context.[1] Feminist author Diana E. H. Russell was the first person to define and disseminate this term in modern times, in 1976. She defines the word as \"the killing of females by males because they are female.\" Other feminists place emphasis on the intention or purpose of the act being directed at females specifically because they are female. Others include the killing of females by females.[2]","image":"Promulgation_of_law_against_femicide_Chile.jpg.webp","url":"Femicide"}
