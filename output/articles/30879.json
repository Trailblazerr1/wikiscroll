{"title":"Murray River","summary":"The Murray River (in South Australia: River Murray)[note 1] (Ngarrindjeri: Millewa, Yorta Yorta: Tongala)[2] is a river in south-eastern Australia.  It is Australia's longest river at 2,508 km (1,558 mi) extent.[3] Its tributaries include five of the next six longest rivers of Australia (the Murrumbidgee, Darling, Lachlan, Warrego and Paroo Rivers). Together with that of the Murray, the catchments of these rivers form the Murray–Darling basin, which covers about one-seventh the area of Australia. It is widely considered Australia's most important irrigated region.","image":"lossless-page1-400px-Map_of_the_Murray_River%2C_south-eastern_Australia.tif.png.webp"}
