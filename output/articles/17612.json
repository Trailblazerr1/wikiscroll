{"title":"Genealogy","summary":"Genealogy (from Greek: γενεαλογία genealogia \"study of family trees\")[2] is the study of families, family history, and the tracing of their lineages. Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate kinship and pedigrees of its members. The results are often displayed in charts or written as narratives. The field of family history is broader than genealogy, and covers not just lineage but also family and community history and biography.[3]","image":"900-158_Ahnentafel_Herzog_Ludwig.jpg.webp","url":"Genealogy"}
