{"title":"Anseriformes","summary":"Anseriformes /ˈænsərɪfɔːrmiːz/ is an order of birds also known as waterfowl that comprises about 180 living species of birds in three families: Anhimidae (the three screamers), Anseranatidae (the magpie goose), and Anatidae, the largest family, which includes over 170 species of waterfowl, among them the ducks, geese, and swans. Most modern species in the order are highly adapted for an aquatic existence at the water surface. With the exception of screamers, males have penises, a trait that has been lost in the Neoaves. Due to their aquatic nature, most species are web-footed.","image":"Magpie_goose.jpg.webp","url":"Anseriformes"}
