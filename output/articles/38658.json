{"title":"Roystonea regia","summary":"Roystonea regia, commonly known as the Cuban royal palm or Florida royal palm,[3] is a species of palm that is native to Mexico, parts of Central America and the Caribbean, and southern Florida. A large and attractive palm, it has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree. Although it is sometimes called R. elata, the conserved name R. regia is now the correct name for the species. The royal palm reaches heights from 50 to over 80 feet tall.[4] Populations in Cuba and Florida were long seen as separate species, but are now considered to belong to a single species.","image":"Roystonea_regia.jpg.webp","url":"Roystonea_regia"}
