{"title":"Wild horse","summary":"The wild horse (Equus ferus) is a species of the genus Equus, which includes as subspecies the modern domesticated horse (Equus ferus caballus) as well as the undomesticated European wild horse (Equus ferus ferus now extinct), and the endangered Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii).[2][3] The European horse known as the tarpan that went extinct in the late 1800s has previously been classified as a subspecies of wild horse, but more recent studied have cast doubt on whether those horses were truly wild, or if they actually were feral horses or hybrids.[4]","image":"Equus_ferus_(wild_horse)_gallery.jpg.webp","url":"Wild_horse"}
