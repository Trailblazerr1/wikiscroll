{"title":"Genetic drift","summary":"Genetic drift (allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect)[1] is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms.[2] The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form.[3]","image":"Darwin's_finches_by_Gould.jpg.webp"}
