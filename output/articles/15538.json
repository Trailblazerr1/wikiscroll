{"title":"Exponential function","summary":"The exponential function is a mathematical function denoted by f ( x ) = exp ⁡ ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)=\\exp(x)} or e x {\\displaystyle e^{x}} (where the argument x is written as an exponent). It can be defined in several equivalent ways. Its ubiquitous occurrence in pure and applied mathematics has led mathematician W. Rudin to opine that the exponential function is \"the most important function in mathematics\".[1] Its value at 1, e = exp ⁡ ( 1 ) , {\\displaystyle e=\\exp(1),} is a mathematical constant called Euler's number.","image":"9dd9b17af32bc3cffe927507c7bccf4e2a96f585.svg","url":"Exponential_function"}
