{"title":"Tirana","summary":"Tirana[lower-alpha 3] (/tɪˈrɑːnə/ (listen) tih-RAH-nə,[8][9] Albanian: [tiˈɾana]; Gheg Albanian: Tirona) is the capital and largest city of Albania. It is located in the centre of the country, enclosed by mountains and hills with Dajti rising to the east and a slight valley to the northwest overlooking the Adriatic Sea in the distance. Due to its location at the Plain of Tirana and the close proximity to the Mediterranean Sea, the city is particularly influenced by a Mediterranean seasonal climate. It is among the wettest and sunniest cities in Europe, with 2,544 hours of sun per year.[10][11]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
