{"title":"Nile tilapia","summary":"The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is a species of tilapia, a cichlid fish native to the northern half of Africa and the Levante area, including Israel, and Lebanon.[2] Numerous introduced populations exist outside its natural range.[1][3] It is also commercially known as mango fish, nilotica, or boulti.[4] The first name leads to easy confusion with another tilapia which is traded commercially, the mango tilapia (Sarotherodon galilaeus).","image":"Til√°pia_ou_Sarotherodon_niloticus_2.jpg.webp","url":"Nile_tilapia"}
