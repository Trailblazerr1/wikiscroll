{"title":"Robert Mapplethorpe","summary":"Robert Michael Mapplethorpe (/ˈmeɪpəlˌθɔːrp/; November 4, 1946 – March 9, 1989) was an American photographer, best known for his black-and-white photographs. His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female nudes, self-portraits, and still-life images. His most controversial works documented and examined the gay male BDSM subculture of New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A 1989 exhibition of Mapplethorpe's work, titled Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment, sparked a debate in the United States concerning both use of public funds for \"obscene\" artwork and the Constitutional limits of free speech in the United States.","image":"Robert_Mapplethorpe%2C_Self-portrait%2C_1980.jpg.webp","url":"Robert_Mapplethorpe"}
