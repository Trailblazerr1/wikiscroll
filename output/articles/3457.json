{"title":"Analytical psychology","summary":"Analytical psychology (German: Analytische Psychologie, sometimes translated as analytic psychology and referred to as Jungian analysis) is a term coined by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, to describe research into his new \"empirical science\" of the psyche. It was designed to distinguish it from Freud's psychoanalytic theories as their seven-year collaboration on psychoanalysis was drawing to an end between 1912 and 1913.[1][2][3] The evolution of his science is contained in his monumental opus, the Collected Works, written over sixty years of his lifetime.[4]","image":"lossy-page1-263px-ETH-BIB-Jung%2C_Carl_Gustav_(1875-1961)-Portrait-Portr_14163_(cropped).tif.jpg.webp"}
