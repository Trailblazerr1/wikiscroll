{"title":"Zooplankton","summary":"Zooplankton (/ˈzoʊ.əplæŋktən/;[1] /ˌzoʊ.əˈplæŋktən/)[2] are heterotrophic (sometimes detritivorous) plankton (cf. phytoplankton). Plankton are organisms drifting in oceans, seas, and bodies of fresh water. The word zooplankton is derived from the Greek zoon (ζῴον), meaning \"animal\", and planktos (πλαγκτός), meaning \"wanderer\" or \"drifter\".[3] Individual zooplankton are usually microscopic, but some (such as jellyfish) are larger and visible to the naked eye.","image":"Mixed_zooplankton_sample.jpg.webp","url":"Zooplankton"}
