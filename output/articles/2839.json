{"title":"Alfa Romeo","summary":"Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. (Italian: [ˈalfa roˈmɛːo]) is an Italian premium car manufacturer and a subsidiary of Stellantis. The company was founded on 24 June 1910, in Milan, Italy. \"Alfa\" is an acronym of its founding name, \"Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili.\" \"Anonima\" means \"anonymous\", which was a legal form of company at the time, as it was founded by anonymous investors. In the initial set-up phase, in order to have a building to produce cars, the company bought the Portello factory building of Darracq in Milan, which was closing up and selling all its assets.[2] The brand is known for sport-oriented vehicles and has been involved in car racing since 1911. Alfa Romeo was owned by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the company that was responsible for the production of Alfa Romeo cars until its operations were fully merged with those of the PSA Group to form Stellantis on 16 January 2021.","image":"Alfa_Romeo_logo.png.webp"}
