{"title":"Gilgamesh","summary":"Gilgamesh (Akkadian: ð’€­ð’„‘ð’‰‹ð’‚µð’ˆ¨ð’Œ‹ð’Œ‹ð’Œ‹, romanized:Â GilgameÅ¡; originally Sumerian: ð’€­ð’‰‹ð’‚µð’ˆ©, romanized:Â Bilgames or Pabilga-mes)[7][lower-alpha 1] was a hero in ancient Mesopotamian mythology and the protagonist of the Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem written in Akkadian during the late 2nd millennium BC. He was possibly a historical king of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, who was posthumously deified. His rule probably would have taken place sometime in the beginning of the Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia) (henceforth ED), c. 2900 â€“ 2350 BC, though he became a major figure in Sumerian legend during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c.â€‰2112Â â€“ c.â€‰2004 BC).","image":"Hero_lion_Dur-Sharrukin_Louvre_AO19862.jpg.webp"}
