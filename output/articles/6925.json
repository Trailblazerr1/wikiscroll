{"title":"Block cipher","summary":"In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks. They are specified elementary components in the design of many cryptographic protocols and are widely used to implement the encryption of large amounts of data, including data exchange protocols. It uses blocks as an unvarying transformation.","image":"5b31475fdb673accce5f96473066ef97c79082a6.svg","url":"Block_cipher"}
