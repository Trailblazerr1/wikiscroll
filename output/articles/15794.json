{"title":"Far-sightedness","summary":"Far-sightedness, also known as long-sightedness, hypermetropia, or hyperopia, is a condition of the eye where distant objects are seen clearly but near objects appear blurred. This blurred effect is due to incoming light being focused behind, instead of on, the retina wall due to insufficient accommodation by the lens.[6] Minor hypermetropia in young patients is usually corrected by their accommodation, without any defects in vision.[2] But, due to this accommodative effort for distant vision, people may complain of asthenopic symptoms during prolonged reading.[2] Some hypermetropes can see clear at distance, but near vision may be blurred due to insufficient accommodation. For this reason, this defect is referred as far-sightedness.[7]  If the hypermetropia is high, there will be defective vision for both distance and near.[2] People may also experience accommodative dysfunction, binocular dysfunction, amblyopia, and strabismus.[3] Newborns are almost invariably hypermetropic, but it gradually decreases as the newborn gets older.[6]","image":"Hypermetropia_color.svg.png.webp","url":"Far-sightedness"}
