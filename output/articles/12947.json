{"title":"Diethylstilbestrol","summary":"Diethylstilbestrol (DES), also known as stilbestrol or stilboestrol, is a nonsteroidal estrogen medication, which is presently rarely used.[5][6][7] In the past, it was widely used for a variety of indications, including pregnancy support for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage, hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and estrogen deficiency in women, treatment of prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women, and other uses.[5] By 2007, it was only used in the treatment of prostate cancer and breast cancer.[8] In 2011, Hoover and colleagues reported on adverse health outcomes linked to DES including infertility, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, infant death, menopause prior to age 45, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and vaginal cancer.[9] In 2020 the GoodRx and Walgreens' sites do not list diethylstilbestrol.[10][11] While most commonly taken by mouth, DES was available for use by other routes as well, for instance, vaginal, topical, and by injection.","image":"Diethylstilbestrol.svg.png.webp"}
