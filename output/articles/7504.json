{"title":"Breastfeeding","summary":"Breastfeeding, or nursing, is the process by which human breast milk is fed to an infant.[1] Human breast milk may be fed to infants directly from the breast, or may be expressed by hand or pumped and fed to the infant. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.[2][3][4] The baby should be given the opportunity to breastfeed as early as possible within the first hour of life, termed the Golden Hour, and breastfeeding should occur at least 8-12 times per day, or more frequently as desired by the infant.[5][6][7]: 17, 30–31  Feedings may last as long as 30–45 minutes each as milk supply develops and the infant learns the Suck-Swallow-Breathe pattern.[7]: 50–51   However, as milk supply increases and the infant becomes more efficient at feeding, duration of feeds may shorten.[7]: 50–51  Older children may feed less often.[8] Mothers should hand express or pump breastmilk when breastfeeding is not possible for many reasons, including emptying the breasts to prevent plugged milk ducts and breast infection, maintaining milk supply, resolving engorgement and so milk can be fed to infant at a later time.[1][9][10][7]: 55, 63–67","image":"Breastfeeding_infant.jpg.webp"}
