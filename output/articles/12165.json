{"title":"Dave Arneson","summary":"David Lance Arneson (/ˈɑːrnɪsən/; October 1, 1947[2] – April 7, 2009) was an American game designer best known for co-developing the first published role-playing game (RPG), Dungeons & Dragons, with Gary Gygax, in the early 1970s.[3] Arneson's early work was fundamental to the development of the genre, developing the concept of the RPG using devices now considered to be archetypical, such as adventuring in \"dungeons\" and using a neutral judge who doubles as the voice and consciousness of all characters aside from the player characters to develop the storyline.[4]","image":"Dave_Arneson.png.webp"}
