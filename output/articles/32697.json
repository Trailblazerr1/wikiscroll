{"title":"Oceanic dolphin","summary":"Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \"whale\" rather than \"dolphin\", such as the Globicephalinae (round-headed whales including the orca and pilot whale). Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea.","image":"PacificWhiteSidedDolphine.jpg.webp","url":"Oceanic_dolphin"}
