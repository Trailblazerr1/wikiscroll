{"title":"Drosophila melanogaster","summary":"Drosophila melanogaster is a species of fly (the taxonomic order Diptera) in the family Drosophilidae. The species is often referred to as the fruit fly or lesser fruit fly, or less commonly the \"vinegar fly\" or \"pomace fly\".[lower-alpha 1][4] Starting with Charles W. Woodworth's proposal of the use of this species as a model organism, D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and life history evolution. As of 2017, five Nobel Prizes have been awarded to drosophilists for their work using the animal.[5][6]","image":"Drosophila_melanogaster_Proboscis.jpg.webp"}
