{"title":"Limón","summary":"Limón (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈliˈmon]), commonly known as Puerto Limón,[1] is a district,[2][3] the capital city and main hub of Limón province, as well as of the Limón canton in Costa Rica. It is the seventh largest city in Costa Rica, with a population of over 55,000, and is home of the Afro-Costa Rican community.[4] Part of the community traces its roots to Italian, Jamaican and Chinese laborers who worked on a late nineteenth-century railroad project that connected San José to Puerto Limón. Until 1948, the Costa Rican government did not recognize Afro-Caribbean people as citizens and restricted their movement outside Limón province.[5] As a result of this \"travel ban\", this Afro-Caribbean population became firmly established in the region, which influenced decisions not to move even after it was legally permitted. Nowadays, there is a significant outflow of Limón natives who move to the country's Central Valley in search for better employment and education.[6] The Afro-Caribbean community speaks Spanish and Limonese Creole, a creole of English.","image":"Limon_Costa_Rica_-_Panoramic_view.png.webp"}
