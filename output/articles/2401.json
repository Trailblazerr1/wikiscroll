{"title":"Agent Orange","summary":"Agent Orange is a herbicide and defoliant chemical, one of the \"tactical use\" Rainbow Herbicides. It is widely known for its use by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand,[1] during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971.[2] It is a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D. In addition to its damaging environmental effects, traces of dioxin (mainly TCDD, the most toxic of its type)[3] found in the mixture have caused major health problems for many individuals who were exposed, and their offspring.","image":"US-Huey-helicopter-spraying-Agent-Orange-in-Vietnam.jpg.webp","url":"Agent_Orange"}
