{"title":"Chariot racing","summary":"Chariot racing (Greek: ἁρματοδρομία, translit. harmatodromia, Latin: ludi circenses) was one of the most popular ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine sports. Chariot racing was dangerous to both drivers and horses as they often suffered serious injury and even death. These dangers added to the excitement and interest for spectators. Chariot races could also be watched by women, who were banned from watching many other sports. In the ancient Olympic Games, as well as the other Panhellenic Games, the sport was one of the most important equestrian events. Each chariot held a single driver and was usually pulled by 4 horses.","image":"Puy-du-Fou-4.JPG.webp"}
