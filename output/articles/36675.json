{"title":"Quadrupedalism","summary":"Quadrupedalism  is a form of terrestrial locomotion where a tetrapod animal uses all four limbs (legs) to bear weight, walk, and run.  An animal or machine that usually maintains a four-legged posture and moves using all four limbs is said to be a quadruped (from Latin quattuor for \"four\", and pes, pedis for \"foot\").  Most quadrupeds are terrestrial vertebrates, including mammals and reptiles, though some are largely aquatic such as turtles, amphibians, and pinnipeds.","image":"Zebra_sideview.jpg.webp"}
