{"title":"Too Tough to Die","summary":"Too Tough to Die is the eighth studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones. It was released on October 1, 1984, and is the first Ramones record to feature Richie Ramone on drums. With ex-member Tommy Ramone producing, the recording process was similar to that of the band's 1976 self-titled debut album. Likewise, the record's style—both lyrically and compositionally—saw the band returning to their roots. The photograph on the album cover, which features silhouettes of the band members, resulted from a \"lucky accident\" after photographer George DuBose's camera malfunctioned.[1]","image":"Ramones_-_Too_Tough_to_Die_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Too_Tough_to_Die"}
