{"title":"Meningococcal disease","summary":"Meningococcal disease describes infections caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (also termed meningococcus). It has a high mortality rate if untreated but is vaccine-preventable. While best known as a cause of meningitis, it can also result in sepsis, which is an even more damaging and dangerous condition. Meningitis and meningococcemia are major causes of illness, death, and disability in both developed and under-developed countries.","image":"Charlotte_Cleverley-Bisman_Meningicoccal_Disease.jpg.webp"}
