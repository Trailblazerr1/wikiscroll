{"title":"Containerization","summary":"Containerization is a system of intermodal freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers and ISO containers).[1] The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is completely mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes[2] and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.","image":"Line3174_-_Shipping_Containers_at_the_terminal_at_Port_Elizabeth%2C_New_Jersey_-_NOAA.jpg.webp"}
