{"title":"Abbott and Costello","summary":"Abbott and Costello were an American comedy duo composed of comedians Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, whose work in radio, film, and television made them the most popular comedy team of the 1940s and early 1950s, and the highest-paid entertainers in the world during World War II. Their patter routine \"Who's on First?\" is considered one of the best-known comedy routines of all time.[1] Their popularity waned in the early 1950s due to overexposure and changing tastes in comedy, and their film and television contracts lapsed. The partnership ended soon afterwards.","image":"Abbott_and_Costello_circa_1940s.JPG.webp"}
