{"title":"Cerebral infarction","summary":"A cerebral infarction is the pathologic process that results in an area of necrotic tissue in the brain (cerebral infarct).[1] It is caused by disrupted blood supply (ischemia) and restricted oxygen supply (hypoxia), most commonly due to thromboembolism, and manifests clinically as ischemic stroke.[2] In response to ischemia, the brain degenerates by the process of liquefactive necrosis.[3]","image":"Infarction.svg.png.webp","url":"Cerebral_infarction"}
