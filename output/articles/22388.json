{"title":"Iowa-class battleship","summary":"The Iowa class was a class of six fast battleships ordered by the United States Navy in 1939 and 1940. They were initially intended to intercept fast capital ships such as the Japanese  Kongō class while also being capable of serving in a traditional battle line alongside slower battleships and act as its \"fast wing\".[2][3] The Iowa class was designed to meet the Second London Naval Treaty's \"escalator clause\" limit of 45,000-long-ton (45,700 t) standard displacement. Four vessels, Iowa, New Jersey, Missouri, and Wisconsin, were completed; two more, Illinois and Kentucky, were laid down but canceled in 1945 and 1958, respectively, before completion, and both hulls were scrapped in 1958–1959.","image":"BB61_USS_Iowa_BB61_broadside_USN.jpg.webp"}
