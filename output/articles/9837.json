{"title":"Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4","summary":"Christ lag in Todes Banden (also spelled Todesbanden;[lower-alpha 1] \"Christ lay in death's bonds\"[2] or \"Christ lay in the snares of death\"),[3] BWVÂ 4, is a cantata for Easter by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach, one of his earliest church cantatas. It is agreed to be an early work partly for stylistic reasons and partly because there is evidence that it was probably written for a performance in 1707. Bach went on to complete many other works in the same genre, contributing complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year. John Eliot Gardiner described it as Bach's \"first-known attempt at painting narrative in music\".[4]","image":"Christ_lag_in_Todesbanden_soprano-autograph_1724.png.webp"}
