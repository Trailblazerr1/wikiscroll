{"title":"Infertility","summary":"Infertility is the inability of a person, animal or plant to reproduce by natural means. It is usually not the natural state of a healthy adult, except notably among certain eusocial species (mostly haplodiploid insects). It is however the healthy state of a human child or other young offspring, for they have not yet undergone puberty, the body's start of reproductive capacity.","image":"IVF.jpg.webp"}
