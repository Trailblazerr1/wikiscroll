{"title":"Ex parte Crow Dog","summary":"Ex parte Crow Dog, 109 U.S. 556 (1883), is a landmark[1][2] decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that followed the death of one member of a Native American tribe at the hands of another on reservation land.[fn 1] Crow Dog was a member of the Brulé band of the Lakota Sioux. On August 5, 1881 he shot and killed Spotted Tail, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to Sioux tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow Dog for murder in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang.","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp","url":"Ex_parte_Crow_Dog"}
