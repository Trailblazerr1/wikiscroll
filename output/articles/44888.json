{"title":"These Are the Voyages...","summary":"\"These Are the Voyages...\" is the series finale of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Enterprise. The 22nd episode of the fourth season and the 98th of the series overall, it first aired on the UPN network in the United States on May 13, 2005. \"These Are the Voyages...\" is a frame story in which the 22nd-century events of Star Trek: Enterprise are recounted in a 24th-century holodeck re-creation that is insinuated into the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"The Pegasus\", which aired eleven years before. The episode features guest stars Jonathan Frakes, Marina Sirtis, and Jeffrey Combs, as well as a voice cameo from Brent Spiner. Series creators Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who co-wrote the episode, conceived \"These Are the Voyages...\" as a valentine to Star Trek fans.","image":"Brannon_braga.jpg.webp"}
