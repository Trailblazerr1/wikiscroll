{"title":"Refractory","summary":"A refractory material or refractory is a material that is resistant to decomposition by heat, pressure, or chemical attack, and retains strength and form at high temperatures.[1] Refractories are polycrystalline, polyphase, inorganic, non-metallic, porous, and heterogeneous. They are typically composed of oxides or carbides, nitrides etc. of the following materials: silicon, aluminium, magnesium, calcium, and zirconium.[2] Some metals with melting points >1850 °C like niobium, chromium, zirconium, tungsten, rhenium, tantalum, molybdenum etc. are also considered refractories.[3]","image":"Torpedo_car_refractory_bricks.JPG.webp"}
