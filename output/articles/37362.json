{"title":"Red-bellied piranha","summary":"The red-bellied piranha, also known as the red piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), is a species of piranha native to South America, found in the Amazon, Paraguay, Paran√° and Essequibo basins, as well as coastal rivers of northeastern Brazil.[1][2] This fish is locally abundant in its freshwater habitat.[3]  They are omnivorous foragers and feed on insects, worms, crustaceans and fish. They are not a migratory species, but do travel to seek out conditions conducive to breeding and spawning during periods of increased rainfall. Red-bellied piranhas often travel in shoals as a predatory defense, but rarely exhibit group hunting behavior. Acoustic communication is common, and is sometimes exhibited along with aggressive behaviors. Through media influence, the red-bellied piranha has developed a reputation as a ferocious predator, though this is not actually the case. They are a popular aquarium fish.","image":"Pygocentrus_nattereri_-_Karlsruhe_Zoo_01.jpg.webp"}
