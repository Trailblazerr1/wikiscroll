{"title":"Kingdom of Great Britain","summary":"The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially called Great Britain,[1] was a sovereign state in Western Europe from 1 May 1707[2] to 31 December 1800. The state was created by the 1706 Treaty of Union and ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England (which included Wales) and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands, with the exception of the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament at the Palace of Westminster, but distinct legal systems – English law and Scots law – remained in use. The union laid the foundation for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.","image":"Flag_of_Great_Britain_(1707–1800).svg.png.webp"}
