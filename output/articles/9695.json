{"title":"Chinese classifier","summary":"The modern Chinese varieties make frequent use of what are called classifiers or measure words. One use of classifiers is when a noun is qualified by a numeral known as a noun phrase. When a phrase such as \"one person\" or \"three books\" is translated into Chinese, it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate classifier between the numeral and the noun. For example, in Standard Mandarin,[note 1] the first of these phrases would be 一个人 yí gè rén, where yī means \"one\",[note 2] rén means \"person\", and gè is the required classifier. There are also other grammatical contexts in which classifiers are used, including after the demonstratives 这 (這) zhè (\"this\") and 那 nà (\"that\"); however, when a noun stands alone without any such qualifier, no classifier is needed. There are also various other uses of classifiers: for example, when placed after a noun rather than before it, or when repeated, a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity.","image":"Unicode500B.svg.png.webp"}
