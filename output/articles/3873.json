{"title":"Antenna (radio)","summary":"In radio engineering, an antenna or aerial is the interface between radio waves propagating through space and electric  currents moving in metal conductors, used with a transmitter or receiver.[1] In transmission, a radio transmitter supplies an electric current to the antenna's terminals, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). In reception, an antenna intercepts some of the power of a radio wave in order to produce an electric current at its terminals, that is applied to a receiver to be amplified.  Antennas are essential components of all radio equipment.[2]","image":"Antenna.jpg.webp"}
