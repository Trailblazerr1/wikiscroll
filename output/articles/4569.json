{"title":"Asa Gray","summary":"Asa Gray ForMemRS (November 18, 1810 â€“ January 30, 1888) is considered the most important American botanist of the 19th century.[1][2] His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution. He was a strong supporter of Darwin, although Gray's theistic evolution was guided by a Creator.","image":"Asa_Gray_1870s.jpg.webp","url":"Asa_Gray"}
