{"title":"Euro coins","summary":"There are eight euro coin denominations, ranging from one cent to two euros[1] (the euro is divided into a hundred cents). The coins first came into use in 1999. They have a common reverse, portraying a map of Europe, but each country in the eurozone has its own design on the obverse, which means that each coin has a variety of different designs in circulation at once. Four European microstates that are not members of the European Union (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City) use the euro as their currency and also have the right to mint coins with their own designs on the obverse side.","image":"1_cent_euro_coin_common_side.gif","url":"Euro_coins"}
