{"title":"Super Mario Odyssey","summary":"Super Mario Odyssey[lower-alpha 2] is a 2017 platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch video game console. An entry in the Super Mario series, it follows Mario and his new ally Cappy—a sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects—as they journey across various kingdoms to save Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser's plans of forced marriage. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, 3D platform gameplay featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.[1]","image":"Super_Mario_Odyssey.jpg.webp"}
