{"title":"Lignite","summary":"Lignite, often referred to as brown coal,[1] is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat. It has a carbon content around 25â€“35%,[1][2] and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content. Lignite is mined all around the world and is used almost exclusively as a fuel for steam-electric power generation.","image":"Lignite-coal.jpg.webp"}
