{"title":"S-box","summary":"In cryptography, an S-box (substitution-box) is a basic component of symmetric key algorithms which performs substitution. In block ciphers, they are typically used to obscure the relationship between the key and the ciphertext, thus ensuring Shannon's property of confusion. Mathematically, an S-box is a vectorial Boolean function.[1]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"S-box"}
