{"title":"Agkistrodon piscivorus","summary":"Agkistrodon piscivorus is a species of pit viper in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. It is the world's only semiaquatic viper, and is native to the southeastern United States.[3] As an adult, it is large and capable of delivering a painful and potentially fatal bite. When threatened, it may respond by coiling its body and displaying its fangs.[4] Individuals may bite when feeling threatened or being handled in any way.[5] It occurs in or near water, particularly in slow-moving and shallow lakes, streams, and marshes. It is a capable swimmer and, like several species of snakes, is known to occasionally enter bays and estuaries and swim between barrier islands and the mainland.[6]:â€Š211 p.","image":"Florida_Water_Moccasin_056.jpg.webp","url":"Agkistrodon_piscivorus"}
