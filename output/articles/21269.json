{"title":"Hygroscopy","summary":"Hygroscopy is the phenomenon of attracting and holding water molecules via either absorption  or adsorption from the surrounding environment, which is usually at normal or room temperature. If water molecules become suspended among the substance's molecules, adsorbing substances can become physically changed, e.g., changing in volume, boiling point, viscosity or some other physical characteristic or property of the substance.","image":"lossy-page1-220px-THC_2003.902.036_Determining_Hygroscopicity.tif.jpg.webp"}
