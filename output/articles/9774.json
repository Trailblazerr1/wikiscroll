{"title":"Choline","summary":"Choline /ˈkoʊliːn/[3] is an essential nutrient for humans and many other animals.[4] Choline occurs as a cation that forms various salts (X− in the depicted formula is an undefined counteranion).[5] To maintain health, it must be obtained from the diet as choline or as choline phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine.[4] Humans, as well as most other animal species, do make choline de novo, however production is generally insufficient. Choline is often not classified as a vitamin, but as a nutrient with an amino acid–like metabolism.[2] In most animals, choline phospholipids are necessary components in cell membranes, in the membranes of cell organelles, and in very low-density lipoproteins.[4] Choline is required to produce acetylcholine – a neurotransmitter – and S-adenosylmethionine, a universal methyl donor involved in the synthesis of homocysteine.[4]","image":"Choline-skeletal.svg.png.webp"}
