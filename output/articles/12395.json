{"title":"December to Dismember (2006)","summary":"The 2006 December to Dismember was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held primarily for wrestlers from the promotion's ECW brand division and was WWE's only PPV to be ECW-exclusive. The event took place on December 3, 2006, at the James Brown Arena in Augusta, Georgia. Despite it being an ECW-branded pay-per-view, some wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands also worked the show. It was the second and final event in the December to Dismember chronology, after the original 1995 event that was held by the former Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion; WWE acquired the assets of Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2003 and launched their own ECW brand in May 2006.","image":"ECWdectodismember2006.jpg.webp","url":"December_to_Dismember_(2006)"}
