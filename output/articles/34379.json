{"title":"Pension","summary":"A pension (/ˈpɛnʃən/, from Latin pensiō, \"payment\") is a fund into which a sum of money is added during an employee's employment years and from which payments are drawn to support the person's retirement from work in the form of periodic payments. A pension may be a \"defined benefit plan\", where a fixed sum is paid regularly to a person, or a \"defined contribution plan\", under which a fixed sum is invested that then becomes available at retirement age.[1] Pensions should not be confused with severance pay; the former is usually paid in regular amounts for life after retirement, while the latter is typically paid as a fixed amount after involuntary termination of employment before retirement.","image":"Coin_of_Maximian.jpg.webp"}
