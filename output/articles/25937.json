{"title":"Lepton","summary":"In particle physics, a lepton is an elementary particle of half-integer spin (spin 1‚ÅÑ2) that does not undergo strong interactions.[1] Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons (also known as the electron-like leptons or muons), and neutral leptons (better known as neutrinos). Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed.  The best known of all leptons is the electron.","image":"Beta_Negative_Decay.svg.png.webp","url":"Lepton"}
