{"title":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid","summary":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is an aminopolycarboxylic acid with the formula [CH2N(CH2CO2H)2]2. This white, water-soluble solid is widely used to bind to iron and calcium ions. It binds these ions as a hexadentate (\"six-toothed\") chelating agent. EDTA is produced as several salts, notably disodium EDTA, sodium calcium edetate, and tetrasodium EDTA.[4]","image":"EDTA.svg.png.webp","url":"Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid"}
