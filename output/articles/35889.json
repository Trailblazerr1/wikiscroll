{"title":"President of Croatia","summary":"The president of Croatia, officially denoted as the President of the Republic of Croatia (Croatian: Predsjednik / Predsjednica Republike Hrvatske), is the head of state, commander-in-chief of the military and chief representative of the Republic of Croatia both within the country and abroad. The president is the holder of the highest office in Croatia. However, the president is not the head of the executive branch (\"non executive president\") as Croatia has a parliamentary system in which the holder of the post of prime minister is the most powerful person within the country's constitutional framework and everyday politics.","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_the_President_of_Croatia.svg.png.webp"}
