{"title":"Armillary sphere","summary":"An armillary sphere (variations are known as spherical astrolabe, armilla, armil, or huntianyi (traditional Chinese: 渾天儀; simplified Chinese: 浑天仪) is a model of objects in the sky (on the celestial sphere), consisting of a spherical framework of rings, centered on Earth or the Sun, that represent lines of celestial longitude and latitude and other astronomically important features, such as the ecliptic. As such, it differs from a celestial globe, which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the constellations. It was invented separately in ancient China first in 4th century BC and ancient Greece in 3rd century BC, with later use in the Islamic world and Medieval Europe.","image":"Armillary_sphere_with_astronomical_clock.jpg.webp"}
