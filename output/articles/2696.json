{"title":"Album era","summary":"The album era was a period in English-language popular music from the mid-1960s to the mid-2000s in which the album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.[1][2] It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats: the 331⁄3 rpm long-playing record (LP), the audiocassette, and the compact disc. Rock musicians from the US and the UK were often at the forefront of the era, which is sometimes called the album-rock era in reference to their sphere of influence and activity. The term \"album era\" is also used to refer to the marketing and aesthetic period surrounding a recording artist's album release.","image":"Year_music.svg.png.webp","url":"Album_era"}
