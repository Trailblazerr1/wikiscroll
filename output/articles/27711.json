{"title":"Lysergic acid diethylamide","summary":"Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD),[lower-alpha 1] also known colloquially as acid, is a psychedelic drug.[11] Effects typically include intensified thoughts, emotions, and sensory perception.[12] At sufficiently high dosages LSD manifests primarily visual, as well as auditory, hallucinations.[13][14] Dilated pupils, increased blood pressure, and increased body temperature are typical.[15] Since LSD binds to dopamine receptors in addition to serotonin receptors its effects are also more energetic and fast paced compared to psychedelics such as psilocybin, which is not a dopamine agonist.[16] Effects typically begin within half an hour and can last for up to 20 hours.[15][17] LSD is also capable of occasioning mystical experiences and ego dissolution, albeit less frequently than compounds such as psilocybin.[18][14] It is used mainly as a recreational drug or for spiritual reasons.[15][19] LSD is both the prototypical psychedelic and one of the 'classical' psychedelics, being the psychedelics with the greatest scientific and cultural significance.[11]","image":"Lysergs√§urediethylamid_(LSD).svg.png.webp"}
