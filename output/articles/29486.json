{"title":"Metallica discography","summary":"The discography of Metallica includes ten studio albums, eight live albums, three extended plays, 43 singles, ten video albums, 42 music videos, one soundtrack album, one collaboration album and three box sets. They are a San Francisco-based metal band formed in 1981 by James Hetfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Lars Ulrich (drums). After several bassist and lead guitarist changes (including Dave Mustaine), the band settled on Cliff Burton and Kirk Hammett, respectively. Metallica started playing locally, releasing their first widely circulated demo, No Life 'til Leather, in 1982. The demo caught the attention of Johny Zazula, who signed Metallica to Megaforce Records.[1] The band released Kill 'Em All in 1983, and the following year they released Ride the Lightning. After Ride the Lightning was released, Metallica left Megaforce and signed to Elektra Records.[2] In March 1986, the band released its third studio album, Master of Puppets, which was Metallica's first album to be certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[3] While promoting the album, Burton was killed in a bus accident. Jason Newsted was hired as a replacement. The band's first release to feature the new member was The $5.98 E.P. – Garage Days Re-Revisited, and then followed by ...And Justice for All in August 1988, which peaked at number six on the Billboard 200.[4]","image":"Metallica_at_The_O2_Arena_London_2008.jpg.webp","url":"Metallica_discography"}
