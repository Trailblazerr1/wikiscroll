{"title":"Dusty Springfield","summary":"Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien OBE[1] (16 April 1939 – 2 March 1999), known professionally as Dusty Springfield, was an English singer whose career spanned over five decades. With her distinctive mezzo-soprano sound, she was a significant singer of blue-eyed soul, pop and dramatic ballads, with French chanson, country, and jazz also in her repertoire. During her 1960s peak, she ranked among the most successful British female performers on both sides of the Atlantic. Her image – marked by a peroxide blonde bouffant/beehive hairstyle, heavy makeup (thick black eyeliner and eye shadow) and  evening gowns, as well as stylised, gestural performances – made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties.[2]","image":"Dusty_Springfield_(1966)b.png.webp","url":"Dusty_Springfield"}
