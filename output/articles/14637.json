{"title":"Elysium","summary":"Elysium or the Elysian Fields (Ancient Greek: Ἠλύσιον πεδίον, Ēlýsion pedíon) is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time and was maintained by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults. It was initially separated from the Greek underworld and realm of Hades, and only mortals related to the gods and other heroes could be admitted here. Later, the conception of who could enter was expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic. They would remain at the Elysian Fields after death, to live a blessed and happy life, and indulge in whatever employment they had enjoyed in life.[1][2][3][4][5][6]","image":"Goethe_Elysium_crop.jpg.webp"}
