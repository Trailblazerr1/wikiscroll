{"title":"Bract","summary":"In botany, a bract is a modified or specialized leaf, especially one associated with a reproductive structure such as a flower, inflorescence axis or cone scale. Bracts are often (but not always) different from foliage leaves. They may be smaller, larger, or of a different color, shape, or texture. Typically, they also look different from the parts of the flower, such as the petals or sepals. A plant having bracts is referred to as bracteate[1] or bracteolate, while one that lacks them is referred to as ebracteate[2] and ebracteolate, without bracts.","image":"Yellow-rattle_close_700.jpg.webp"}
