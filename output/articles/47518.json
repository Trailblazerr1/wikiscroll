{"title":"Virgo (astrology)","summary":"Virgo (♍︎) (Greek: Παρθένος, Parthenos) is the sixth astrological sign in the Zodiac. It spans the 150–180th degree of the zodiac. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this area on average between August 23 and September 22,[2] and the Sun transits the constellation  Virgo from approximately September 16 to October 30.[3] Individuals born during these dates, depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, may be called Virgos or Virgoans;[4] they are also represented in newspaper horoscopes with other astrological signs.[5] The symbol of the maiden is based on Astraea. In Greek mythology, she was the last immortal to abandon Earth at the end of the Silver Age, when the gods fled to Olympus – hence the sign's association with Earth.[6]","image":"Virgo_symbol_(Moskowitz%2C_fixed_width).svg.png.webp","url":"Virgo_(astrology)"}
