{"title":"History of Gibraltar","summary":"The history of Gibraltar, a small peninsula on the southern Iberian coast near the entrance of the Mediterranean Sea, spans over 2,900 years. The peninsula has evolved from a place of reverence in ancient times into \"one of the most densely fortified and fought-over places in Europe\",[1] as one historian has put it. Gibraltar's location has given it an outsized significance in the history of Europe and its fortified town, established in the Middle Ages, has hosted garrisons that sustained numerous sieges and battles over the centuries.","image":"John_Mace_-_North_View_of_Gibraltar_from_Spanish_Lines.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_Gibraltar"}
