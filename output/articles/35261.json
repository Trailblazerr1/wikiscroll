{"title":"Plug-in electric vehicle","summary":"A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV), also known as new energy vehicles (NEV) is any road vehicle that can be recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of electric vehicles that includes all-electric, or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs).[3][4][5] Sales of the first mass-production plug-in cars began in December 2008, with the introduction of the BYD F3DM, before gaining more traction in December 2010 due to the introduction of the all-electric Nissan Leaf and the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt.","image":"Tesla_Model_3_DCA_08_2018_0275.jpg.webp"}
