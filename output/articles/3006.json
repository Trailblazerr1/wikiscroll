{"title":"Alligator gar","summary":"The alligator gar (Atractosteus spatula) is a ray-finned euryhaline fish related to the bowfin in the infraclass Holostei /hoʊˈlɒstiaɪ/. It is the largest species in the gar family, and among the largest freshwater fish in North America. The fossil record traces its group's existence back to the Early Cretaceous over 100 million years ago. Gars are often referred to as \"primitive fishes\", or \"living fossils\" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors, such as a spiral valve intestine, which is also common to the digestive system of sharks, and the ability to breathe both air and water.  Their common name was derived from their resemblance to  the American alligator, particularly their broad snouts and long, sharp teeth.  Anecdotal evidence  suggests that an alligator gar can grow up to 10 ft (3.0 m) in length.","image":"Alligator_Gar_10.JPG.webp"}
