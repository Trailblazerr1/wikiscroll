{"title":"Equivalence principle","summary":"In the theory of general relativity, the equivalence principle is the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass, and Albert Einstein's observation that the gravitational \"force\" as experienced locally while standing on a massive body (such as the Earth) is the same as the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial (accelerated) frame of reference.","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp"}
