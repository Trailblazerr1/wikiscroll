{"title":"Genome-wide association study","summary":"In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), also known as whole genome association study (WGA study, or WGAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.","image":"Manhattan_plot_from_a_GWAS_of_kidney_stone_disease.png.webp","url":"Genome-wide_association_study"}
