{"title":"Cyathus","summary":"Cyathus is a genus of fungi in the Nidulariaceae, a family collectively known as the bird's nest fungi. They are given this name since they resemble tiny bird's nests filled with \"eggs\", structures large enough to have been mistaken in the past for seeds. However, these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores. The \"eggs\", or peridioles, are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus. The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries, although a few exist in only one or two locales. Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries. Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups, which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open-cup fruit body. The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally (referred to as plicate or striate); this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species.","image":"2012-10-22_Cyathus_striatus_(Huds.)_Willd_274333_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Cyathus"}
