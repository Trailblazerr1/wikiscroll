{"title":"New school hip hop","summary":"The new school of hip hop was a movement in hip hop music beginning 1983–84 with the early records of Run–D.M.C. and LL Cool J. Like the preceding hip hop, it came predominantly from New York City. The new school was characterized by drum machine led minimalism, often tinged with elements of rock. It comprised rapping taunts, boasts, and socio-political commentary delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In song and image its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with funk and disco, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent in the early 1980s, thus rendering them old school. New school artists crafted shorter songs more amenable to airplay, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish hip hop as a fixture of the mainstream.","image":"KRS-One_crop.jpg.webp","url":"New_school_hip_hop"}
