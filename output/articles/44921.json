{"title":"Third Amendment to the United States Constitution","summary":"The Third Amendment (Amendment III) to the United States Constitution places restrictions on the quartering of soldiers in private homes without the owner's consent, forbidding the practice in peacetime. The amendment is a response to the Quartering Acts passed by the British parliament during the buildup to the American Revolutionary War, which had allowed the British Army to lodge soldiers in private residences.","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp"}
