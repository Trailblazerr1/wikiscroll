{"title":"Pad thai","summary":"Pad thai, phat thai, or phad thai (/ˌpɑːd ˈtaɪ/ or /ˌpæd ˈtaɪ/; Thai: ผัดไทย, RTGS: phat thai, ISO: p̄hạd thịy, pronounced [pʰàt tʰāj] (listen), 'Thai stir fry'), is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly served as a street food and at most restaurants in Thailand as part of the country's cuisine.[1][2] It is typically made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts, a scrambled egg, and bean sprouts, among other vegetables. The ingredients are fried in a wok. Once the dish is completed it is tossed in pad thai sauce, which gives the dish its signature tangy salty flavor with a hint of sweetness.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
