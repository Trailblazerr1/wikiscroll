{"title":"Propagation of uncertainty","summary":"In statistics, propagation of uncertainty (or propagation of error) is the effect of variables' uncertainties (or errors, more specifically random errors) on the uncertainty of a function based on them. When the variables are the values of experimental measurements they have uncertainties due to measurement limitations (e.g., instrument precision) which propagate due to the combination of variables in the function.","image":"a1f8e58e6fdb74b4c51c980b97919edaa108cf87.svg","url":"Propagation_of_uncertainty"}
