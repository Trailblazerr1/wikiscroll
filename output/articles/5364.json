{"title":"Baháʼí Faith and the unity of humanity","summary":"Unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Baháʼí Faith.[1] The Baháʼí teachings state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people regardless of race or colour.[2] Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment.[1] Thus the Baháʼí view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.[2] The teaching, however, does not equal unity with uniformity, but instead the Baháʼí writings advocate for the principle of unity in diversity where the variety in the human race is valued.[3]","image":"Bahai_star.svg.png.webp"}
