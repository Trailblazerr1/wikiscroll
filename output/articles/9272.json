{"title":"Chardonnay","summary":"Chardonnay (UK: /ˈʃɑːrdəneɪ/, US: /ˌʃɑːrdənˈeɪ/,[1][2] French: [ʃaʁdɔnɛ] (listen)) is a green-skinned grape variety used in the production of white wine.  The variety originated in the Burgundy wine region of eastern France, but is now grown wherever wine is produced, from England to New Zealand. For new and developing wine regions, growing Chardonnay is seen as a 'rite of passage' and an easy entry into the international wine market.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
