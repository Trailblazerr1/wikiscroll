{"title":"Binoculars","summary":"Binoculars or field glasses are two refracting telescopes mounted side-by-side and aligned to point in the same direction, allowing the viewer to use both eyes (binocular vision) when viewing distant objects. Most binoculars are sized to be held using both hands, although sizes vary widely from opera glasses to large pedestal-mounted military models.","image":"2020_Lornetka_Baigish_8x30.jpg.webp","url":"Binoculars"}
