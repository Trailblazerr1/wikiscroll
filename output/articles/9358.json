{"title":"Charles VIII of France","summary":"Charles VIII, called the Affable (French: l'Affable; 30 June 1470 – 7 April 1498), was King of France from 1483 to his death in 1498. He succeeded his father Louis XI at the age of 13.[1] His elder sister Anne acted as regent jointly with her husband Peter II, Duke of Bourbon[1][2] until 1491 when the young king turned 21 years of age. During Anne's regency, the great lords rebelled against royal centralisation efforts in a conflict known as the Mad War (1485–1488), which resulted in a victory for the royal government.","image":"Portrait_of_King_Charles_VIII_of_France_(1470–1498)%2C_by_anonymous_artist%2C_16th_century_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Charles_VIII_of_France"}
