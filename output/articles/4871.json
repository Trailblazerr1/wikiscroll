{"title":"Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford in Sacramento","summary":"On September 5, 1975, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a member of the Manson Family cult, attempted to assassinate United States president Gerald Ford in Sacramento, California. She wanted to make a statement to people who refused to halt environmental pollution and its effects on air, trees, water, and animals (ATWA). Although Fromme stood a little more than an arm's length from Ford that Friday morning and pointed a M1911 pistol at him in the public grounds of the California State Capitol building, she had not chambered a round, the gun did not fire, and no one was injured. After the assassination attempt, Ford continued to walk to the California state house, where he met with Governor Jerry Brown. For her crime, Fromme spent 34 years in prison and was released on August 14, 2009 â€“ two years and seven months after Ford's death. The Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, later received the M1911 pistol used in the assassination attempt as a gift, and the gun was put on display.","image":"Ford_rushed_from_Sacramento_assassination_attempt_image_A6320-23A.jpg.webp","url":"Attempted_assassination_of_Gerald_Ford_in_Sacramento"}
