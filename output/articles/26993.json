{"title":"List of solar eclipses in the 21st century","summary":"During the 21st century, there will be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 73 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central,[1] in the sense that the very center (axis) of the Moon's shadow will miss the Earth (for more information see gamma).[2] In the 21st century, the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.[1]","image":"Solar_eclipse.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_solar_eclipses_in_the_21st_century"}
