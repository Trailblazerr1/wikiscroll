{"title":"Guy Burgess","summary":"Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess (16 April 1911 â€“ 30 August 1963) was a British diplomat and Soviet agent, and a member of the Cambridge Five spy ring that operated from the mid-1930s to the early years of the Cold War era.[1] His defection in 1951 to the Soviet Union, with his fellow spy Donald Maclean, led to a serious breach in Anglo-United States intelligence co-operation, and caused long-lasting disruption and demoralisation in Britain's foreign and diplomatic services.","image":"SSburgess.jpg.webp"}
