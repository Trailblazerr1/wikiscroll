{"title":"Vegetable oil","summary":"Vegetable oils, or vegetable fats, are oils extracted from seeds or from other parts of fruits. Like animal fats, vegetable fats are mixtures of triglycerides.[1] Soybean oil, grape seed oil, and cocoa butter are examples of fats from seeds. Olive oil, palm oil, and rice bran oil are examples of fats from other parts of fruits. In common usage, vegetable oil may refer exclusively to vegetable fats which are liquid at room temperature.[2][3] Vegetable oils are usually edible; non-edible oils derived mainly from petroleum are termed mineral oils. Vegetable oil sold in the U.S. is normally synonymous with soybean oil.[4]","image":"Olive_oil_from_Oneglia.jpg.webp","url":"Vegetable_oil"}
