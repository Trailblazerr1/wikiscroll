{"title":"DDR3 SDRAM","summary":"Double Data Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DDR3 SDRAM) is a type of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) with a high bandwidth (\"double data rate\") interface, and has been in use since 2007.  It is the higher-speed successor to DDR and DDR2 and predecessor to DDR4 synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) chips.  DDR3 SDRAM is neither forward nor backward compatible with any earlier type of random-access memory (RAM) because of different signaling voltages, timings, and other factors.","image":"2013_Transcend_TS512MLK72V6N-(straightened).jpg.webp"}
