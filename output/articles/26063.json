{"title":"Libertarian Party (United States)","summary":"The Libertarian Party (LP) is a political party in the United States that promotes civil liberties, non-interventionism, laissez-faire capitalism, and limiting the size and scope of government. The party was conceived in August 1971 at meetings in the home of David F. Nolan in Westminster, Colorado,[9][10] and was officially formed on December 11, 1971, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.[10] The founding of the party was prompted in part due to concerns about the Nixon administration, the Vietnam War, conscription, and the introduction of fiat money.[11][12]","image":"Libertarian_Party_(United_States)_Banner_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Libertarian_Party_(United_States)"}
