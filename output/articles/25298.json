{"title":"Lachlan Macquarie","summary":"Major General Lachlan Macquarie, CB (/məˈkwɒrɪ/; Scottish Gaelic: Lachann MacGuaire; 31 January 1762 – 1 July 1824)[1] was a British Army officer and colonial administrator from Scotland. Macquarie served as the fifth and last autocratic Governor of New South Wales from 1810 to 1821,[2] and had a leading role in the social, economic, and architectural development of the colony. He is considered by historians to have had a crucial influence on the transition of New South Wales from a penal colony to a free settlement and therefore to have played a major role in the shaping of Australian society in the early nineteenth century.[3][4] In 1816 Macquarie gave orders that led to the Appin Massacre of Gundungurra and Dharawal people.[5][6][7]","image":"Ln-Governor-Lachlan_macquarie.jpg.webp","url":"Lachlan_Macquarie"}
