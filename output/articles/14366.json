{"title":"El Dorado","summary":"El Dorado (pronounced [el doˈɾaðo], English: /ˌɛl dəˈrɑːdoʊ/; Spanish for \"the golden one\"), originally El Hombre Dorado (\"The Golden Man\") or El Rey Dorado (\"The Golden King\"), was the term used by the Spanish in the 16th century to describe a mythical tribal chief (zipa) of the Muisca people, an indigenous people of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense of Colombia, who, as an initiation rite, covered himself with gold dust and submerged in Lake Guatavita. The legends surrounding El Dorado changed over time, as it went from being a man, to a city, to a kingdom, and then finally to an empire.","image":"Gold_Museum%2C_Bogota_(36145671394).jpg.webp","url":"El_Dorado"}
