{"title":"Palestinian National Authority","summary":"The Palestinian National Authority (PA or PNA; Arabic: السلطة الوطنية الفلسطينية‎ as-Sulṭa al-Waṭanīya al-Filasṭīnīya) is the Fatah-controlled, interim self-government body that exercises partial civil control over the Gaza Strip and West Bank areas \"A\" and \"B\",[1] established as a consequence of the 1993–1995 Oslo Accords.[4][5] Following elections in 2006 and the subsequent Gaza conflict between the Fatah and Hamas parties, its authority had extended only in areas A and B of the West Bank. Since January 2013, it has used the name \"State of Palestine\" on official documents (despite the actual State of Palestine being governed by the Palestine Liberation Organization).[6][7][8]","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_the_Palestinian_National_Authority.svg.png.webp","url":"Palestinian_National_Authority"}
