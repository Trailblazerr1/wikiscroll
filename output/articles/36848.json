{"title":"RIAA certification","summary":"In the United States, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) awards certification based on the number of albums and singles sold through retail and other ancillary markets.[1] Other countries have similar awards (see music recording certification). Certification is not automatic; for an award to be made, the record label must request certification.[2] The audit is conducted against net shipments after returns (most often an artist's royalty statement is used), which includes albums sold directly to retailers and  one-stops, direct-to-consumer sales (music clubs and mail order) and other outlets.","image":"Madonna_platinum_record_2.png.webp"}
