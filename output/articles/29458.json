{"title":"Messiah in Judaism","summary":"The Messiah in Judaism (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ‎, romanized: māšīyaḥ) is a savior and liberator figure in Jewish eschatology, who is believed to be the future redeemer of the Jewish people. The concept of messianism originated in Judaism,[1][2] and in the Hebrew Bible a messiah is a king or High Priest traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil.[3] However, messiahs were not exclusively Jewish, as the Hebrew Bible refers to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, as a messiah[4] for his decree to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple.","image":"Guide_for_the_Perplexed_by_Maimonides.jpg.webp","url":"Messiah_in_Judaism"}
