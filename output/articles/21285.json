{"title":"Hypercapnia","summary":"Hypercapnia (from the Greek hyper = \"above\" or \"too much\" and kapnos = \"smoke\"), also known as hypercarbia and CO2 retention, is a condition of abnormally elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood. Carbon dioxide is a gaseous product of the body's metabolism and is normally expelled through the lungs. Carbon dioxide may accumulate in any condition that causes hypoventilation, a reduction of alveolar ventilation (the clearance of air from the small sacs of the lung where gas exchange takes place) as well as resulting from inhalation of CO2. Inability of the lungs to clear carbon dioxide, or inhalation of elevated levels of CO2, leads to respiratory acidosis. Eventually the body compensates for the raised acidity by retaining alkali in the kidneys, a process known as \"metabolic compensation\".","image":"Main_symptoms_of_carbon_dioxide_toxicity.svg.png.webp"}
