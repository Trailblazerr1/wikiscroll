{"title":"Tocharians","summary":"The Tocharians, or Tokharians (US: /toʊˈkɛəriən/ or /toʊˈkɑːriən/;[5] UK: /tɒˈkɑːriən/),[6] were speakers of Tocharian languages, Indo-European languages known from around 7600 documents from around 400 to 1200 AD, found on the northern edge of the Tarim Basin (modern Xinjiang, China).[7]\nThe name \"Tocharian\" was given to these languages in the early 20th century by scholars who identified their speakers with a people known in ancient Greek sources as the Tókharoi (Latin Tochari), who inhabited Bactria from the 2nd century BC. This identification is generally considered erroneous, but the name \"Tocharian\" remains the most common term for the languages and their speakers.\nTheir actual ethnic name is unknown, although they may have referred to themselves as Agni, Kuči and Krorän, or Agniya, Kuchiya as known from Sanskrit texts.[8]","image":"Royal_family%2C_Cave_17%2C_Kizil_(family_detail%2C_retouched)%2C_Hermitage_Museum.jpg.webp"}
