{"title":"Hormone","summary":"A hormone (from the Greek participle ὁρμῶν, \"setting in motion\") is any member of a class of signaling molecules in multicellular organisms, that are transported to distant organs to regulate physiology and behavior.[1] Hormones are required for the correct development of animals, plants and fungi. The lax definition of a hormone (as a signalling molecule that acts distant from its site of production) means that many different classes of molecule can be defined as hormones. Among the substances that can be considered hormones, are eicosanoids (e.g. prostaglandins and thromboxanes), steroids (e.g. oestrogen and brassinosteroid), amino acid derivatives (e.g. epinephrine and auxin), protein / peptides (e.g. insulin and CLE peptides) and gases (e.g ethylene and nitrous oxide).","image":"Hormone_Transport.png.webp"}
