{"title":"Viola","summary":"The viola (/viˈoʊlə/ vee-OH-lə,[1][2] also UK: /vaɪˈoʊlə/ vy-OH-lə,[3][4][lower-alpha 1] Italian: [ˈvjɔːla, viˈɔːla]) is a string instrument that is bowed, plucked, or played with varying techniques. Slightly larger than a violin, it has a lower and deeper sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth above) and the cello (which is tuned an octave below).[5] The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4.","image":"Bratsche.jpg.webp"}
