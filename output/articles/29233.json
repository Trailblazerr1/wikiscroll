{"title":"Meghan Trainor discography","summary":"American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor has released four studio albums, two extended plays (EP), two live albums, 28 singles (including five as a featured artist), 24 music videos, three independent albums, and 15 promotional singles. She self-released the albums: Meghan Trainor (2009), I'll Sing with You (2011), and Only 17 (2011). These self-produced albums were pulled from circulation after she signed with Epic Records in February 2014.[1] Trainor's debut single, \"All About That Bass\", was released on June 30, 2014, and topped the Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks. The single became the longest-reigning number-one by an Epic recording artist in the United States, surpassing the seven-week record held by Michael Jackson's songs \"Billie Jean\" (1983) and \"Black or White\" (1991).[2] It topped the national charts of 58 countries and became one of the best-selling singles of all-time. As of 2015, it had sold over 11 million units internationally.[3] \"All About That Bass\" was certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and preceded Trainor's debut EP, Title (2014), which peaked at number 15 on the Billboard 200 in September 2014.[4][5]","image":"Meghan_Trainor_December_20(14).jpg.webp"}
