{"title":"Polymer","summary":"A polymer (/ˈpɒlɪmər/;[4][5] Greek poly-, \"many\" + -mer, \"part\") is a substance or material consisting of very large molecules, or macromolecules, composed of many repeating subunits.[6] Due to their broad spectrum of properties,[7] both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life.[8] Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass, relative to small molecule compounds, produces unique physical properties including toughness, high elasticity, viscoelasticity, and a tendency to form amorphous and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.","image":"Single_Polymer_Chains_AFM.jpg.webp","url":"Polymer"}
