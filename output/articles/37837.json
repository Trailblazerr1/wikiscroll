{"title":"Riboflavin","summary":"Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and sold as a dietary supplement.[3] It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, antibody production, and normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults.","image":"Riboflavin.svg.png.webp"}
