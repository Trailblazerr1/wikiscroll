{"title":"John Marshall Harlan","summary":"John Marshall Harlan (June 1, 1833 â€“ October 14, 1911) was an American lawyer and politician who served as an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. He is often called \"The Great Dissenter\" due to his many dissents in cases that restricted civil liberties, including the Civil Rights Cases and Plessy v. Ferguson. Many of Harlan's views expressed in his notable dissents would become the official view of the Supreme Court starting from the 1950s Warren Court and onward. His grandson John Marshall Harlan II was also a Supreme Court justice.","image":"JudgeJMHarlan.jpg.webp","url":"John_Marshall_Harlan"}
