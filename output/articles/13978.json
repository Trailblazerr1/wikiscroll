{"title":"Earthquake prediction","summary":"Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits,[1][lower-alpha 1] and particularly \"the determination of parameters for the next strong earthquake to occur in a region.[2] Earthquake prediction is sometimes distinguished from earthquake forecasting, which can be defined as the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[3][lower-alpha 2] Not all scientists distinguish \"prediction\" and \"forecast\", but it is useful.","image":"Alarm_dilemma.png.webp"}
