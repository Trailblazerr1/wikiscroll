{"title":"New Zealand Company","summary":"The New Zealand Company, chartered in the United Kingdom, was a company that existed in the first half of the 19th century on a business model focused on the systematic colonisation of New Zealand. The company was formed to carry out the principles devised by Edward Gibbon Wakefield, who envisaged the creation of a new-model English society in the southern hemisphere. Under Wakefield's model, the colony would attract capitalists who would then have a ready supply of labourâ€”migrant labourers who could not initially afford to be property owners, but who would have the expectation of one-day buying land with their savings.[1]","image":"New_Zealand_Company_Coat_of_Arms.jpg.webp","url":"New_Zealand_Company"}
