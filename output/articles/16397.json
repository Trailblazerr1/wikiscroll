{"title":"Flag of Scotland","summary":"The flag of Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: bratach na h-Alba;[1] Scots: Banner o Scotland, also known as St Andrew's Cross or the Saltire)[2] is the national flag of Scotland,[3] which consists of a white saltire defacing a blue field. The Saltire, rather than the Royal Standard of Scotland, is the correct flag for all private individuals and corporate bodies to fly.[4] It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8:00 am until sunset, with certain exceptions.[5]","image":"Flag_of_Scotland.svg.png.webp"}
