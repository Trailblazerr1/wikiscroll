{"title":"Fishing village","summary":"A fishing village is a village, usually located near a fishing ground, with an economy based on catching fish and harvesting seafood. The continents and islands around the world have coastlines totalling around 356,000 kilometres (221,000Â mi).[1] From Neolithic times, these coastlines, as well as the shorelines of inland lakes and the banks of rivers, have been punctuated with fishing villages. Most surviving fishing villages are traditional.","image":"FishingVillage_HaLongBay_Vietnam_(pixinn.net).jpg.webp"}
