{"title":"Thylacine","summary":"The thylacine (/ˈθaɪləsiːn/ THY-lə-seen,[14] or /ˈθaɪləsaɪn/ THY-lə-syne,[15] also /ˈθaɪləsɪn/)[16] (Thylacinus cynocephalus) is an extinct carnivorous marsupial that was native to the Australian mainland and the islands of Tasmania and New Guinea.[17] The last known live animal was captured in 1930 in Tasmania. It is commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the Tasmanian wolf (because of its canid-like characteristics). On the Australian mainland, it has been referred as the Nannup tiger.[18] Various Aboriginal Tasmanian names have been recorded, such as coorinna, kanunnah, cab-berr-one-nen-er, loarinna, laoonana, can-nen-ner and lagunta,[19][20] while kaparunin is used in the constructed language of Palawa kani.[21]","image":"Thylacinus.jpg.webp"}
