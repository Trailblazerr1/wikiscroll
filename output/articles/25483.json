{"title":"Languages of the Roman Empire","summary":"Latin and Greek were the official languages of the Roman Empire, but other languages were important regionally. Latin was the original language of the Romans and remained the language of imperial administration, legislation, and the military throughout the classical period.[2] In the West, it became the lingua franca and came to be used for even local administration of the cities including the law courts.[3][4] After all freeborn male inhabitants of the Empire were universally enfranchised in 212 AD, a great number of Roman citizens would have lacked Latin, though they were expected to acquire at least a token knowledge, and Latin remained a marker of \"Romanness\".[5]","image":"Bestiaires_festoyant_arène_Thysdrus_Musée_Bardo.JPG.webp","url":"Languages_of_the_Roman_Empire"}
