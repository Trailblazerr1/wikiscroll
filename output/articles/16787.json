{"title":"Fractional-reserve banking","summary":"Fractional-reserve banking is the system of banking operating in almost all countries worldwide,[1][2] under which banks that take deposits from the public are required to hold a proportion of their deposit liabilities in liquid assets as a reserve, and are at liberty to lend the remainder to borrowers.[3] Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the \"reserve requirement\" or \"reserve ratio\". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.","image":"Saenredam_-_Het_oude_stadhuis_te_Amsterdam.jpeg.webp","url":"Fractional-reserve_banking"}
