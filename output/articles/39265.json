{"title":"Samuel Slater","summary":"Samuel Slater (June 9, 1768 â€“ April 21, 1835) was an early English-American industrialist known as the \"Father of the American Industrial Revolution\" (a phrase coined by Andrew Jackson) and the \"Father of the American Factory System\". In the UK, he was called \"Slater the Traitor\"[1] and \"Sam the Slate\" because he brought British textile technology to the United States, modifying it for American use. He stole the textile factory machinery designs as an apprentice to a pioneer in the British industry before migrating to the United States at the age of 21. He designed the first textile mills in the US and later went into business for himself, developing a family business with his sons. He eventually owned thirteen spinning mills and had developed tenant farms and company towns around his textile mills, such as Slatersville, Rhode Island.","image":"Samuel_Slater_industrialist.jpg.webp","url":"Samuel_Slater"}
