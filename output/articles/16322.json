{"title":"Fishery","summary":"Fishery can mean either the enterprise of raising or harvesting fish and other aquatic life;[1] or more commonly, the site where such enterprise takes place (a.k.a. fishing ground).[2]  Commercial fisheries include wild fisheries and fish farms, both in freshwater bodies (about 10% of all catch) and the oceans (about 90%). About 500 million people worldwide are economically dependent on fisheries. 171 million tonnes of fish were produced in 2016, but overfishing is an increasing problem â€” causing declines in some populations.","image":"Becharof_Wilderness_Salmon.jpg.webp"}
