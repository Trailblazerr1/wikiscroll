{"title":"Donna Haraway","summary":"Donna J. Haraway (born September 6, 1944) is an American Professor Emerita in the History of Consciousness Department and Feminist Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, United States.[1] She is a prominent scholar in the field of science and technology studies, described in the early 1990s as a \"feminist and postmodernist\".[2] Haraway is the author of numerous foundational books and essays that bring together questions of science and feminism, such as \"A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century\" (1985) and \"Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective\" (1988).[3][4] Additionally, for her contributions to the intersection of information technology and feminist theory, Haraway is widely cited in works related to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Her Situated Knowledges and Cyborg Manifesto publications in particular, have sparked discussion withinÂ the HCI community regarding framing the positionality from which research and systems are designed. She is also a leading scholar in contemporary ecofeminism, associated with post-humanism and new materialism movements.[5][6] Her work criticizes anthropocentrism, emphasizes the self-organizing powers of nonhuman processes, and explores dissonant relations between those processes and cultural practices, rethinking sources of ethics.[7] Haraway criticizes the Anthropocene because it generalizes us as a species. However, she also recognizes the importance of it recognizing humans as key agents.[8] Haraway prefers the term Capitalocene which defines capitalism's relentless imperatives to expand itself and grow, but she does not like the theme of irreversible destruction in both the Anthropocene and Capitalocene.[9]","image":"Donna_Haraway_2006_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Donna_Haraway"}
