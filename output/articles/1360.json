{"title":"Montreal","summary":"Montreal (/ˌmʌntriˈɔːl/ (listen) MUN-tree-AWL; officially Montréal, French: [mɔ̃ʁeal] (listen)) is the second-most populous city in Canada and most populous city in the Canadian province of Quebec. Founded in 1642 as Ville-Marie, or \"City of Mary\",[16] it is named after Mount Royal,[17] the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is centred on the Island of Montreal, which obtained its name from the same origin as the city,[18][19] and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. The city is situated 196 km (122 mi) east of the national capital Ottawa, and 258 km (160 mi) southwest of the provincial capital, Quebec City.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
