{"title":"Amel-Marduk","summary":"Amel-Marduk (Babylonian cuneiform:   Amēl-Marduk,[1] meaning \"man of Marduk\"),[1] also known as Awil-Marduk,[2] or under the biblical rendition of his name, Evil-Merodach[1] (Hebrew: אֱוִיל מְרֹדַךְ‎, ʾÉwīl Mərōḏaḵ), was the third king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from 562 BC until his overthrow and murder in 560 BC. He was the successor of Nebuchadnezzar II (r. 605–562 BC). On account of the small number of surviving cuneiform sources, little is known of Amel-Marduk's reign and actions as king.","image":"Amel-Marduk_in_Akkadian.png.webp"}
