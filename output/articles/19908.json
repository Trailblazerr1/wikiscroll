{"title":"Hebrew alphabet","summary":"The Hebrew alphabet (Hebrew: אָלֶף־בֵּית עִבְרִי‎,[a] Alefbet ivri), known variously by scholars as the Ktav Ashuri, Jewish script, square script and block script, is an abjad script used in the writing of the Hebrew language and other Jewish languages, most notably Yiddish, Ladino, Judeo-Arabic, and Judeo-Persian. It is also used informally in Israel to write Levantine Arabic, especially among Druze.[2][3][4] It is an offshoot of the Imperial Aramaic alphabet, which flourished during the Achaemenid Empire and which itself derives from the Phoenician alphabet.","image":"Alefbet_ivri.svg.png.webp","url":"Hebrew_alphabet"}
