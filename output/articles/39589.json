{"title":"Scavenger","summary":"Scavengers are animals that consume dead organisms that have died from causes other than predation or have been killed by other predators.[1] While scavenging generally refers to carnivores feeding on carrion, it is also a herbivorous feeding behavior.[2] Scavengers play an important role in the ecosystem by consuming dead animal and plant material. Decomposers and detritivores complete this process, by consuming the remains left by scavengers.","image":"Sarcophaga_nodosa.jpg.webp","url":"Scavenger"}
