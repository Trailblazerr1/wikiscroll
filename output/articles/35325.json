{"title":"Poisson point process","summary":"In probability, statistics and related fields, a Poisson point process is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space.[1] The Poisson point process is often called simply the Poisson process, but it is also called a Poisson random measure, Poisson random point field or Poisson point field. This point process has convenient mathematical properties,[2] which has led to it being frequently defined in Euclidean space and used as a mathematical model for seemingly random processes in numerous disciplines such as astronomy,[3] biology,[4] ecology,[5] geology,[6] seismology,[7] physics,[8] economics,[9] image processing,[10] and telecommunications.[11][12]","image":"Poisson_process.svg.png.webp"}
