{"title":"5G","summary":"In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most current cellphones. 5G networks are predicted to have more than 1.7 billion subscribers worldwide by 2025, according to the GSM Association.[1] Like its predecessors, 5G networks are cellular networks, in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called cells.  All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the Internet and telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna in the cell.   The main advantage of the new networks is that they will have greater bandwidth, giving higher download speeds, eventually up to 10Â gigabits per second (Gbit/s).[2]   In addition to 5G being faster than existing networks, 5G can connect more different devices, and even if people are in crowded areas, the servers will be more unified, improving the quality of Internet services.[3] Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the networks will increasingly be used as general internet service providers (ISPs) for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet-of-things (IoT) and machine-to-machine areas. 4G cellphones are not able to use the new networks, which require 5G-enabled wireless devices.","image":"3GPP_5G_logo.png.webp","url":"5G"}
