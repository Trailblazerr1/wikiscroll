{"title":"Nondisjunction","summary":"Nondisjunction is the failure of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate properly during cell division. There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure of a pair of homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis I, failure of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis II, and failure of sister chromatids to separate during mitosis.[1][2][3] Nondisjunction results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).","image":"Nondisjunction_Diagrams.svg.png.webp"}
