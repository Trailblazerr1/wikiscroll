{"title":"Hybrid electric vehicle","summary":"A hybrid electric vehicle  (HEV) is a type of hybrid vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE)  system with an electric propulsion system (hybrid vehicle drivetrain). The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better performance. There is a variety of HEV types and the degree to which each function as an electric vehicle (EV) also varies. The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors), buses, boats and aircraft also exist.","image":"2018_Toyota_Prius_Excel_VVT-i_CVT_1.8.jpg.webp"}
