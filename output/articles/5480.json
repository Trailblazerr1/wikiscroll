{"title":"Bandura","summary":"A bandura (Ukrainian: банду́ра) is a Ukrainian, plucked string, folk instrument. It combines elements of the zither and lute and, up until the 1940s, was also often referred to by the term kobza. Early instruments (c. 1700) had 5 to 12 strings and similar to the lute. In the 20th century, the number of strings increased initially to 31 strings (1926), then to 56 strings - 68 strings on modern 'concert' instruments (1954).[2]","image":"Bandura.jpg.webp","url":"Bandura"}
