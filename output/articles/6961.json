{"title":"Bloodstream infections","summary":"Bloodstream infections (BSIs),  which include bacteremias when the infections are bacterial and fungemias when the infections are fungal, are infections present in the blood.[1] Blood is normally a sterile environment,[2] so the detection of microbes in the blood (most commonly accomplished by blood cultures[3]) is always abnormal. A bloodstream infection is different from sepsis, which is the host response to bacteria.[4]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Bloodstream_infections"}
