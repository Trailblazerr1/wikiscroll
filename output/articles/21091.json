{"title":"Hundred Years' War","summary":"The Hundred Years’ War (French: La guerre de Cent Ans; 1337–1453) was a series of armed conflicts between the kingdoms of England and France during the Late Middle Ages. It originated from disputed claims to the French throne between the English royal House of Plantagenet and the French royal House of Valois. Over time, the war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fueled by emerging nationalism on both sides.[1]","image":"Hundred_years_war_collage.jpg.webp","url":"Hundred_Years'_War"}
