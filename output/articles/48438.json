{"title":"Whooping cough","summary":"Whooping cough, also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious bacterial disease.[1][10] Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by weeks of severe coughing fits.[1] Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in.[1] The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \"100-day cough\".[3] A person may cough so hard that they vomit, break ribs, or become very tired from the effort.[1][2] Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe.[1] The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days.[11] Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder.[1]","image":"Pertussis.jpg.webp"}
