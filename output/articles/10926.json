{"title":"Conjugacy class","summary":"In mathematics, especially group theory, two elements a {\\displaystyle a} and b {\\displaystyle b} of a group are conjugate if there is an element g {\\displaystyle g} in the group such that b = g âˆ’ 1 a g . {\\displaystyle b=g^{-1}ag.} This is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are called conjugacy classes.","image":"ffd2487510aa438433a2579450ab2b3d557e5edc.svg","url":"Conjugacy_class"}
