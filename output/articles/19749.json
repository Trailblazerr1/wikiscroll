{"title":"Harvey Milk","summary":"Harvey Bernard Milk (May 22, 1930 â€“ November 27, 1978) was an American politician and the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Milk was born and raised in New York where he acknowledged his homosexuality as an adolescent, but chose to pursue sexual relationships with secrecy and discretion well into his adult years. His experience in the counterculture of the 1960s caused him to shed many of his conservative views about individual freedom and the expression of sexuality.","image":"Harvey_Milk_at_Gay_Pride_San_Jose%2C_June_1978_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Harvey_Milk"}
