{"title":"Anticoagulant","summary":"Anticoagulants, commonly known as blood thinners, are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood, prolonging the clotting time.[1] Some of them occur naturally in blood-eating animals such as leeches and mosquitoes, where they help keep the bite area unclotted long enough for the animal to obtain some blood.[2][3] As a class of medications, anticoagulants are used in therapy for thrombotic disorders.[4] Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are taken by many people in pill or tablet form, and various intravenous anticoagulant dosage forms are used in hospitals.[5][6] Some anticoagulants are used in medical equipment, such as sample tubes, blood transfusion bags, heart-lung machines, and dialysis equipment.[7][8] One of the first anticoagulants, warfarin, was initially approved as a rodenticide.[9]","image":"Coagulation_Cascade_and_Major_Classes_of_Anticoagulants.png.webp","url":"Anticoagulant"}
