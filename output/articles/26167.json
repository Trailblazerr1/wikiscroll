{"title":"Likelihood function","summary":"The likelihood function (often simply called the likelihood) describes the joint probability of the observed data as a function of the parameters of the chosen statistical model.[1] For each specific parameter value \n  \n    \n      \n        θ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\theta }\n  \n in the parameter space, the likelihood function \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        (\n        y\n        \n          |\n        \n        θ\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p(y|\\theta )}\n  \n therefore assigns a probabilistic prediction to the observed data \n  \n    \n      \n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y}\n  \n. Since it is essentially the product of sampling densities, the likelihood generally encapsulates both the data-generating process as well as the missing-data mechanism that produced the observed sample.","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg"}
