{"title":"Likelihood function","summary":"The likelihood function (often simply called the likelihood) describes the joint probability of the observed data as a function of the parameters of the chosen statistical model.[1] For each specific parameter value θ {\\displaystyle \\theta } in the parameter space, the likelihood function p ( y | θ ) {\\displaystyle p(y|\\theta )} therefore assigns a probabilistic prediction to the observed data y {\\displaystyle y} . Since it is essentially the product of sampling densities, the likelihood generally encapsulates both the data-generating process as well as the missing-data mechanism that produced the observed sample.","image":"6e5ab2664b422d53eb0c7df3b87e1360d75ad9af.svg","url":"Likelihood_function"}
