{"title":"Fraunhofer diffraction","summary":"In optics, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation is used to model the diffraction of waves when the diffraction pattern is viewed at a long distance from the diffracting object (in the far-field region), and also when it is viewed at the focal plane of an imaging lens.[1][2] In contrast, the diffraction pattern created near the object (in the near field region) is given by the Fresnel diffraction equation.","image":"103168b86f781fe6e9a4a87b8ea1cebe0ad4ede8.svg","url":"Fraunhofer_diffraction"}
