{"title":"Bremsstrahlung","summary":"Bremsstrahlung /ˈbrɛmʃtrɑːləŋ/[1] (German pronunciation: [ˈbʁɛms.ʃtʁaːlʊŋ] (listen)), from bremsen \"to brake\" and Strahlung \"radiation\"; i.e., \"braking radiation\" or \"deceleration radiation\", is electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus. The moving particle loses kinetic energy, which is converted into radiation (i.e., photons), thus satisfying the law of conservation of energy. The term is also used to refer to the process of producing the radiation. Bremsstrahlung has a continuous spectrum, which becomes more intense and whose peak intensity shifts toward higher frequencies as the change of the energy of the decelerated particles increases.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
