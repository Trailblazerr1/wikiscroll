{"title":"Crystal oscillator","summary":"A crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a constant frequency.[1][2][3]  This frequency is often used to keep track of time, as in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is a quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits incorporating them became known as crystal oscillators.[1] However, other piezoelectric materials including polycrystalline ceramics are used in similar circuits.","image":"16MHZ_Crystal.jpg.webp","url":"Crystal_oscillator"}
