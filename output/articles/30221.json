{"title":"Modern Standard Arabic","summary":"Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Modern Written Arabic (shortened to MWA),[3] terms used mostly by Western linguists,[4] is the variety of standardized, literary Arabic that developed in the Arab world in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; occasionally, it also refers to spoken Arabic that approximates this written standard. MSA is the language used in literature, academia, print and mass media, law and legislation, though it is generally not spoken as a first language, similar to Classical Latin.[4] It is a pluricentric standard language taught throughout the Arab world in formal education, differing significantly from many vernacular varieties of Arabic that are commonly spoken as mother tongues in the area; these are only partially mutually intelligible with both MSA and with each other depending on their proximity in the Arabic dialect continuum.","image":"Arabic_albayancalligraphy.svg.png.webp","url":"Modern_Standard_Arabic"}
