{"title":"1966 FIFA World Cup Final","summary":"The 1966 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match played at Wembley Stadium, London, on 30 July 1966 to determine the winner of the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the eighth FIFA World Cup.[1] The match was contested by England and West Germany, with England winning 4–2 after extra time to claim the Jules Rimet Trophy. It was the first – and to date only – occasion that England has hosted or won the World Cup. This remains England's only major tournament win and last final at a major international football tournament for 55 years, until 2021 when the nation reached the UEFA Euro 2020 Final at the new Wembley Stadium (which England lost to Italy after a penalty shootout).","image":"The_Queen_presents_the_1966_World_Cup_to_England_Captain%2C_Bobby_Moore._(7936243534).jpg.webp","url":"1966_FIFA_World_Cup_Final"}
