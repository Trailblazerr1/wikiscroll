{"title":"Saros (astronomy)","summary":"The saros (/ˈsɛərɒs/ (listen)) is a period of exactly 223 synodic months, approximately 6585.3211 days, or 18 years, 10, 11, or 12 days (depending on the number of leap years), and 8 hours, that can be used to predict eclipses of the Sun and Moon. One saros period after an eclipse, the Sun, Earth, and Moon return to approximately the same relative geometry, a near straight line, and a nearly identical eclipse will occur, in what is referred to as an eclipse cycle. A sar is one half of a saros.[1]","image":"Manual2021-X_MOUSSAS_SAROS.jpg.webp","url":"Saros_(astronomy)"}
