{"title":"Wax","summary":"Waxes are a diverse class of organic compounds that are lipophilic, malleable solids near ambient temperatures.  They include higher alkanes and lipids, typically with melting points above about 40 °C (104 °F), melting to give low viscosity liquids. Waxes are insoluble in water but soluble in organic, nonpolar solvents.  Natural waxes of different types are produced by plants and animals and occur in petroleum.","image":"Cetyl-palmitate.svg.png.webp","url":"Wax"}
