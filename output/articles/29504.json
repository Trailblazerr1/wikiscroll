{"title":"Metapopulation","summary":"A metapopulation consists of a group of spatially separated populations of the same species which interact at some level. The term metapopulation was coined by Richard Levins in 1969 to describe a model of population dynamics of insect pests in agricultural fields, but the idea has been most broadly applied to species in naturally or artificially fragmented habitats. In Levins' own words, it consists of \"a population of populations\".[1]","image":"Metapopulation_(1).svg.png.webp","url":"Metapopulation"}
