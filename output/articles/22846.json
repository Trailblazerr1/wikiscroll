{"title":"Jahanpanah","summary":"Jahanpanah was the fourth medieval city of Delhi established in 1326–1327 by Muhammad bin Tughlaq (1325–51), of the Delhi Sultanate.

Neither the city nor the fort has survived. Many reasons have been offered for such a situation. One of which is stated as the idiosyncratic rule of Mohammed bin Tughlaq when inexplicably he shifted the capital to Daulatabad in the Deccan and came back to Delhi soon after.[1][2][3]","image":"Octagonal_pavilion_and_hypostyle_hall.jpg.webp","url":"Jahanpanah"}
