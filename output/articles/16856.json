{"title":"Frank Lloyd Wright","summary":"Frank Lloyd Wright (June 8, 1867 â€“ April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator. He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called \"the best all-time work of American architecture\".[1] Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship.[2][3]","image":"Frank_Lloyd_Wright_portrait.jpg.webp"}
