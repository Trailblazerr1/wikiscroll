The Mosul metropolitan area has grown from the old city on the western side to encompass substantial areas on both the \"Left Bank\" (east side) and the \"Right Bank\" (west side), as locals call the two riverbanks. Mosul encloses the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nineveh on its east side.","image":"Tigris_river_Mosul.jpg.webp","url":"Mosul"}
