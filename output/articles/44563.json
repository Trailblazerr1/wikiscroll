{"title":"The Satanic Verses","summary":"The Satanic Verses is British writer Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, first published September 26, 1988 and inspired in part by the life of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. As with his previous books, Rushdie used magical realism and relied on contemporary events and people to create his characters. The title refers to the Satanic Verses, a group of Quranic verses that refer to three pagan Meccan goddesses: Allāt, Uzza, and Manāt.[1] The part of the story that deals with the \"satanic verses\" was based on accounts from the historians al-Waqidi and al-Tabari.[1]","image":"1988_Salman_Rushdie_The_Satanic_Verses.jpg.webp","url":"The_Satanic_Verses"}
