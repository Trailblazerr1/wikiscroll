{"title":"Three-cent silver","summary":"The three-cent silver, also known as the three-cent piece in silver or trime, was struck by the Mint of the United States for circulation from 1851 to 1872, and as a proof coin in 1873. Designed by the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, it circulated well while other silver coinage was being hoarded and melted, but once that problem was addressed, became less used.  It was abolished by Congress with the Coinage Act of 1873.","image":"1851-O_3CS_(obv).jpg.webp","url":"Three-cent_silver"}
