{"title":"Tornado Alley","summary":"Tornado Alley is a loosely defined area of the central United States where tornadoes are most frequent.[1] The term was first used in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska. Tornado climatologists distinguish peaks in activity in certain areas[2] and storm chasers have long recognized the Great Plains tornado belt.[3]","image":"Tornado_Alley_Diagram.svg.png.webp"}
