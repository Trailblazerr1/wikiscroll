{"title":"Germline","summary":"In biology and genetics, the germline is the population of a multicellular organism's cells that pass on their genetic material to the progeny (offspring). In other words, they are the cells that form the egg, sperm and the fertilised egg. They are usually differentiated to perform this function and segregated in a specific place away from other bodily cells.[1]","image":"Watsonia_meriana_detail_of_cormlets_on_inflorescence_IMG_6909.JPG.webp"}
