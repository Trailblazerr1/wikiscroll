{"title":"Pleiotropy","summary":"Pleiotropy (from Greek πλείων pleion, 'more', and τρόπος tropos, 'way') occurs when one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits. Such a gene that exhibits multiple phenotypic expression is called a pleiotropic gene. Mutation in a pleiotropic gene may have an effect on several traits simultaneously, due to the gene coding for a product used by a myriad of cells or different targets that have the same signaling function.","image":"SimpleGenotypePhenotypeMap.jpg.webp","url":"Pleiotropy"}
