The prison was used by the British government for the purpose of exiling political prisoners to the remote archipelago. Many notable activists, including Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, Batukeshwar Dutt, Hare Krishna Konar, Shiv Verma, Yogendra Shukla,  Satguru Ram Singh, and Sudhanshu Dasgupta were imprisoned here during the struggle for India's independence. Today, the complex serves as a national memorial monument.[2]","image":"Front_View_of_Cellular_Jail%2C_Port_Blair.JPG.webp","url":"Cellular_Jail"}
