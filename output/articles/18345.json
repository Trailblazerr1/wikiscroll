{"title":"Godfrey of Bouillon","summary":"Godfrey of Bouillon (French: Godefroy, Dutch: Godfried, German: Gottfried, Latin: Godefridus Bullionensis; 18 September 1060 â€“ 18 July 1100) was a French nobleman[1][2] and one of the pre-eminent leaders of the First Crusade. He was the first ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from 1099 to 1100. He avoided using the title of king, choosing instead that of princeps.[3] Older scholarship is more fond of another title, that of Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (Defender of the Holy Sepulchre),[4] a secondary title which is still preferred by the Catholic Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem.[5][6]","image":"Godfrey_of_Bouillon%2C_holding_a_pollaxe._(Manta_Castle%2C_Cuneo%2C_Italy).jpg.webp"}
