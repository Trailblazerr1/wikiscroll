{"title":"Secondary sex characteristic","summary":"Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during puberty in humans, and at sexual maturity in other animals.[1][2] These characteristics are particularly evident in the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish the sexes of a species,[3] but unlike the sex organs (primary sex characteristics), are not directly part of the reproductive system.[4] Secondary sex characteristics are believed to be the product of sexual selection for traits which display fitness, giving an organism an advantage over its rivals in courtship and in aggressive interactions.[5]","image":"Peacock.displaying.better.800pix.jpg.webp"}
