{"title":"Double Irish arrangement","summary":"The Double Irish was a base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) corporate tax tool used mostly by US multinationals since the late 1980s to avoid corporate taxation on non-U.S. profits.[lower-alpha 1] It was the largest tax avoidance tool in history and by 2010 was shielding US$100 billion annually in US multinational foreign profits from taxation,[lower-alpha 2] and was the main tool by which US multinationals built up untaxed offshore reserves of US$1 trillion from 2004 to 2018.[lower-alpha 3][lower-alpha 4]  Traditionally, it was also used with the Dutch Sandwich BEPS tool; however, changes to Irish tax law in 2010 dispensed with this requirement.","image":"Michael_Noonan_(official_portrait).jpg.webp"}
