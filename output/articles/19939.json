{"title":"Heimdall","summary":"In Norse mythology, Heimdall (from Old Norse Heimdallr, [ˈhɛimˌdɑlːz̠]) is a god who keeps watch for invaders and the onset of Ragnarök from his dwelling Himinbjörg, where the burning rainbow bridge Bifröst meets the sky. He is attested as possessing foreknowledge and keen senses, particularly eyesight and hearing.
