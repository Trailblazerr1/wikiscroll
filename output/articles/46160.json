{"title":"Turbocharger","summary":"A turbocharger (technically a turbosupercharger), colloquially known as turbo, is a turbine-driven, forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine's power output by forcing extra compressed air into the combustion chamber.[1][2] This improvement over a naturally aspirated engine's power output is because the compressor can force more air—and proportionately more fuel—into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure (and for that matter, ram air intakes) alone.","image":"Turbocharger.jpg.webp","url":"Turbocharger"}
