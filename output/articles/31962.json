{"title":"Newton-metre","summary":"The newton-metre (also newton metre or newton meter; symbol N⋅m[1] or N m[1]) is a unit of torque (also called moment) in the SI system. One newton-metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long.  The nonstandard notation Nm occurs in some fields.","image":"Newton-metre.png.webp","url":"Newton-metre"}
