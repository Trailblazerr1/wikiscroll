{"title":"Flour tortilla","summary":"A flour tortilla (/tɔːrˈtiːə/, /-jə/) or wheat tortilla is a type of soft, thin flatbread made from finely ground wheat flour.  It was originally inspired by the corn tortilla of Mexican cuisine, a flatbread of maize which predates the arrival of Europeans to the Americas. Made with a flour- and water-based dough, it is pressed and cooked, similar to corn tortillas.[1] The simplest recipes use only flour, water, fat, and salt, but commercially-made flour tortillas generally contain chemical leavening agents such as baking powder, and other ingredients.[2]","image":"NCI_flour_tortillas.jpg.webp","url":"Flour_tortilla"}
