{"title":"Vogue (Madonna song)","summary":"\"Vogue\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Madonna for her second soundtrack album, I'm Breathless (1990). It was released as the first single from the album on March 27, 1990, by Sire Records. Madonna was inspired by vogue dancers and choreographers Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza and Luis Xtravaganza from the Harlem \"House Ball\" community, the origin of the dance form, and they introduced \"vogueing\" to her at the Sound Factory club in New York City. \"Vogue\" is a house song which set trends in dance music in the 1990s with strong influences of 1970s disco within its composition. \"Vogue\" also contains a spoken section, in which Madonna name-checks various \"Golden Age\" Hollywood stars. Lyrically, the song is about enjoying oneself on the dance floor no matter who one is and it contains a theme of escapism. \"Vogue\" has appeared in a remixed form on two of Madonna's greatest hits compilations: The Immaculate Collection (1990) and Celebration (2009).","image":"Madonna%2C_Vogue_cover.png.webp"}
