{"title":"Frank Lucas","summary":"Frank Lucas (September 9, 1930 â€“ May 30, 2019) was an American drug trafficker who operated in Harlem, New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was known for cutting out middlemen in the drug trade and buying heroin directly from his source in the Golden Triangle in Southeast Asia. Lucas boasted that he smuggled heroin using the coffins of dead American servicemen,[6][7] as depicted in the feature film American Gangster (2007), which fictionalized aspects of his life. This claim is denied by his Southeast Asian associate Leslie \"Ike\" Atkinson.[8]","image":"FrankLucas.jpg.webp"}
