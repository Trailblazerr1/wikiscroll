{"title":"Isotope geochemistry","summary":"Isotope geochemistry is an aspect of geology based upon the study of natural variations in the relative abundances of isotopes of various elements. Variations in isotopic abundance are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and can reveal information about the ages and origins of rock, air or water bodies, or processes of mixing between them.","image":"644029acd392aed9a75b552fd44d893d6639ef51.svg"}
