{"title":"Lexus ES","summary":"The Lexus ES (Japanese: レクサス・ES, Rekusasu ES) is a series of mid-size executive cars sold by Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota since 1989. Seven generations of the sedan have been introduced to date, each offering V6 engines and the front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout. The first five generations of the ES were built on the Toyota Camry platform, with the sixth and seventh generations more closely related to the Avalon. Manual transmissions were offered until 1993, a lower-displacement inline-four engine became an option in Asian markets in 2010, and a gasoline-electric hybrid version was introduced in 2012. The ES was Lexus' only front-wheel drive vehicle until 1998, when the related RX was introduced, and the sedan occupied the entry-level luxury car segment of the Lexus lineup in North America and other regions until the debut of the IS in 1999. The ES name stands for \"Executive Sedan\".[3] However, some Lexus importers use the backronymic name, \"Elegant Sedan\".[4]","image":"Lexus_ES_350_(GSZ10)_IMG_4332.jpg.webp"}
