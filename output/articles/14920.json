{"title":"Environmental determinism","summary":"Environmental determinism (also known as climatic determinism or geographical determinism) is the study of how the physical environment predisposes societies and states towards particular development trajectories.[1] Jared Diamond, Jeffrey Herbst, Ian Morris, and other social scientists sparked a revival of the theory during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This \"neo-environmental determinism\" school of thought examines how geographic and ecological forces influence state-building, economic development, and institutions. Many scholars underscore that this approach was used to encourage colonialism and eurocentrism, and devalued human agency in non-Western societies, whereas modern figures like Diamond have instead used the approach as an explanation that rejects racism.[2][3]","image":"OrteliusWorldMap.jpeg.webp","url":"Environmental_determinism"}
