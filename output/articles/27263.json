{"title":"London Borough of Tower Hamlets","summary":"The London Borough of Tower Hamlets is a London borough covering much of the traditional East End. It was formed in 1965 from the merger of the former metropolitan boroughs of Stepney, Poplar, and Bethnal Green. The new authority's historical name refers to an alternative title for the Tower Division; the area of south-east Middlesex, focused on (but not limited to) the area of the modern borough, which owed military service to the Tower of London.","image":"Tower_Hamlets_arms.png.webp","url":"London_Borough_of_Tower_Hamlets"}
