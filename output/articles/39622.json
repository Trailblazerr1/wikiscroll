{"title":"School of Salamanca","summary":"The School of Salamanca (Spanish: Escuela de Salamanca) is the Renaissance of  thought in diverse intellectual areas by Spanish theologians, rooted in the intellectual and pedagogical work of Francisco de Vitoria. From the beginning of the 16th century the traditional Catholic conception of man and of his relation to God and to the world had been assaulted by the rise of humanism, by the Protestant Reformation and by the new geographical discoveries and their consequences. These new problems were addressed by the School of Salamanca. The name refers to the University of Salamanca, where de Vitoria and other members of the school were based.","image":"University_of_Salamanca.jpg.webp","url":"School_of_Salamanca"}
