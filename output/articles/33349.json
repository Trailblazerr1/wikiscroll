{"title":"Orthogonality","summary":"In mathematics, orthogonality is the generalization of the notion of perpendicularity to the linear algebra of bilinear forms.  Two elements u and v of a vector space with bilinear form B are orthogonal when B(u, v) = 0.  Depending on the bilinear form, the vector space may contain nonzero self-orthogonal vectors. In the case of function spaces, families of orthogonal functions are used to form a basis.","image":"Perpendicular-coloured.svg.png.webp","url":"Orthogonality"}
