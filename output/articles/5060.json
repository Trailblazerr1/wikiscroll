{"title":"Auxilia","summary":"The Auxilia (Latin: [au̯kˈs̠ɪlia], lit. \"auxiliaries\") were introduced as non-citizen troops attached to the citizen legions by Augustus after his reorganisation of the Imperial Roman army from 30 BC.[1] By the 2nd century, the Auxilia contained the same number of infantry as the legions and, in addition, provided almost all of the Roman army's cavalry (especially light cavalry and archers) and more specialised troops. The auxilia thus represented three-fifths of Rome's regular land forces at that time. Like their legionary counterparts, auxiliary recruits were mostly volunteers, not conscripts.","image":"Engineering_corps_traian_s_column_river_crossing.jpg.webp","url":"Auxilia"}
