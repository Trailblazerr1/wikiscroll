{"title":"Psychic","summary":"A psychic is a person who claims to use extrasensory perception (ESP) to identify information hidden from the normal senses, particularly involving telepathy or clairvoyance, or who performs acts that are apparently inexplicable by natural laws, such as psychokinesis or apportation. Although many people believe in psychic abilities, the scientific consensus is that there is no proof of the existence of such powers, and describes the practice as pseudoscience. The word \"psychic\" is also used as an adjective to describe such abilities.","image":"PsychicBoston.jpg.webp","url":"Psychic"}
