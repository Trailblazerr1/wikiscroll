{"title":"Amethyst","summary":"Amethyst is a violet variety of quartz. The name comes from the Koine Greek αμέθυστος amethystos from α- a-, \"not\" and μεθύσκω (Ancient Greek) methysko / μεθώ metho (Modern Greek), \"intoxicate\", a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness.[1] The ancient Greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication.","image":"Amethyst._Magaliesburg%2C_South_Africa.jpg.webp","url":"Amethyst"}
