{"title":"Sigma factor","summary":"A sigma factor (Ïƒ factor or specificity factor) is a protein needed for initiation of transcription in bacteria.[1][2] It is a bacterial transcription initiation factor that enables specific binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to gene promoters. It is homologous to archaeal transcription factor B and to eukaryotic factor TFIIB.[3] The specific sigma factor used to initiate transcription of a given gene will vary, depending on the gene and on the environmental signals needed to initiate transcription of that gene. Selection of promoters by RNA polymerase is dependent on the sigma factor that associates with it.[4] They are also found in plant chloroplasts as a part of the bacteria-like plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP).[5]","image":"Sigma_70_domains.png.webp","url":"Sigma_factor"}
