{"title":"Bundestag","summary":"The Bundestag (German pronunciation: [ˈbʊndəstaːk] (listen), \"Federal Diet\") is the German federal parliament. It is the only federal representative body that is directly elected by the German people. It is comparable to a lower house of legislatures, similar to the United States House of Representatives or the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The Bundestag was established by Title III[lower-alpha 2] of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Grundgesetz, pronounced [ˈɡʁʊntɡəˌzɛt͡s] (listen)) in 1949 as one of the legislative bodies of Germany and thus it is the historical successor to the earlier Reichstag.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
