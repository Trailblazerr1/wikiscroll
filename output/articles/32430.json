{"title":"Northern goshawk","summary":"The northern goshawk (/ˈɡɒsˌhɔːk/; Accipiter gentilis) is a medium-large raptor in the family Accipitridae, which also includes other extant diurnal raptors, such as eagles, buzzards and harriers. As a species in the genus Accipiter, the goshawk is often considered a \"true hawk\".[3] The scientific name is Latin; Accipiter is \"hawk\", from accipere, \"to grasp\", and gentilis is \"noble\" or \"gentle\" because in the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry.[4]","image":"Northern_Goshawk_ad_M2.jpg.webp"}
