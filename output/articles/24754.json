{"title":"Killing of Osama bin Laden","summary":"Osama bin Laden, the founder and first leader of the Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 2, 2011, shortly after 1:00 a.m. PKT[1][2] (20:00 UTC, May 1) by United States Navy SEALs of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six).[3] The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was carried out in a CIA-led operation with Joint Special Operations Command, commonly known as JSOC, coordinating the Special Mission Units involved in the raid. In addition to SEAL Team Six, participating units under JSOC included the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)—also known as \"Night Stalkers\"—and operators from the CIA's Special Activities Division, which recruits heavily from former JSOC Special Mission Units.[4][5] The operation ended a nearly 10-year search for bin Laden, following his role in the September 11 attacks on the United States.","image":"Osama_bin_Laden_compound1.jpg.webp","url":"Killing_of_Osama_bin_Laden"}
