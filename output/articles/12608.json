{"title":"Dengue virus","summary":"Dengue virus (DENV) is the cause of dengue fever. It is a mosquito-borne, single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus.[1][2]  Four serotypes of the virus have been found, a reported fifth has yet to be confirmed,[3][4][5] all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease.[1] Nevertheless, scientists' understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic as, rather than distinct antigenic groups, a continuum appears to exist.[6]  This same study identified 47 strains of dengue virus.[7]  Additionally, coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for zika virus and chikungunya complicate matters in real-world infections.[8]","image":"Dengue.jpg.webp","url":"Dengue_virus"}
