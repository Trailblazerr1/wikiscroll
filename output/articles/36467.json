{"title":"Public school (United Kingdom)","summary":"A public school in England and Wales (but not Scotland) is a fee-charging endowed school originally for older boys that was \"public\" in the sense of being open to pupils irrespective of locality, denomination or paternal trade or profession. Although the term \"public school\" has been in use since at least the 18th century,[1] its usage was formalised by the Public Schools Act 1868,[2][3] which put into law most recommendations of the 1864 Clarendon Report. Nine prestigious schools were investigated by Clarendon, and seven subsequently reformed by the Act: Eton, Shrewsbury, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, and Charterhouse.[4]","image":"Rugby_School_850.jpg.webp","url":"Public_school_(United_Kingdom)"}
