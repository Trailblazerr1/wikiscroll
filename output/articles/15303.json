{"title":"Euphonium","summary":"The euphonium is a medium-sized, 3 or 4-valve, often compensating, conical-bore, tenor-voiced brass instrument that derives its name from the Ancient Greek word εὔφωνος euphōnos,[1] meaning \"well-sounding\" or \"sweet-voiced\" (εὖ eu means \"well\" or \"good\" and φωνή phōnē means \"sound\", hence \"of good sound\"). The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have piston valves, though some models with rotary valves do exist.","image":"Euphonium_Boosey_and_hawkes.jpg.webp"}
