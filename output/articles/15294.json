{"title":"Euler's totient function","summary":"In number theory, Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n. It is written using the Greek letter phi as \n  \n    \n      \n        φ\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varphi (n)}\n  \n or \n  \n    \n      \n        ϕ\n        (\n        n\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi (n)}\n  \n, and may also be called Euler's phi function. In other words, it is the number of integers k in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n, k) is equal to 1.[2][3] The integers k of this form are sometimes referred to as totatives of n.","image":"f067864064667dd5f8b2508b9cbf983d89788629.svg"}
