{"title":"Portal hypertension","summary":"Portal hypertension is abnormally increased portal venous pressure â€“ blood pressure in the portal vein and its branches, that drain from most of the intestine to the liver.[3] Portal hypertension is defined as a hepatic venous pressure gradient greater than 5 mmHg.[4][5] Cirrhosis (a form of chronic liver failure) is the most common cause of portal hypertension; other, less frequent causes are therefore grouped as non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. When it becomes severe enough to cause symptoms or complications, treatment may be given to decrease portal hypertension itself or to manage its complications.","image":"Gray591.png.webp","url":"Portal_hypertension"}
