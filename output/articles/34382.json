{"title":"Pentagon UFO videos","summary":"The Pentagon UFO videos are selected visual recordings of cockpit instrumentation displays from United States Navy fighter jets based aboard aircraft carriers USS Nimitz and USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2004, 2014 and 2015, with additional footage taken by other Navy personnel in 2019. The four grainy, monochromic videos, widely characterized as officially documenting UFOs, were the subject of extensive coverage in the media since 2017. The Pentagon later addressed and officially released the first three videos in 2020,[1] and confirmed the provenance of the leaked 2019 videos in two statements made in 2021.[2]","image":"USS_Russell_UFO_-_July_2019.png.webp"}
