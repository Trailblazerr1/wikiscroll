{"title":"Atmosphere of Earth","summary":"The atmosphere of Earth, commonly known as air, is the layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).","image":"Thin_Line_of_Earth's_Atmosphere_and_the_Setting_Sun.jpg.webp","url":"Atmosphere_of_Earth"}
