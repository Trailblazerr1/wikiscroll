{"title":"Guillotine","summary":"A guillotine (/ˈɡɪlətiːn/ GHIL-ə-teen, also US: /ˈɡiːətiːn/ GHEE-, French: [ɡijɔtin] (listen)) is an apparatus designed for efficiently carrying out executions by beheading. The device consists of a tall, upright frame with a weighted and angled blade suspended at the top. The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame, positioning the neck directly below the blade. The blade is then released, swiftly and forcefully decapitating the victim with a single, clean pass so that the head falls into a basket or other receptacle below.","image":"Guillotine_Luxembourg_01.jpg.webp","url":"Guillotine"}
