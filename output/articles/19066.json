{"title":"Groupthink","summary":"Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs.[1] This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation.[2][3]","image":"WilliamHWhyteJrGroupthinkFortuneMarch1952Page114.png.webp","url":"Groupthink"}
