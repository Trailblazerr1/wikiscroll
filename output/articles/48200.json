{"title":"Wendell Willkie","summary":"Wendell Lewis Willkie (born Lewis Wendell Willkie; February 18, 1892 â€“ October 8, 1944) was an American lawyer, corporate executive, and the 1940 Republican nominee for President. Willkie appealed to many convention delegates as the Republican field's only interventionist: although the U.S. remained neutral prior to Pearl Harbor, he favored greater U.S. involvement in World War II to support Britain and other Allies. His Democratic opponent, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, won the 1940 election with about 55% of the popular vote and took the electoral college vote by a wide margin.","image":"Wendell_Willkie_cph.3a38684.jpg.webp"}
