{"title":"Safety data sheet","summary":"A safety data sheet (SDS),[1] material safety data sheet (MSDS),  or product safety data sheet (PSDS) is a document that lists information relating to occupational safety and health for the use of various substances and products. SDSs are a widely used system for cataloguing information on chemicals, chemical compounds, and chemical mixtures. SDS information may include instructions for the safe use and potential hazards associated with a particular material or product, along with spill-handling procedures. The older MSDS formats could vary from source to source within a country depending on national requirements; however, the newer SDS format is internationally standardized.","image":"page1-170px-Cr-Ac-OH-MSDS_SigmaAldrich.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Safety_data_sheet"}
