{"title":"Road to Ruin (Ramones album)","summary":"Road to Ruin is the fourth studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, released on September 21, 1978, through Sire Records as LP record, 8 track cartridge & audio cassette.[1] It was the first Ramones album to feature new drummer Marky Ramone, who replaced Tommy Ramone. Tommy left the band due to low sales of previous albums as well as stress he experienced while touring; however, he stayed with the band to produce the album with Ed Stasium. The artwork's concept was designed by Ramones fan Gus MacDonald and later modified by John Holmstrom to include Marky instead of Tommy. The album includes the well-known track \"I Wanna Be Sedated\".","image":"Ramones_-_Road_to_Ruin_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Road_to_Ruin_(Ramones_album)"}
