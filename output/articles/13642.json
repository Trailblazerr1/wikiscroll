{"title":"Drinking water","summary":"Drinking water, also known as potable water, is water that is safe to drink or use for food preparation. The amount of drinking water required to maintain good health varies, and depends on physical activity level, age, health-related issues, and environmental conditions.[1][2] For those who work in a hot climate, up to 16 litres (4.2 US gal) a day may be required.[1] On average, American households use 300 gallons of water a day.[3]\nTypically in developed countries, tap water meets drinking water quality standards, even though only a small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation. All public water suppliers in the US must uphold a certain standard of water quality. If the requirements are met, Americans can drink their local tap water.[4] Other typical uses for tap water include washing, toilets, and irrigation. Greywater may also be used for toilets or irrigation. Its use for irrigation however may be associated with risks.[5] Water may also be unacceptable due to levels of toxins or suspended solids.","image":"Drinking_water.jpg.webp"}
