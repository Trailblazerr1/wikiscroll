{"title":"Conservative Party (UK)","summary":"The Conservative Party, officially the Conservative and Unionist Party, and also known colloquially as the Tories, Tory Party, or simply the Conservatives, is a political party in the United Kingdom. Ideologically, the Conservatives sit on the centre-right of the political spectrum. The Conservatives formed a fixed term coalition government with the Liberal Democrats[17][18] from 2010â€“2015. Following the 2015 election, the Conservatives formed a Government with a 12-seat majority.[19] A snap general election in 2017 meant they held power without an overall majority[20][21] until 2019, when they regained an overall majority in the House of Commons, with 365 Members of Parliament. The party also has 258 appointed[22] members of the House of Lords, 9 members of the London Assembly, 31 members of the Scottish Parliament, 16 members of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament) and 7,445 local authority councillors.[16]","image":"Conservatives_logo.svg.png.webp"}
