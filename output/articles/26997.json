{"title":"List of songs recorded by Ariana Grande","summary":"American singer Ariana Grande's music career began in 2008 when she contributed vocals to the cast recording of the musical 13. She then went to contribute to the soundtrack albums of the Nickelodeon TV sitcom Victorious, in which she also starred from 2010 to 2013.[1] Three soundtrack albums were released between 2011 and 2012.[2][3][4] In 2011 Grande also began to work as an independent artist outside of the show. She then released \"Put Your Hearts Up\", a bubblegum pop song, during the same year. Grande later called it \"inauthentic and fake\" and described it as \"the worst moment of my life\"; she went as far as hiding the song's music video on her Vevo account.[5] After expressing disappointment with the song, Republic Records gave Grande more creative control over the production of her debut album.[5]","image":"Ariana_Grande_(33228771606)_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
