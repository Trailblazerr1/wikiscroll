{"title":"Basic Law of Saudi Arabia","summary":"The Basic Law of Saudi Arabia (alternative name: Basic System of Governance; Arabic: النظام الأساسي للحكم‎, Al Nidham Al Asasi lil Hukm) is a constitution-like charter divided into nine chapters, consisting of 83 articles.[1] \nThe Basic Law (in Article One) states that the constitution of Saudi Arabia is \"the Holy Qur'an, and the Sunna (Traditions)\" of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. However, the Basic Law contains many characteristics of what might be called a constitution in other countries (\"The Law of Governance\", \"Rights and Duties\").  The Basic Law is in accordance with a Wahhabi and Salafi understanding of Sharia and does not override Islamic laws.","image":"Emblem_of_Saudi_Arabia_(2).svg.png.webp"}
