{"title":"George Tucker (politician)","summary":"George Tucker (August 20, 1775 – April 10, 1861) was born in Bermuda, and became an American attorney, politician, historian, author, and educator in Virginia. His literary works include The Valley of Shenandoah (1824), the first fiction of colonial life in Virginia, and Voyage to the Moon (1827), which is among the nation's earliest science fiction novels. Tucker also published the first comprehensive biography of Thomas Jefferson in 1837, as well as his History of the United States (1856). Tucker's authorship, and his work as a teacher, served to redeem an earlier life of unprincipled habits which had brought him some disrepute.","image":"Prof._George_Tucker.jpg.webp","url":"George_Tucker_(politician)"}
