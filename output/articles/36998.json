{"title":"Rail transport","summary":"Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, which are located on tracks. In contrast to road transport, where the vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on sleepers (ties) set in ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also possible, such as \"slab track\", in which the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.","image":"World_railway_network.png.webp","url":"Rail_transport"}
