{"title":"Audio bit depth","summary":"In digital audio using pulse-code modulation (PCM), bit depth is the number of bits of information in each sample, and it directly corresponds to the resolution of each sample. Examples of bit depth include Compact Disc Digital Audio, which uses 16 bits per sample, and DVD-Audio and Blu-ray Disc which can support up to 24 bits per sample.","image":"4-bit-linear-PCM.svg.png.webp","url":"Audio_bit_depth"}
