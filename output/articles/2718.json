{"title":"Alcoholism","summary":"Alcoholism is, broadly, any drinking of alcohol that results in significant mental or physical health problems.[14] Because there is disagreement on the definition of the word \"alcoholism\", it is not a recognized diagnostic entity. Predominant diagnostic classifications are alcohol use disorder[2] (DSM-5)[4] or alcohol dependence (ICD-11); these are defined in their respective sources.[15]","image":"A_wife_asking_her_drunkard_husband_to_hand_over_a_bottle_Wellcome_L0067935.jpg.webp"}
