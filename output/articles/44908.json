{"title":"Thin Man (nuclear bomb)","summary":"\"Thin Man\" was the code name for a proposed plutonium gun-type nuclear bomb that the United States was developing during the Manhattan Project. Its development was abandoned when it was discovered that the spontaneous fission rate of nuclear reactor-bred plutonium was too high for use in a gun-type design due to the high concentration of the isotope plutonium-240.","image":"Thin_man_bomb_casings.jpg.webp","url":"Thin_Man_(nuclear_bomb)"}
