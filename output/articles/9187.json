{"title":"Chaitanya Mahaprabhu","summary":"Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (Bengali: চৈতন্য মহাপ্রভু pronounced [ˈt͡ʃɔiˌt̪ɔnːo mɔɦaˑprob̤u]; IAST: Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Sanskrit pronunciation: [t͡ɕɐit̪ɐnjɐ mɐɦaːprɐb̤u]), born as Vishvambhar Mishra (Bengali: বিশ্বম্ভর মিশ্র),[1] was a 15th century Indian saint considered to be the combined avatar of Radha and Krishna by his disciples. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's mode of worshipping Krishna with ecstatic song and dance had a profound effect on Vaishnavism in Bengal. He was also the chief proponent of the Vedantic philosophy of Achintya Bheda Abheda Tattva. Mahaprabhu founded Gaudiya Vaishnavism (a.k.a. Brahma-Madhva-Gaudiya Sampradaya). He expounded Bhakti yoga and popularized the chanting of the Hare Krishna Maha-mantra.[2] He composed the Shikshashtakam (eight devotional prayers).[3][4]","image":"Chaitanya-Mahabrabhu-at-Jagannath.jpg.webp","url":"Chaitanya_Mahaprabhu"}
