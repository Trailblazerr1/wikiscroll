{"title":"Thing (assembly)","summary":"A thing[lower-alpha 1] (that is, \"assembly\" or folkmoot) was a governing assembly in early Germanic society, made up of the free people of the community presided over by a lawspeaker. Things took place at regular intervals, usually at prominent places that were accessible by travel. They provided legislative functions, as well as being social events and opportunities for trade. In modern usage, the meaning of this word in English and other languages has shifted to mean not just an assemblage of some sort but simply any sort of thing.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Thing_(assembly)"}
