{"title":"Paramecium","summary":"Paramecium (also Paramoecium, /ˌpærəˈmiːʃ(i)əm/, PARR-ə-MEE-sh(ee-)əm, /-siəm/, -⁠see-əm)[1] is a genus of eukaryotic, unicellular ciliates, commonly studied as a representative of the ciliate group. Paramecia are widespread in freshwater, brackish, and marine environments and are often very abundant in stagnant basins and ponds. Because some species are readily cultivated and easily induced to conjugate and divide, it has been widely used in classrooms and laboratories to study biological processes. Its usefulness as a model organism has caused one ciliate researcher to characterize it as the \"white rat\" of the phylum Ciliophora.[2]","image":"Paramecium.jpg.webp"}
