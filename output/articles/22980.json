{"title":"James the Less","summary":"James the Less (Greek: Ἰάκωβος ὁ μικρός Iakōbos ho mikros) is a figure of early Christianity, one of the Twelve chosen by Jesus. He is also called \"the Minor\", \"the Little\", \"the Lesser\", or \"the Younger\", according to translation. He is not to be confused with James, son of Zebedee (\"James the Great or Elder\"). He is identified by some as James, son of Alphaeus and as James, brother of Jesus, thought of by Jerome and those who followed him as really the cousin of Jesus. James the Less was traditionally commemorated with St. Philip either on May 1 or May 3 in the Western Christian calendars.","image":"Jacobus_Minor_San_Giovanni_in_Laterano_2006-09-07.jpg.webp","url":"James_the_Less"}
