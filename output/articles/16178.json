{"title":"Final Solution","summary":"The Final Solution (German: Endlösung, pronounced [ˈɛntˌløːzʊŋ] (listen)) or the Final Solution to the Jewish Question (German: Endlösung der Judenfrage, pronounced [ˈɛntˌløːzʊŋ deːɐ̯ ˈjuːdn̩ˌfʁaːɡə] (listen)) was a Nazi plan for the genocide of Jews during World War II. The \"Final Solution to the Jewish question\" was the official code name for the murder of all Jews within reach, which was not restricted to the European continent.[1] This policy of deliberate and systematic genocide starting across German-occupied Europe was formulated in procedural and geopolitical terms by Nazi leadership in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference held near Berlin,[2] and culminated in the Holocaust, which saw the killing of 90% of Polish Jews,[3] and two-thirds of the Jewish population of Europe.[4]","image":"Heydrich-Endlosung.jpg.webp","url":"Final_Solution"}
