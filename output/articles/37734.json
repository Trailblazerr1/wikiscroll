{"title":"Resurrectionists in the United Kingdom","summary":"Resurrectionists were body snatchers who were commonly employed by anatomists in the United Kingdom during the 18th and 19th centuries to exhume the bodies of the recently dead.  Between 1506 and 1752 only a very few cadavers were available each year for anatomical research.  The supply was increased when, in an attempt to intensify the deterrent effect of the death penalty, Parliament passed the Murder Act 1752.  By allowing judges to substitute the public display of executed criminals with dissection (a fate generally viewed with horror), the new law significantly increased the number of bodies anatomists could legally access.  This proved insufficient to meet the needs of the hospitals and teaching centres that opened during the 18th century.  Corpses and their component parts became a commodity, but although the practice of disinterment was hated by the general public, bodies were not legally anyone's property.  The resurrectionists therefore operated in a legal grey area.","image":"Resurrectionists_by_phiz.png.webp"}
