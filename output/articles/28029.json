{"title":"Magpie","summary":"Magpies are birds of the Corvidae family. Like other members of their family, they are widely considered to be intelligent creatures. The Eurasian magpie, for instance, is thought to rank among the world's smartest creatures,[1][2] and is one of the few non-mammal species able to recognize itself in a mirror test.[3] They are particularly well known for their songs and were once popular as cagebirds. In addition to other members of the genus Pica, corvids considered as magpies are in the genera Cissa, Urocissa, and Cyanopica.","image":"Birds_of_Sweden_2016_35.jpg.webp","url":"Magpie"}
