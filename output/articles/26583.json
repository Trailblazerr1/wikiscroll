{"title":"List of Olympic medalists in short track speed skating","summary":"Short track speed skating is a sport that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. The first Winter Olympics, held in 1924, included speed skating, but the first official short track speed skating events were not held until the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.[1] Before 1992, short track speed skating events were held at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport. At those games, events for both men and women were held in five disciplines: 500 metre, 1000 metre, 1500 metre, 3000 metre and the relay (3000 metres for women, 5000 metres for men). The Netherlands, United Kingdom and South Korea won two gold medals each, with Canada, Italy, Japan and China picking up a gold medal each. The results of those demonstration events are not considered official and are not included in this list.[2] At the 1992 Winter Olympics, there were four medal events: men's 1000 metres, men's 5000 metre relay, women's 500 metres and women's 3000 metre relay. Men's 500 metres and women's 1000 metres was added in 1994. The men's and women's 1500 metres were added in 2002[3] and all eight events have been held at every Olympic Games since.[2]","image":"Flag_of_South_Korea_(1984â€“1997).svg.png.webp"}
