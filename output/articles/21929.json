{"title":"IndyCar Series","summary":"The IndyCar Series, currently known as the NTT IndyCar Series under sponsorship, is the premier level of open-wheel racing in the United States.[2] Its parent company began in 1996 as the Indy Racing League (IRL), which was created by then Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George as a competitor to CART. CART operated under the \"IndyCar\" name from 1992 until 1996, when they agreed to change their name to Champ Car after a series of lawsuits, with the proviso that the IRL would not use \"IndyCar\" until after the 2002 season. In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with CART's successor, the Champ Car World Series. The series is self-sanctioned by its parent company, INDYCAR, LLC.","image":"IndyCar_Series_logo.svg.png.webp"}
