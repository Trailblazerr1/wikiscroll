{"title":"Cuneiform","summary":"Cuneiform[note 1] is a logo-syllabic script that was used to write at least fifteen languages of the Ancient Near East.[4][5] The script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era.[6] It is named for the characteristic wedge-shaped impressions (Latin: cuneus) which form its signs. Cuneiform was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Along with Egyptian hieroglyphs, it is one of the earliest writing systems.","image":"Xerxes_Cuneiform_Van.JPG.webp","url":"Cuneiform"}
