{"title":"Wreck of the Titanic","summary":"The wreck of the RMS Titanic lies at a depth of about 12,500 feet (3,800 metres; 2,100 fathoms), about 370 nautical miles (690 kilometres) south-southeast of the coast of Newfoundland. It lies in two main pieces about 2,000 feet (600Â m) apart. The bow is still recognisable with many preserved interiors, despite deterioration and damage sustained hitting the sea floor. In contrast, the stern is completely ruined. A debris field around the wreck contains hundreds of thousands of items spilled from the ship as she sank. The bodies of the passengers and crew would have also been distributed across the sea bed, but have been consumed by other organisms.","image":"Titanic_wreck_bow.jpg.webp"}
