{"title":"Hull House","summary":"Hull House was a settlement house in Chicago, Illinois, United States that was co-founded in 1889 by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr. Located on the Near West Side of the city, Hull House (named after the original house's first owner Charles Jerald Hull) opened to serve recently arrived European immigrants. By 1911, Hull House had expanded to 13 buildings.  In 1912 the Hull House complex was completed with the addition of a summer camp, the Bowen Country Club.[3][4][5]  With its innovative social, educational, and artistic programs, Hull House became the standard bearer for the movement that had grown nationally, by 1920, to almost 500 settlement houses.[6]","image":"lossy-page1-250px-The_Hull_House%2C_Chicago_(front).tif.jpg.webp","url":"Hull_House"}
