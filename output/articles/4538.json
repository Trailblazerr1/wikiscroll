{"title":"Artificial intelligence","summary":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of \"intelligent agents\": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[lower-alpha 1] Some popular accounts use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\", however, this definition is rejected by major AI researchers.[lower-alpha 2]","image":"Anatomy-1751201_1280.png.webp","url":"Artificial_intelligence"}
