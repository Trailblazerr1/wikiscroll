{"title":"List of The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episodes","summary":"Treehouse of Horror, also known as The Simpsons Halloween Specials, is a series of Halloween-themed episodes of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, each consisting of three separate, self-contained segments. These segments usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and always take place outside the normal continuity of the show and are therefore considered to be non-canon.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_The_Simpsons_Treehouse_of_Horror_episodes"}
