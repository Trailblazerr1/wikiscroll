{"title":"Justified (album)","summary":"Justified is the debut solo studio album by American singer Justin Timberlake. It was released on November 5, 2002, by Jive Records. The album was written and recorded in a six-week period as Timberlake's band NSYNC was on hiatus. Half of the tracks were originally written for Michael Jackson by the Neptunes and later modified. For his solo album, Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an R&B artist opposed to the previous pop music recorded by the group. The majority of the album was produced by the Neptunes (credited as \"Williams and Hugo\") and Timbaland, and features guest appearances by Janet Jackson, Clipse, and Bubba Sparxxx.\nPrimarily an R&B album, Justified also contains influences of dance-pop, funk, and soul music.","image":"Justified_-_Justin_Timberlake.png.webp"}
