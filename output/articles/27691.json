{"title":"Lymph","summary":"Lymph (from Latin, lympha meaning \"water\"[1]) is the fluid that flows through the lymphatic system, a system composed of lymph vessels (channels) and intervening lymph nodes whose function, like the venous system, is to return fluid from the tissues to the central circulation.  Interstitial fluid – the fluid between the cells in all body tissues[2] –  enters the lymph capillaries. This lymphatic fluid is then transported via progressively larger lymphatic vessels through lymph nodes, where substances are removed by tissue lymphocytes and circulating lymphocytes are added to the fluid, before emptying ultimately into the right or the left subclavian vein, where it mixes with central venous blood.","image":"Illu_lymph_capillary.png.webp"}
