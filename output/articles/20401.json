{"title":"Historical Vedic religion","summary":"The historical Vedic religion (also known as Vedicism, Vedism or  ancient Hinduism[lower-alpha 1]), and subsequently Brahmanism (also spelled as Brahminism), constituted the religious ideas and practices among some of the Indo-Aryan peoples of northwest India (Punjab and the western Ganges plain) of ancient India during the Vedic period (1500â€“500 BC).[3][4][5][6] These ideas and practices are found in the Vedic texts, and some Vedic rituals are still practiced today.[7][8][9] It is one of the major traditions which shaped Hinduism, though present-day Hinduism is markedly different from the historical Vedic religion.[5][10][note 1]","image":"Late_Vedic_Culture_(1100-500_BCE).png.webp","url":"Historical_Vedic_religion"}
