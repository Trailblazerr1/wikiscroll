{"title":"Linkage disequilibrium","summary":"In population genetics, linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association of alleles at different loci in a given population. Loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when the frequency of association of their different alleles is higher or lower than what would be expected if the loci were independent and associated randomly.[1]","image":"86bb5c73d9c768935ec9e9683e4972cf02121588.svg"}
