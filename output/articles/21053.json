{"title":"Human skin color","summary":"Human skin color ranges from the darkest brown to the lightest hues. Differences in skin color among individuals is caused by variation in pigmentation, which is the result of genetics (inherited from one's biological parents), the exposure to the sun, or both. Differences across populations evolved through natural selection, because of differences in environment, and regulate the biochemical effects  of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin.[1]","image":"Coloured-family.jpg.webp"}
