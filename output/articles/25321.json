{"title":"Lady A","summary":"Lady A  (formerly known as Lady Antebellum[1]) is an American country music group formed in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2006. The group is composed of Hillary Scott (lead and background vocals), Charles Kelley (lead and background vocals, guitar), and Dave Haywood (background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin). Scott is the daughter of country music singer Linda Davis, and Kelley is the brother of pop singer Josh Kelley. The band abbreviated the name to \"Lady A\" in June 2020 amid the George Floyd protests in an attempt to blunt the name's associations with slavery and the Antebellum South, causing a dispute with Black blues and gospel singer Anita White, who had been using the name Lady A for more than 20 years.","image":"Lady_A_-_Charlotte_12-27-12-39.jpg.webp"}
