{"title":"Balkan Mountains","summary":"The Balkan mountain range (Ancient Greek: Αίμος, Latin: Haemus, known locally also as Stara planina[1]) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe. The range is conventionally taken to begin at the peak of Vrashka Chuka on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia. It then runs for about 560 kilometres (350 mi), first in a south-easterly direction along the border, then eastward across Bulgaria, forming a natural barrier between the northern and southern halves of the country, before finally reaching the Black Sea at Cape Emine. The mountains reach their highest point with Botev Peak at 2,376 metres (7,795 ft).","image":"Kom_stara_planina_pano.jpg.webp"}
