{"title":"Energy transition","summary":"Energy transition is a significant structural change in an energy system.[2] Historically, there is a correlation between an increasing demand for energy and availability of different energy sources.[3] The current transition to renewable energy, and perhaps other types of sustainable energy, differs as it is largely driven by a recognition that global carbon emissions must be brought to zero, and since fossil fuels are the largest single source of carbon emissions, the quantity of fossil fuels that can be produced is limited by the COP21 Paris Agreement of 2015 to keep global warming below 1.5 °C. In recent years, the term energy transition has been coined in the framework of a move towards sustainability through increased integration of renewable energy in the realm of daily life.","image":"Global_Energy_Consumption.svg.png.webp","url":"Energy_transition"}
