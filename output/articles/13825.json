{"title":"Dwarf (folklore)","summary":"In Germanic folklore, including Germanic mythology, a dwarf is an entity that dwells in mountains and in the earth. The entity is variously associated with wisdom, smithing, mining, and crafting. Dwarfs are sometimes described as short and ugly, although some scholars have questioned whether this is a later development stemming from comical portrayals of the beings.[1] Dwarfs continue to be depicted in modern popular culture in a variety of media.","image":"Two_Völuspá_Dwarves_by_Frølich.jpg.webp","url":"Dwarf_(folklore)"}
