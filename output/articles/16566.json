{"title":"Focal seizure","summary":"Focal seizures (also called partial seizures[1] and localized seizures) are seizures which affect initially only one hemisphere of the brain.[2][3] The brain is divided into two hemispheres, each consisting of four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. A focal seizure is generated in and affects just one part of the brain – a whole hemisphere or part of a lobe. Symptoms will vary according to where the seizure occurs. When seizures occur in the frontal lobe the patient may experience a wave-like sensation in the head. When seizures occur in the temporal lobe, a feeling of déjà vu may be experienced. When seizures are localized to the parietal lobe, a numbness or tingling may occur. With seizures occurring in the occipital lobe, visual disturbances or hallucinations have been reported.[4]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Focal_seizure"}
