{"title":"Neuropsychiatry","summary":"Neuropsychiatry or Organic Psychiatry is a branch of medicine that deals with psychiatry as it relates to neurology, in an effort to understand and attribute behavior to the interaction of neurobiology and social psychology factors.[1] Within neuropsychiatry, the mind is considered \"as an emergent property of the brain\",[2] whereas other behavioral and neurological specialties might consider the two as separate entities. Neuropsychiatry preceded the current disciplines of psychiatry and neurology, which previously had common training,[3] however, those disciplines have subsequently diverged and are typically practiced separately.","image":"Gray739.png.webp"}
