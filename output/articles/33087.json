{"title":"Open set","summary":"In mathematics, open sets are a generalization of  open intervals in the real line. In a metric space—that is, when a distance function is defined—open sets are the sets that, with every point P, contain all points that are sufficiently near to P (that is, all points whose distance to P is less than some value depending on P).","image":"Red_blue_circle.svg.png.webp","url":"Open_set"}
