{"title":"Lattice (group)","summary":"In geometry and group theory, a lattice in R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} is a subgroup of the additive group R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} which is isomorphic to the additive group Z n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {Z} ^{n}} , and which spans the real vector space R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} . In other words, for any basis of R n {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}} , the subgroup of all linear combinations with integer coefficients of the basis vectors forms a lattice. A lattice may be viewed as a regular tiling of a space by a primitive cell.","image":"c510b63578322050121fe966f2e5770bea43308d.svg","url":"Lattice_(group)"}
