{"title":"Charles Edward Stuart","summary":"Charles Edward Louis John Casimir Sylvester Severino Maria Stuart (20 December 1720  â€“ 30 January 1788) was the elder son of James Francis Edward Stuart, grandson of James II and VII, and the Stuart claimant to the throne of Great Britain after 1766 as \"Charles III\". During his lifetime, he was also known as \"the Young Pretender\" and \"the Young Chevalier\"; in popular memory, he is \"Bonnie Prince Charlie\". He is best remembered for his role in the 1745 rising; his defeat at Culloden in April 1746 effectively ended the Stuart cause, and subsequent attempts failed to materialise, such as a planned French invasion in 1759.[2] His escape from Scotland after the uprising led to his portrayal as a romantic figure of heroic failure.[3]","image":"Lost_Portrait_of_Charles_Edward_Stuart.jpg.webp"}
