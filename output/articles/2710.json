{"title":"Alcohol by volume","summary":"Alcohol by volume (abbreviated as ABV, abv, or alc/vol) is a standard measure of how much alcohol (ethanol) is contained in a given volume of an alcoholic beverage (expressed as a volume percent).[1][2][3] It is defined as the number of millilitres (mL) of pure ethanol present in 100 ml (3.5 imp fl oz; 3.4 US fl oz) of solution at 20 °C (68 °F). The number of millilitres of pure ethanol is the mass of the ethanol divided by its density at 20 °C (68 °F), which is 0.78924 g/ml (0.45621 oz/cu in). The ABV standard is used worldwide.  The International Organization of Legal Metrology has tables of density of water–ethanol mixtures at different concentrations and temperatures.","image":"Absinthe_ABV.jpg.webp","url":"Alcohol_by_volume"}
