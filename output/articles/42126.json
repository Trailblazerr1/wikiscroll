{"title":"State church of the Roman Empire","summary":"The state church of the Roman Empire refers to the church approved by the Roman emperors after Theodosius I issued the Edict of Thessalonica in 380,[1] which recognized the catholic orthodoxy[lower-alpha 1] of Nicene Christians in the Great Church as the Roman Empire's state religion.[3][4][5][6] Most historians refer to the Nicene church associated with emperors in a variety of ways: as the catholic church, the orthodox church, the imperial church, the imperial Roman church, or the Byzantine church although some of those terms are also used for wider communions extending outside the Roman Empire.[7] The Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Catholic Church all claim to stand in continuity from the Nicene church to which Theodosius granted recognition, but do not consider it to be a creation of the Roman Empire.","image":"Christian_cross.svg.png.webp","url":"State_church_of_the_Roman_Empire"}
