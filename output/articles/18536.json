{"title":"Gorilla","summary":"Gorillas are herbivorous,  predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.","image":"Gorille_des_plaines_de_l'ouest_Ã _l'Espace_Zoologique.jpg.webp","url":"Gorilla"}
