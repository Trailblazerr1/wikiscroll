{"title":"Communication","summary":"Communication (from Latin communicare, meaning \"to share\" or \"to be in relation with\")[1][2][3] is \"an apparent answer to the painful divisions between self and other, private and public, and inner thought and outer world.\"[4] As this definition indicates, communication is difficult to define in a consistent manner,[5][6] because it is commonly used to refer to a wide range of different behaviors (broadly: \"the transfer of information\"[7]), or to limit what can be included in the category of communication (for example, requiring a \"conscious intent\" to persuade[8]). John Peters argues the difficulty of defining communication emerges from the fact that communication is both a universal phenomenon (because everyone communicates) and a specific discipline of institutional academic study.[9]","image":"Pioneer_plaque.svg.png.webp","url":"Communication"}
