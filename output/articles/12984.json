{"title":"Digital distribution of video games","summary":"In the video game industry, digital distribution is the process of delivering video game content as digital information, without the exchange or purchase of new physical media such as ROM cartridges, magnetic storage, optical discs and flash memory cards. This process has existed since the early 1980s, but it was only with network advancements in bandwidth capabilities in the early 2000s that digital distribution became more prominent as a method of selling games. Currently, the process is dominated by online distribution over broadband Internet.","image":"Video-Game-Controller-Icon-IDV-green-industry.svg.png.webp","url":"Digital_distribution_of_video_games"}
