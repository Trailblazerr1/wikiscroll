{"title":"Social network analysis","summary":"Social network analysis (SNA) is the process of investigating social structures  through the use of networks and graph theory.[1] It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them.  Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks,[2][3] memes spread,[4] information circulation,[5] friendship and acquaintance networks, business networks, knowledge networks,[6][7] difficult working relationships,[8] social networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission, and sexual relationships.[9][10] These networks are often visualized through sociograms in which nodes are represented as points and ties are represented as lines. These visualizations provide a means of qualitatively assessing networks by varying the visual representation of their nodes and edges to reflect attributes of interest.[11]","image":"Social_Network_Diagram_(segment).svg.png.webp","url":"Social_network_analysis"}
