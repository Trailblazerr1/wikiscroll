{"title":"Fluorescent lamp","summary":"A fluorescent lamp, or fluorescent tube, is a low-pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp that uses fluorescence to produce visible light. An electric current in the gas excites mercury vapor, which produces short-wave ultraviolet light that then causes a phosphor coating on the inside of the lamp to glow. A fluorescent lamp converts electrical energy into useful light much more efficiently than an incandescent lamp. The typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50â€“100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output.  In comparison, the luminous efficacy of an incandescent bulb is only 16 lumens per watt.","image":"Fluorescent_lamps_artistic.jpg.webp","url":"Fluorescent_lamp"}
