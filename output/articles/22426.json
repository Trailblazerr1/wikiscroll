{"title":"Iris (anatomy)","summary":"In humans and most mammals and birds, the iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, annular structure in the eye, responsible for controlling the diameter and size of the pupil, thus the amount of light reaching the retina. Eye color is defined by that of the iris. In optical terms, the pupil is the eye's aperture, while the iris is the diaphragm.","image":"A_blue_eye.jpg.webp","url":"Iris_(anatomy)"}
