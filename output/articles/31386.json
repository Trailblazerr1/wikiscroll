{"title":"National Investigation Agency","summary":"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is India's counter-terrorist task force.[3] The agency is empowered to deal with terror related crimes across states without special permission from the states. The Agency came into existence with the enactment of the National Investigation Agency Act 2008 by the Parliament of India on 31 December 2008, which was passed after the deadly 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai. Such an attack revealed the failure of intelligence and ability to track such activities by existing agencies in India, hence the government of India realized the need of a specific body to deal with terror related activities in India, thereby establishing the NIA.[4][5][6][7] Headquartered in New Delhi, the NIA has branches in Hyderabad, Guwahati, Kochi, Lucknow, Mumbai, Kolkata, Raipur and Jammu.[8] It maintains the NIA Most Wanted list.","image":"NIA_Headquarters_in_New_Delhi.jpg.webp","url":"National_Investigation_Agency"}
