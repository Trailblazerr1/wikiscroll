{"title":"Pāramitā","summary":"Pāramitā (Sanskrit, Pali) or pāramī (Pāli), is a Buddhist term often translated as \"perfection\". It is described in Buddhist commentaries as noble character qualities generally associated with enlightened beings. Pāramī and pāramitā are both terms in Pali but Pali literature makes greater reference to pāramī, while Mahayana texts generally use the Sanskrit pāramitā.[1][2]","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp"}
