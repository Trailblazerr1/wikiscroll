{"title":"Demyelinating disease","summary":"A demyelinating disease is any disease of the nervous system in which the myelin sheath of neurons is damaged.[1]  This damage impairs the conduction of signals in the affected nerves. In turn, the reduction in conduction ability causes deficiency in sensation, movement, cognition, or other functions depending on which nerves are involved.","image":"MS_Demyelinisation_CD68_10xv2.jpg.webp","url":"Demyelinating_disease"}
