{"title":"Mime artist","summary":"A mime artist or just mime (from Greek μῖμος, mimos, \"imitator, actor\")[1] is a person who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a performance art. Miming involves acting out a story through body motions, without the use of speech. In earlier times, in English, such a performer would typically be referred to as a mummer. Miming is distinguished from silent comedy, in which the artist is a character in a film or skit without sound.","image":"Mime_artist_and_actor_Martin_Kent.jpg.webp","url":"Mime_artist"}
