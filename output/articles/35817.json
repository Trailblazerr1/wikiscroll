{"title":"Predatory publishing","summary":"Predatory publishing, also write-only publishing[1][2] or deceptive publishing,[3] is an exploitative academic publishing business model that involves charging publication fees to authors without checking articles for quality and legitimacy, and without providing editorial and publishing services that legitimate academic journals provide, whether open access or not. The phenomenon of \"open access predatory publishers\" was first noticed by Jeffrey Beall, when he described \"publishers that are ready to publish any article for payment\".[4] However, criticisms about the label \"predatory\" have been raised.[5] A lengthy review of the controversy started by Beall appears in The Journal of Academic Librarianship.[6]","image":"page1-220px-Think-check-submit_Poster_1.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Predatory_publishing"}
