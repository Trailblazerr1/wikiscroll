{"title":"Burmese alphabet","summary":"The Burmese alphabet (Burmese: မြန်မာအက္ခရာ, pronounced [mjəmà ʔɛʔkʰəjà]) is an abugida used for writing Burmese. It is ultimately a Brahmic script adapted from either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabet of South India and more immediately an adaptation of Rakhinese(Arakanese) script and Pyu script or Old Mon script. The Burmese alphabet is also used for the liturgical languages of Pali and Sanskrit.","image":"Burmese_script_sample.svg.png.webp"}
