{"title":"Treaty of Amiens","summary":"The Treaty of Amiens (French: la paix d'Amiens) temporarily ended hostilities between France and the United Kingdom at the end of the War of the Second Coalition. It marked the end of the French Revolutionary Wars; after a short peace it set the stage for the Napoleonic Wars.  Britain gave up most of its recent conquests; France was to evacuate Naples and Egypt. Britain retained Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Trinidad. It was signed in the city of Amiens on 27 March 1802 (4 Germinal X in the French Revolutionary calendar) by Joseph Bonaparte and Marquess Cornwallis as a \"Definitive Treaty of Peace.\" The consequent peace lasted only one year (18 May 1803) and was the only period of general peace in Europe between 1793 and 1814.","image":"Gillray_-_The_First_Kiss.jpg.webp","url":"Treaty_of_Amiens"}
