{"title":"Multiplexer","summary":"In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux; spelled sometimes as multiplexor), also known as a data selector, is a device that selects between several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output line.[1] The selection is directed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines. A multiplexer of 2 n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}} inputs has n {\\displaystyle n} select lines, which are used to select which input line to send to the output.[2]","image":"8226f30650ee4fe4e640c6d2798127e80e9c160d.svg","url":"Multiplexer"}
