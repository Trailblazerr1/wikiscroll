{"title":"Bogd Khanate of Mongolia","summary":"The Bogd Khanate of Mongolia (Mongolian: Богд хаант Монгол Улс; Chinese: 博克多汗國) was the government of Outer Mongolia between 1911 and 1919 and again from 1921 to 1924. By the spring of 1911, some prominent Mongol nobles including Prince Tögs-Ochiryn Namnansüren persuaded the Jebstundamba Khutukhtu to convene a meeting of nobles and ecclesiastical officials to discuss independence from Qing China. On 30 November 1911 the Mongols established the Temporary Government of Khalkha. On 29 December 1911 the Mongols declared their independence from the collapsing Qing Empire following the Xinhai Revolution. They installed as theocratic sovereign the 8th Bogd Gegeen, highest authority of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia, who took the title Bogd Khaan or \"Holy Ruler\".[2] The Bogd Khaan was last khagan of the Mongols. This ushered in the period of \"Theocratic Mongolia\",[3] and the realm of the Bogd Khan is usually known as the \"Bogd Khanate\".[4]","image":"Monggol_ulus.svg.png.webp"}
