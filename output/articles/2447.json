{"title":"Ahmad Shah Durrani","summary":"Ahmad Shāh Durrānī (b. 1722 – 16 October 1772 d.) (Dari: احمد شاه درانی; Pashto: احمد شاه دراني), also known as Ahmad Shah Abdālī, or Ahmad Khān Abdālī, (Dari: احمد خان ابدالی; Pashto: احمد خان ابدالي), was the founder of the Durrani Empire and is regarded as the founder of the modern state of Afghanistan.[12][13][14] In July 1747, Ahmad Shah was appointed as the King of Afghanistan by a loya jirga in Kandahar, where he set up his capital.[1] Assisted by a council of nine advisers from various Afghan tribes,[15] Ahmad Shah pushed east towards the Mughal and Maratha Empires of India, west towards the disintegrating Afsharid Empire of Iran, and north towards the Khanate of Bukhara of Turkestan. Within a few years, he extended his control from Khorasan in the west to Kashmir and North India in the east, and from the Amu Darya in the north to the Arabian Sea in the south.[13][16]","image":"Portrait_of_Ahmad_Shah_Durrani.jpg.webp","url":"Ahmad_Shah_Durrani"}
