{"title":"Equivalence class","summary":"In mathematics, when the elements of some set \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n have a notion of equivalence (formalized as an equivalence relation) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n into equivalence classes. These equivalence classes are constructed so that elements \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        b\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle b}\n  \n belong to the same equivalence class if, and only if, they are equivalent.","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg"}
