{"title":"Pyrrole","summary":"Pyrrole is a heterocyclic aromatic organic compound, a five-membered ring with the formula C4H4NH.[3] It is a colorless volatile liquid that darkens readily upon exposure to air. Substituted derivatives are also called pyrroles, e.g., N-methylpyrrole, C4H4NCH3. Porphobilinogen, a trisubstituted pyrrole, is the biosynthetic precursor to many natural products such as heme.[4]","image":"Pyrrole-2D-full.svg.png.webp"}
