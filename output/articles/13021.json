{"title":"Dillo","summary":"Dillo is a minimalistic web browser particularly intended for older or slower computers and embedded systems.[2] It supports only plain HTML/XHTML (with CSS rendering) and images over HTTP; scripting is ignored entirely.[2][3] Current versions of Dillo can run on Linux, BSD, OS X, IRIX and Cygwin.[4] Due to its small size, it is the browser of choice in several space-conscious Linux distributions. Released under the GNU GPL-3.0-or-later, Dillo is free software.[5]","image":"Dillo-icon.png.webp"}
