{"title":"Khmer Empire","summary":"The Khmer Empire (Khmer: ចក្រភពខ្មែរ), or the Angkorian Empire (Khmer: ចក្រភពអង្គរ), are the terms that historians use to refer to Cambodia from the 9th century to the 15th century when the nation was a Hindu/Buddhist empire in Southeast Asia. The empire grew out of the former civilizations of Funan and Chenla, at times ruled over and/or vassalised most of mainland Southeast Asia[3] and parts of Southern China, stretching from the tip of the Indochinese Peninsula northward to modern Yunnan province, China, and from Vietnam westward to Myanmar.[4][5]  At its peak, the Khmer Empire was larger than the Byzantine Empire(Eastern Roman Empire) which existed around the same time.[6]","image":"Flag_of_Cambodia_(pre-1863).svg.png.webp","url":"Khmer_Empire"}
