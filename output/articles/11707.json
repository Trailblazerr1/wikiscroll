{"title":"Cuphead","summary":"Cuphead is a 2017 run-and-gun video game developed and published by Studio MDHR. The game was inspired by the rubber hose style of animation used in cartoons from the golden age of American animation, such as the works of Walt Disney Animation Studios and Fleischer Studios, and it sought to emulate their subversive and surrealist qualities.","image":"Cuphead_(artwork).jpg.webp","url":"Cuphead"}
