{"title":"Scott Joplin","summary":"Scott Joplin (c. November 24, 1868 â€“ April 1, 1917) was an African-American composer and pianist.[1] Joplin is also known as the \"King of Ragtime\" because of the fame achieved for his ragtime compositions, music that was born out of the African-American community.[2] During his brief career, he wrote over 100 original ragtime pieces, one ragtime ballet, and two operas. One of his first and most popular pieces, the \"Maple Leaf Rag\", became ragtime's first and most influential hit, and has been recognized as the archetypal rag.[3]","image":"Scott_Joplin.jpg.webp","url":"Scott_Joplin"}
