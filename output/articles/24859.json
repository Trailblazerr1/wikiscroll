{"title":"Kingdom of Hungary (1301–1526)","summary":"In the Late Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Hungary, a country in Central Europe, experienced a period of interregnum in the early 14th century. Royal power was restored under Charles I (1308–1342), a scion of the Capetian House of Anjou. Gold and silver mines opened in his reign produced about one third of the world's total production up until the 1490s. The kingdom reached the peak of its power under Louis the Great (1342–1382) who led military campaigns against Lithuania, southern Italy and other faraway territories.","image":"Flag_of_Louis_II_of_Hungary.svg.png.webp","url":"Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1301–1526)"}
