{"title":"Speed of sound","summary":"The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit of time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. At 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second (1,125 ft/s; 1,235 km/h; 767 mph; 667 kn), or one kilometre in 2.9 s or one mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagating. At 0 °C (32 °F), the speed of sound is about 331 m/s (1,086 ft/s; 1,192 km/h; 740 mph; 643 kn).[1]","image":"FA-18_Hornet_breaking_sound_barrier_(7_July_1999)_-_filtered.jpg.webp"}
