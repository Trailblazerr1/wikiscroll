{"title":"Celts","summary":"The Celts (/kɛlts, sɛlts/, see pronunciation of Celt for different usages) are[1] a collection of Indo-European peoples[2] in parts of Europe and Anatolia identified by their use of the Celtic languages and other cultural similarities.[3][4][5][6] Historic Celtic groups included the Gauls, Celtiberians, Gallaecians,[7][8] Galatians, Britons, Gaels, and their offshoots. The relationship between ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world is unclear and controversial.[9] In particular, there is dispute over the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts.[6][9][10][11]","image":"Scuto_Battersea_BritMu252a.jpg.webp","url":"Celts"}
