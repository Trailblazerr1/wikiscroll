{"title":"Dominion (card game)","summary":"Dominion is a deck-building game created by Donald X. Vaccarino and published by Rio Grande Games. It was the first game of its kind, and inspired a genre of games building on its central mechanic.[1] Each player begins with a small deck of cards, which they improve by purchasing cards from a common supply that varies from game to game. Cards can help the player's deck function, impede their opponents, or provide Victory Points.","image":"Dominion_game.jpg.webp"}
