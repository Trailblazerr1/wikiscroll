{"title":"Power Mac G4 Cube","summary":"The Power Mac G4 Cube is a Macintosh personal computer sold by Apple Computer, Inc. between July 2000 and 2001. Designed by Jonathan Ive, the Cube was conceived by Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who held an interest in a powerful, miniaturized desktop computer. Apple's designers developed new technologies and manufacturing methods for the product—a 7.7-inch (20 cm) cubic computer housed in clear acrylic glass. Apple positioned the Cube in the middle of its product range, between the consumer iMac G3 and the professional Power Mac G4. The Cube was announced at the Macworld Expo on July 19, 2000.","image":"Power_mac_g4_cube.png.webp"}
