{"title":"Fossil fuel phase-out","summary":"Fossil fuel phase-out is the gradual reduction of the use and production of fossil fuels to zero. It is part of the ongoing renewable energy transition. Current efforts in fossil fuel phase-out involve replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources in sectors such as transport, and heating. Alternatives to fossil fuels include electrification, green hydrogen and aviation biofuel. Phase-out policies include both demand-side and supply-side constraints,[3] whereas demand-side approaches seek to reduce fossil-fuel consumption, supply-side initiatives seek to constraint production to accelerate the pace of energy transition and reduction in emissions.","image":"20210119_Renewable_energy_investment_-_2004-_BloombergNEF.svg.png.webp","url":"Fossil_fuel_phase-out"}
