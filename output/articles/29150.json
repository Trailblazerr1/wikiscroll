{"title":"Median lethal dose","summary":"In toxicology, the median lethal dose, LD50 (abbreviation for \"lethal dose, 50%\"), LC50 (lethal concentration, 50%) or LCt50 is a measure of the lethal dose of a toxin, radiation, or pathogen.[1] The value of LD50 for a substance is the dose required to kill half the members of a tested population after a specified test duration. LD50 figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's acute toxicity.  A lower LD50 is indicative of increased toxicity.","image":"Poison-Scale-long.jpg.webp","url":"Median_lethal_dose"}
