{"title":"Gemini 4","summary":"Gemini 4 (officially Gemini IV)[3] was the second crewed spaceflight in NASA's Project Gemini, occurring in June 1965. It was the tenth crewed American spaceflight (including two X-15 flights at altitudes exceeding 100 kilometers (54Â nmi)). Astronauts James McDivitt and Ed White circled the Earth 66 times in four days, making it the first US flight to approach the five-day flight of the Soviet Vostok 5. The highlight of the mission was the first space walk by an American, during which White floated free outside the spacecraft, tethered to it, for approximately 20 minutes.","image":"Ed_White_First_American_Spacewalker_-_GPN-2000-001180.jpg.webp","url":"Gemini_4"}
