{"title":"Radical (chemistry)","summary":"In chemistry, a radical is an atom, molecule, or ion that has at least one unpaired valence electron.[1][2]\nWith some exceptions, these unpaired electrons make radicals highly chemically reactive.  Many radicals spontaneously dimerize.  Most organic radicals have short lifetimes.","image":"Hydroxyl_radical.png.webp"}
