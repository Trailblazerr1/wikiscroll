{"title":"Super Tuesday","summary":"Super Tuesday is the United States presidential primary election day in February or March when the greatest number of U.S. states hold primary elections and caucuses. Approximately one-third of all delegates to the presidential nominating conventions can be won on Super Tuesday, more than on any other day. The results on Super Tuesday are therefore a strong indicator of the likely eventual nominee of each political party.","image":"Super_Tuesday_Ballots_in_Massachusetts.jpg.webp","url":"Super_Tuesday"}
