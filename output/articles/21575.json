{"title":"Idiom","summary":"An idiom is a phrase or expression that typically presents a figurative, non-literal meaning attached to the phrase; but some phrases become figurative idioms while retaining the literal meaning of the phrase. Categorized as formulaic language, an idiom's figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning.[1] Idioms occur frequently in all languages; in English alone there are an estimated twenty-five thousand idiomatic expressions.[2]","image":"Donato_Barcaglia%2C_Liebe_macht_blind%2C_Ausschnitt.jpg.webp","url":"Idiom"}
