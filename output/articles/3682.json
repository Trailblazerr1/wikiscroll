{"title":"Angioplasty","summary":"Angioplasty, also known as balloon angioplasty and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), is a minimally invasive endovascular procedure used to widen narrowed or obstructed arteries or veins, typically to treat arterial atherosclerosis.[1] A deflated balloon attached to a catheter (a balloon catheter) is passed over a guide-wire into the narrowed vessel and then inflated to a fixed size.[1] The balloon forces expansion of the blood vessel and the surrounding muscular wall, allowing an improved blood flow.[1] A stent may be inserted at the time of ballooning to ensure the vessel remains open, and the balloon is then deflated and withdrawn.[2] Angioplasty has come to include all manner of vascular interventions that are typically performed percutaneously.","image":"Angioplasty-scheme.svg.png.webp"}
