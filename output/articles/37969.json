{"title":"Right angle","summary":"In geometry and trigonometry, a right angle is an angle of exactly 90 degrees or Ï€/2 radians[1] corresponding to a quarter turn.[2] If a ray is placed so that its endpoint is on a line and the adjacent angles are equal, then they are right angles.[3] The term is a calque of Latin angulus rectus; here rectus means \"upright\", referring to the vertical perpendicular to a horizontal base line.","image":"Right_angle.svg.png.webp"}
