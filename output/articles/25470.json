{"title":"Landscape photography","summary":"Landscape photography shows the  spaces within the world, sometimes vast and unending, but other times microscopic. Landscape photographs typically capture the presence of nature but can also focus on man-made features or disturbances of landscapes. Landscape photography is done for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most common is to recall a personal observation or experience while in the outdoors, especially when traveling. Others pursue it particularly as an outdoor lifestyle, to be involved with nature and the elements, some as an escape from the artificial world.[1][2][3][4]","image":"Adams_The_Tetons_and_the_Snake_River.jpg.webp"}
