{"title":"Thiamine","summary":"Thiamine, also known as thiamin or vitamin B1, is a vitamin found in food and manufactured as a dietary supplement and medication.[1][3] Food sources of thiamine include whole grains, legumes, and some meats and fish.[1] Grain processing removes much of the thiamine content, so in many countries cereals and flours are enriched with thiamine.[1][4] Supplements and medications are available to treat and prevent thiamine deficiency and disorders that result from it, including beriberi and Wernicke encephalopathy.[5] Other uses include the treatment of maple syrup urine disease and Leigh syndrome.[5] They are typically taken by mouth, but may also be given by intravenous or intramuscular injection.[5][6]","image":"Thiamin.svg.png.webp","url":"Thiamine"}
