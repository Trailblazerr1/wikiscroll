{"title":"Cleveland Torso Murderer","summary":"The Cleveland Torso Murderer, also known as the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run, was an unidentified serial killer who was active in Cleveland, Ohio, United States, in the 1930s. The killings were characterized by the dismemberment of twelve known victims and the disposal of their remains in the impoverished neighborhood of Kingsbury Run.[1] Most victims came from an area east of Kingsbury Run called \"The Roaring Third\" or \"Hobo Jungle\", known for its bars, gambling dens, brothels, and vagrants. Despite an investigation of the murders, which at one time was led by famed lawman Eliot Ness, then Cleveland's Public Safety Director,[2] the murderer was never apprehended.[3]","image":"Death_Mask_Display.jpg.webp","url":"Cleveland_Torso_Murderer"}
