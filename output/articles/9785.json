{"title":"Chough","summary":"There are two species of passerine birds commonly called chough (/tʃʌf/ CHUF) that constitute the genus Pyrrhocorax of the Corvidae (crow) family of birds. These are the red-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), and the Alpine chough (or yellow-billed chough) (Pyrrhocorax graculus). The white-winged chough of Australia, despite its name, is not a true chough but rather a member of the family Corcoracidae and only distantly related.","image":"Chough_(Pyrrhocorax_pyrrhocorax)_(8).jpg.webp","url":"Chough"}
