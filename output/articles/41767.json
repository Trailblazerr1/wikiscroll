{"title":"Spiritual Assembly","summary":"Spiritual Assembly is a term given by ʻAbdu'l-Bahá to refer to elected councils that govern the Baháʼí Faith. Because the Baháʼí Faith has no clergy, they carry out the affairs of the community.  In addition to existing at the local level, there are national Spiritual Assemblies (although \"national\" in some cases refers to a portion of a country or to a group of countries). Spiritual Assemblies form part of the elected branch of the Baháʼí administration.[1]","image":"Bahai_star.svg.png.webp"}
