{"title":"Æthelred the Unready","summary":"Æthelred (Old English: Æþelræd, pronounced [ˈæðelræːd];[n 1] c. 966 – 23 April 1016), known as the Unready, was King of the English from 978 to 1013 and again from 1014 until his death in 1016. His epithet does not derive from the modern word \"unready\", but rather from the Old English unræd meaning \"poorly advised\"; it is a pun on his name, which means \"well advised\".","image":"Ethelred_the_Unready.jpg.webp","url":"Æthelred_the_Unready"}
