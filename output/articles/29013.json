{"title":"Maximilien Robespierre","summary":"Maximilien François Marie Isidore de Robespierre (French: [mak.si.mi.ljɛ̃  ʁɔ.bɛs.pjɛʁ]; 6 May 1758 – 28 July 1794) was a French lawyer and statesman who was one of the best-known and most influential figures of the French Revolution. As a member of  the Constituent Assembly and the Jacobin Club, he campaigned for universal manhood suffrage[1] and the abolition both of celibacy for the clergy, and slavery. In 1791, Robespierre was elected as \"public accuser\" and became an outspoken advocate for male citizens without a political voice, for their unrestricted admission to the National Guard, to public offices,  for the right to petition and the right to bear arms in self defence.[2][3][4] Robespierre played an important part in the agitation which brought about the fall of the French monarchy on 10 August 1792 and the summoning of a National Convention.[5] His goal was to create a one and indivisible France, equality before the law, to abolish prerogatives and to defend the principles of direct democracy.[6]","image":"Robespierre.jpg.webp","url":"Maximilien_Robespierre"}
