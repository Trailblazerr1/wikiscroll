{"title":"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate","summary":"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP, or 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of  adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway.  It should not be confused with 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMP-activated protein kinase).","image":"Cyclic-AMPchemdraw.png.webp","url":"Cyclic_adenosine_monophosphate"}
