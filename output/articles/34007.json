{"title":"Partial pressure","summary":"In a mixture of gases, each constituent gas has a partial pressure which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature.[1] The total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture (Dalton's Law).","image":"398f438d75434e6fbf48dc232c1ad7228a738568.svg"}
