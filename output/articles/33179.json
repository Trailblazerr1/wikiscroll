{"title":"Optimal foraging theory","summary":"Optimal foraging theory (OFT) is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food.  Although obtaining food provides the animal with energy, searching for and capturing the food require both energy and time.  To maximize fitness, an animal adopts a foraging strategy that provides the most benefit (energy) for the lowest cost, maximizing the net energy gained.  OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.","image":"Abeille_butinant_une_fleur_3.JPG.webp","url":"Optimal_foraging_theory"}
