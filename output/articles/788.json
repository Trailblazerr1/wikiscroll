{"title":"21 (Adele album)","summary":"21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. It was released on 24 January 2011[1] in Europe by XL Recordings and on 22 February 2011 in North America by Columbia Records. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the Motown/soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but also draws influence from the American country and Southern blues music that Adele started listening to while on the North American leg of her tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album exemplifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter, exploring themes of heartbreak, healing and forgiveness.","image":"Adele_-_21.png.webp"}
