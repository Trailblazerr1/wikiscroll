{"title":"Sword","summary":"A sword is an edged, bladed weapon intended for manual cutting or thrusting.  Its blade, longer than a knife or dagger, is attached to a hilt and can be straight or curved. A thrusting sword tends to have a straighter blade with a pointed tip. A slashing sword is more likely to be curved and to have a sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing. The precise definition of a sword varies by  historical epoch and geographic region.","image":"Espadon-Morges.jpg.webp"}
