{"title":"Initialization vector","summary":"In cryptography, an initialization vector (IV) or starting variable (SV)[1] is an input to a cryptographic primitive being used to provide the initial state. The IV is typically required to be random or pseudorandom, but sometimes an IV only needs to be unpredictable or unique. Randomization is crucial for some encryption schemes to achieve semantic security, a property whereby repeated usage of the scheme under the same key does not allow an attacker to infer relationships between (potentially similar) segments of the encrypted message. For block ciphers, the use of an IV is described by the modes of operation.","image":"Tux_ecb.jpg.webp","url":"Initialization_vector"}
