{"title":"Wild boar","summary":"The wild boar (Sus scrofa), also known as the wild swine,[3] common wild pig,[4] Eurasian wild pig[5], or simply wild pig,[6] is a suid native to much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to the Americas and Oceania. The species is now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widespread suiform.[4] It has been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability to a diversity of habitats.[1] It has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. Wild boars probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene[7] and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the Old World.[8]","image":"Wildschwein%2C_NÃ¤he_Pulverstampftor_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Wild_boar"}
