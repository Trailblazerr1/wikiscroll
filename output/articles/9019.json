{"title":"Cell junction","summary":"Cell junctions (or intercellular bridges[1]) are a class of cellular structures consisting of multiprotein complexes that provide contact or adhesion between neighboring cells or between a cell and the extracellular matrix in animals. They also maintain the paracellular barrier of epithelia and control paracellular transport. Cell junctions are especially abundant in epithelial tissues. Combined with cell adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix, cell junctions help hold animal cells together.","image":"Cell_junction_simplified_en.svg.png.webp"}
