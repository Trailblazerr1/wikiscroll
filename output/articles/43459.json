{"title":"Tau (particle)","summary":"The tau (τ), also called the tau lepton, tau particle, or tauon, is an elementary particle similar to the electron, with negative electric charge and a spin of 1/2. Like the electron, the muon, and the three neutrinos, the tau is a lepton, and like all elementary particles with half-integer spin, the tau has a corresponding antiparticle of opposite charge but equal mass and spin. In the tau's case, this is the \"antitau\" (also called the positive tau). Tau particles are denoted by the symbol τ− and the antitaus by τ+.","image":"Feynman_diagram_of_decay_of_tau_lepton.svg.png.webp","url":"Tau_(particle)"}
