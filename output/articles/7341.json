{"title":"Bounded rationality","summary":"Bounded rationality is the idea that rationality is limited when individuals make decisions. In other words, humans' \"preferences are determined by changes in outcomes relative to a certain reference level\".[1] Limitations include the difficulty of the problem requiring a decision, the cognitive capability of the mind, and the time available to make the decision. Decision-makers, in this view, act as satisficers, seeking a satisfactory solution, rather than an optimal solution. Therefore, humans do not undertake a full cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal decision, but rather, choose an option that fulfils their adequacy criteria.[2]","image":"8def9b6d2f0acfca452861c11dc2a08419765efe.svg","url":"Bounded_rationality"}
