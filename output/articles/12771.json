{"title":"Development aid","summary":"Development aid is aid given by governments and other agencies to support the economic, environmental, social, and political development of developing countries.[1] Closely-related concepts include: foreign aid, international aid, overseas aid, developmental aid, development assistance, official development assistance (ODA), development cooperation and technical assistance. It is distinguished from humanitarian aid by aiming at a sustained improvement in the conditions in a developing country, rather than short-term relief. Development aid is thus widely seen as a major way to meet Sustainable Development Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere) for the developing nations.","image":"Development-assistance-as-share-of-government-expense.png.webp","url":"Development_aid"}
