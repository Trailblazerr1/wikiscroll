The band currently consists of lead vocalist Hayley Williams, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro. Williams and Farro are founding members of the group, while York, a high school friend of the original lineup, joined in 2007. The band are signed to Fueled by Ramen, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, both owned by Warner Music Group. Williams is separately signed to Atlantic as she was scouted when she was a teenager, and they were the only label to let her stay in the band instead of going solo, but Atlantic said the rest of the band had to sign to FBR. She is also the only member to appear on all five of Paramore's studio albums.[1]","image":"Paramore_-_The_O2_-_Friday_12th_January_2018_DSC03984ParamoreO2Jan18_(25112969047).jpg.webp","url":"Paramore"}
