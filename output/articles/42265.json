{"title":"Stereographic projection","summary":"In geometry, the stereographic projection is a particular mapping (function) that projects a sphere onto a plane. The projection is defined on the entire sphere, except at one point: the projection point. Where it is defined, the mapping is smooth and bijective. It is conformal, meaning that it preserves angles at which curves meet.  It is neither isometric nor area-preserving: that is, it preserves neither distances nor the areas of figures.","image":"Stereographic_projection_in_3D.svg.png.webp","url":"Stereographic_projection"}
