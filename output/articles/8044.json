{"title":"CAS Registry Number","summary":"A CAS Registry Number,[1] also referred to as CAS RN[2] or informally CAS Number, is a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) to every chemical substance described in the open scientific literature. Currently it includes all substances described from 1957 through the present, plus some substances from as far back as the early 1800s.[3] It includes organic and inorganic compounds, minerals, isotopes, alloys, mixtures, and nonstructurable materials (UVCBs, substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, or biological origin).[4] CAS RNs are generally serial numbers (with a check digit), so they do not contain any information about the structures themselves the way SMILES and InChI strings do.","image":"Wikidata-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"CAS_Registry_Number"}
