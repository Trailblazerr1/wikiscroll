{"title":"Titin","summary":"Titin /ˈtaɪtɪn/, also known as connectin, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TTN gene.[5][6]  Titin is a giant protein, greater than 1 µm in length,[7] that functions as a molecular spring which is responsible for the passive elasticity of muscle. It comprises 244 individually folded protein domains connected by unstructured peptide sequences.[8] These domains unfold when the protein is stretched and refold when the tension is removed.[9]","image":"1BPV.png.webp","url":"Titin"}
