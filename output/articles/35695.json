{"title":"Postpartum period","summary":"The postpartum (or postnatal) period begins immediately after childbirth as the mother's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, returns to a non-pregnant state.[1] The terms puerperium, puerperal period, or immediate postpartum period are commonly used to refer to the first six weeks following childbirth.[2] The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most maternal and newborn deaths occur during this period.[3] In scientific literature, the term is commonly abbreviated to Px, where x is a number; for example, \"day P5\" should be read as \"the fifth day after birth\". This is not to be confused with the medical nomenclature that uses G P to stand for number and outcomes of pregnancy (gravidity and parity).","image":"Mother_and_newborn_child_in_Orissa.jpg.webp"}
