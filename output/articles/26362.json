{"title":"List of Australian Open men's singles champions","summary":"The Australian Open[lower-alpha 1][lower-alpha 2] is an annual tennis tournament created in 1905 and played on outdoor hardcourts[lower-alpha 3][lower-alpha 4] at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia.[7] The Australian Open is played over a two-week period beginning in mid-January and has been chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tournaments each year since 1987. The event was not held from 1916 to 1918 because of World War I, from 1941 to 1945 because of World War II and in 1986.[2][8] The timing of the Australian Open has changed several times.  In 1977, the date of the final moved from January to December, which resulted in having two Australian Opens in 1977; there was a January edition and a December edition that year.[9] The originally planned December 1986 edition was moved forward to January 1987, resulting in no Australian Open in 1986.[10][11] The Australian Open was an Open Era event for the first time in 1969. One year previously in 1968 the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open were Open Era events for the first time.","image":"James_Anderson_at_the_1922_Davis_Cup.jpg.webp"}
