{"title":"Human impact on the environment","summary":"Human impact on the environment or anthropogenic impact on the environment includes changes to biophysical environments[1] and to ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources[2][3] caused directly or indirectly by humans, including global warming,[1][4] environmental degradation[1] (such as ocean acidification[1][5]), mass extinction and biodiversity loss,[6][7][8][9] ecological crisis, and ecological collapse. Modifying the environment to fit the needs of society is causing severe effects.[10][11] Some human activities that cause damage (either directly or indirectly) to the environment on a global scale include population growth,[12][13] overconsumption, overexploitation, pollution, and deforestation. Some of the problems, including global warming and biodiversity loss, have been proposed as representing catastrophic risks to the survival of the human race.[14][15]","image":"Satellite_image_of_2019_Southeast_Asian_haze_in_Borneo_-_20190915.jpg.webp"}
