{"title":"Operation Wetback","summary":"Operation Wetback was an immigration law enforcement initiative created by Joseph Swing, the Director of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), in cooperation with the Mexican government. The program was implemented in June 1954 by U.S. Attorney General Herbert Brownell.[1] The implementation of Operation Wetback was a result of Attorney General Henry Brownell's touring of Southern California in August of 1953. It was here that he made note of the \"shocking and unsettling\" issue that was illegal immigration.[2] The short-lived operation used military-style tactics to remove Mexican immigrants—some of them American citizens—from the United States. Though millions of Mexicans had legally entered the country through joint immigration programs in the first half of the 20th century, Operation Wetback was designed to send them back to Mexico.[3]","image":"Operation_Wetback.png.webp"}
