{"title":"Plant nursery","summary":"A nursery is a place where plants are propagated and grown to a desired age. Mostly the plants concerned are for gardening, forestry or conservation biology, rather than agriculture. They include retail nurseries, which sell to the general public, wholesale nurseries, which sell only to businesses such as other nurseries and to commercial gardeners, and private nurseries, which supply the needs of institutions or private estates.  Some will also work in plant breeding.","image":"Cutchogue_-_Oregon_Road_-_Plant_Nursery.jpg.webp"}
