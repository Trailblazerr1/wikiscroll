{"title":"William O. Douglas","summary":"William Orville Douglas (October 16, 1898 – January 19, 1980) was an American jurist and politician who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, who was known for his strong progressive views, and is often cited as the Supreme Court's most liberal justice ever. Nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Douglas was confirmed at the age of 40, one of the youngest justices appointed to the court. His term, lasting 36 years and 211 days (1939–75), is the longest in the history of the Supreme Court. In 1975, Time magazine called Douglas \"the most doctrinaire and committed civil libertarian ever to sit on the court.\"[2]","image":"Justice_William_O_Douglas.jpg.webp","url":"William_O._Douglas"}
