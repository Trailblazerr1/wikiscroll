{"title":"American Water Spaniel","summary":"The American Water Spaniel, (often abbreviated to AWS), is a breed of spaniel which originated in the United States. It was developed in the state of Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.","image":"Chien_d'eau_americain_champion_1.JPG.webp","url":"American_Water_Spaniel"}
