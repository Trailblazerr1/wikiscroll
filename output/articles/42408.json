{"title":"Storming of the Bastille","summary":"The Storming of the Bastille (French: Prise de la Bastille [pʁiz də la bastij]) was an event that occurred in Paris, France, on the afternoon of 14 July 1789, when revolutionaries stormed and seized control of the medieval armory, fortress, and political prison known as the Bastille. At the time, the Bastille represented royal authority in the centre of Paris. The prison contained only seven inmates at the time of its storming, but was seen by the revolutionaries as a symbol of the monarchy's abuse of power; its fall was the flashpoint of the French Revolution.","image":"Prise_de_la_Bastille.jpg.webp","url":"Storming_of_the_Bastille"}
