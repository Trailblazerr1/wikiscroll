{"title":"Antimicrobial resistance","summary":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when microbes evolve mechanisms that protect them from the effects of antimicrobials.[2] Antibiotic resistance  is a subset of AMR, that applies specifically to bacteria that become resistant to antibiotics.[2] Infections caused by resistant microbes are more difficult to treat, requiring higher doses of antimicrobial drugs, or alternative medications which may prove more toxic. These approaches may also be more expensive. Microbes resistant to multiple antimicrobials are called multidrug resistant (MDR).","image":"Antibiotic_sensitivity_and_resistance.jpg.webp","url":"Antimicrobial_resistance"}
