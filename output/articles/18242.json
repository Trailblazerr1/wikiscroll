{"title":"Glockenspiel","summary":"The glockenspiel (German pronunciation: [ˈɡlɔkənˌʃpiːl] or [ˈɡlɔkŋ̍ˌʃpiːl], Glocken: bells and Spiel: Play)[1] is a percussion instrument composed of a set of tuned keys arranged in the fashion of the keyboard of a piano.  In this way, it is similar to the xylophone, although the xylophone's bars are made of wood, while the glockenspiel's are metal plates or tubes, thus making it a metallophone. The glockenspiel, additionally, is usually smaller and, because of both its material and smaller size, higher in pitch.[2]","image":"Glockenspiel.jpg.webp"}
