{"title":"Serif","summary":"In typography, a serif (/ˈsɛrɪf/) is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font or family of fonts. A typeface or \"font family\" making use of serifs is called a serif typeface (or serifed typeface), and a typeface that does not include them is sans-serif. Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as \"grotesque\" (in German, grotesk) or \"Gothic\",[1] and serif typefaces as \"roman\".","image":"Serif_and_sans-serif_01.svg.png.webp"}
