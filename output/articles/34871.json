{"title":"Photolithography","summary":"In integrated circuit manufacturing, photolithography or optical lithography is a general term for techniques that use light to produce minutely patterned thin films of suitable materials over a substrate, such as a silicon wafer, to protect selected areas of it during subsequent etching, deposition, or implantation operations. Typically, ultraviolet light is used to transfer a geometric design from an optical mask to a light-sensitive chemical (photoresist) coated  on the substrate. The photoresist either breaks down or hardens where it is exposed to light. The patterned film is the created by removing the softer parts of the coating with appropriate solvents.","image":"Photolithography_etching_process.svg.png.webp","url":"Photolithography"}
