{"title":"Hyperbaric medicine","summary":"Hyperbaric medicine is medical treatment in which an ambient pressure greater than sea level atmospheric pressure is a necessary component. The treatment comprises hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), the medical use of oxygen at an ambient pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, and therapeutic recompression for decompression illness, intended to reduce the injurious effects of systemic gas bubbles by physically reducing their size and providing improved conditions for elimination of bubbles and excess dissolved gas.","image":"HyperBaric_Oxygen_Therapy_Chamber_2008.jpg.webp","url":"Hyperbaric_medicine"}
