{"title":"Sentence (law)","summary":"The term sentence in law refers to punishment, penalty or physical restraint that was actually imposed or could be ordered by a trial court in a criminal procedure.[1] A sentence forms the final explicit act of a judge-ruled process as well as the symbolic principal act connected to their function. The sentence can generally involve a decree of imprisonment and/or restitution against a defendant convicted of a crime or violation of law. Inmates imprisoned for multiple crimes usually serve a concurrent sentence in which the period of imprisonment equals the length of the longest sentence where the sentences are all served together at the same time, while others serve a consecutive sentence in which the period of imprisonment equals the sum of all the sentences served sequentially, or one after the other.[2] A sentence may be intermediate, which allows an inmate to be free for about 8 hours a day for work purposes; determinate, which is fixed on a number of days, months, or years; and indeterminate or bifurcated,[3] which mandates the minimum period be served in an institutional setting such as a prison with the remaining months or years on parole or supervised release. This latter period is known as \"street time\" in many jurisdictions,[4] which is a rehabilitation process and is the opposite of punishment, penalty or physical restraint because it has been created to help people become educated and productive individuals.[5] It involves similar difficult challenges that students experience in obtaining a work certificate or an academic degree.","image":"Johnny-automatic-scales-of-justice.svg.png.webp","url":"Sentence_(law)"}
