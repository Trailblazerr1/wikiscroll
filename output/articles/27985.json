{"title":"Magical creatures in Harry Potter","summary":"Magical creatures are an aspect of the fictional wizarding world contained in the Harry Potter series and connected media, all created by British author J. K. Rowling. Throughout the seven main books of the series, Harry and his friends encounter many of these creatures on their adventures in Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest, or other locations throughout the Wizarding World. In addition, students learn to take care of creatures such as Hippogriffs and Unicorns in the Care of Magical Creatures class at Hogwarts. Rowling has also written Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a guide to the magical beasts found in the series, and based on the fictional textbook of the same name written by Newt Scamander and used by students at Hogwarts. Many of these creatures are derived primarily from Greek mythology and other folklore, namely British and Scandinavian folklore.[1] Many of the legends surrounding these mythical creatures are also incorporated in the books. \"Children ... know that I didn't invent unicorns, but I've had to explain frequently that I didn't actually invent hippogriffs,\" Rowling told Stephen Fry in an interview for BBC Radio 4. \"When I do use a creature that I know is a mythological entity, I like to find out as much as I can about it. I might not use it, but to make it as consistent as I feel is good for my plot.\"[2]","image":"Gringotts_Dragon_(42428008435).jpg.webp"}
