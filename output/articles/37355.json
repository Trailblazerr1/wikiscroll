{"title":"Recurrence relation","summary":"In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation that expresses the nth term of a sequence as a function of the k preceding terms, for some fixed k (independent from n), which is called the order of the relation. Once k initial terms of a sequence are given, the recurrence relation allows computing recursively all terms of the sequence.","image":"b39e6366097c9c3c9fb8f9f1c4baaa3b927193b5.svg"}
