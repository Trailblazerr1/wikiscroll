{"title":"Ford Model T","summary":"The Ford Model T (colloquially known as the \"tin Lizzie,\" \"leaping Lena,\" \"jitney\" or \"flivver\") is an automobile produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927.[10][11] It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, which made car travel available to middle-class Americans. The relatively low price was partly the result of Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly line production instead of individual handcrafting.[12]","image":"1925_Ford_Model_T_touring.jpg.webp"}
