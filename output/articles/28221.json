{"title":"Management buyout","summary":"A management buyout (MBO) is a form of acquisition in which a company's existing managers acquire a large part, or all, of the company, whether from a parent company or non-artificial person(s). Management-, and/or leveraged buyout  became noted phenomena of 1980s business economics. These so-called MBOs originated in the US, spreading first to the UK and then throughout the rest of Europe. The venture capital industry has played a crucial role in the development of buyouts in Europe, especially in smaller deals in the UK, the Netherlands, and France.[1]","image":"Chicklet-currency.jpg.webp","url":"Management_buyout"}
