{"title":"pH meter","summary":"A pH meter is a scientific instrument that measures the hydrogen-ion activity in water-based solutions, indicating its acidity or alkalinity expressed as pH.[2] The pH meter measures the difference in electrical potential between a pH electrode and a reference electrode, and so the pH meter is sometimes referred to as a \"potentiometric pH meter\". The difference in electrical potential relates to the acidity or pH of the solution.[3]  The pH meter is used in many applications ranging from laboratory experimentation to quality control.[4]","image":"lossy-page1-220px-Beckman_Model_M_pH_Meter_2006.072.002.tif.jpg.webp"}
