{"title":"Pole position","summary":"In motorsports, the pole position is the position at the front at the start of a racing event. This position may be inside or outside of the front row, depending on where the racing line is on the particular circuit (the inside may not be advantageous if the vehicles usually run on the outside, due to debris and dust accumulating on the inside of the track), but it will always be ahead of the other vehicle(s) on the front row. This position is typically given to the vehicle and driver with the best qualifying time in the trials before the race (the leader in the starting grid). This number-one qualifying driver is referred to as the pole-sitter.","image":"Pole_position_markings_NÃ¼rburgring.jpg.webp"}
