{"title":"Nuckelavee","summary":"The nuckelavee ( /nʌklɑːˈviː/) or nuckalavee is a horse-like demon from Orcadian mythology that combines equine and human elements. It has its origins in Norse mythology, and British folklorist Katharine Briggs called it \"the nastiest\"[1] of all the demons of Scotland's Northern Isles. The nuckelavee's breath was thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and the creature was held responsible for droughts and epidemics on land despite being predominantly a sea-dweller.","image":"Douglas-Scottish_FFT(1901)-p162-Nuckalavee-illustr-J_Torrance_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Nuckelavee"}
