{"title":"George Frideric Handel","summary":"George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (/ˈhændəl/;[lower-alpha 1] baptised Georg Friederich Händel,[lower-alpha 2] German: [ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈhɛndl̩] (listen); 23 February 1685 – 14 April 1759[2][lower-alpha 3]) was a German-British Baroque composer well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concertos. Handel received his training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712, where he spent the bulk of his career and became a naturalised British subject in 1727.[4] He was strongly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and by composers of the Italian Baroque.","image":"George_Frideric_Handel_by_Balthasar_Denner.jpg.webp","url":"George_Frideric_Handel"}
