{"title":"Icon (computing)","summary":"In computing, an icon is a pictogram or ideogram displayed on a computer screen in order to help the user navigate a computer system. The icon itself is a quickly comprehensible symbol of a software tool, function, or a data file, accessible on the system and is more like a traffic sign than a detailed illustration of the actual entity it represents.[1] It can serve as an electronic hyperlink or file shortcut to access the program or data. The user can activate an icon using a mouse, pointer, finger, or recently voice commands. Their placement on the screen, also in relation to other icons, may provide further information to the user about their usage.[2] In activating an icon, the user can move directly into and out of the identified function without knowing anything further about the location or requirements of the file or code.","image":"Data-transfer.svg.png.webp"}
