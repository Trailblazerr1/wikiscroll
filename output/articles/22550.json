{"title":"Island of stability","summary":"In nuclear physics, the island of stability is a predicted set of isotopes of superheavy elements that may have considerably longer half-lives than known isotopes of these elements. It is predicted to appear as an \"island\" in the chart of nuclides, separated from known stable and long-lived primordial radionuclides. Its theoretical existence is attributed to stabilizing effects of predicted \"magic numbers\" of protons and neutrons in the superheavy mass region.[1][2]","image":"Island_of_Stability_derived_from_Zagrebaev.svg.png.webp","url":"Island_of_stability"}
