{"title":"Phage therapy","summary":"Phage therapy, viral phage therapy, or phagotherapy is the therapeutic use of bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infections.[1] Bacteriophages, known as phages, are a form of virus.[2] Phages attach to bacterial cells, and inject a viral genome into the cell.[3] The viral genome effectively replaces the bacterial genome, halting the bacterial infection.[3] The bacterial cell causing the infection is unable to reproduce, and instead produces additional phages.[2] Phages are very selective in the strains of bacteria they are effective against.[3] Advantages include reduced side-effects and reduced risk of the bacterium's developing resistance.[3] Disadvantages include the difficulty of finding an effective phage for a particular infection.[3] However, virulent phages can be isolated much more easily than other compounds and natural products.[4] In addition to this, development of standardized manufacturing processes would make lab to clinic delivery of phages much quicker.
