{"title":"Accretion (astrophysics)","summary":"In astrophysics, accretion is the accumulation of particles into a massive object by gravitationally attracting more matter, typically gaseous matter, in an accretion disk.[1][2] Most astronomical objects, such as galaxies, stars, and planets, are formed by accretion processes.","image":"HL_Tau_protoplanetary_disk.jpg.webp"}
