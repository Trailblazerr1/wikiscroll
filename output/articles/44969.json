He was again the Republican presidential nominee in 1948, but lost to President Harry S. Truman in one of the greatest upsets in presidential election history.[1] Dewey played a large role in winning the Republican presidential nomination for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952, helping  Eisenhower win the presidential election that year.[2] He also played a large part in the choice of Richard Nixon as the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956.[3]","image":"Thomas_E._Dewey_color_photograph.png.webp","url":"Thomas_E._Dewey"}
