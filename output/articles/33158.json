{"title":"Opioid receptor","summary":"Opioid receptors are a group of inhibitory G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands.[1][2][3] The endogenous opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Opioid receptors are distributed widely in the brain, in the spinal cord, on peripheral neurons, and digestive tract.","image":"4DJH_anim.2.gif","url":"Opioid_receptor"}
