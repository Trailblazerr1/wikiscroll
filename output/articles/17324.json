{"title":"Galaxy","summary":"A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally \"milky\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few hundred million (108) stars to giants with one hundred trillion (1014) stars,[3] each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.","image":"NGC_4414_(NASA-med).jpg.webp","url":"Galaxy"}
