{"title":"Cottage","summary":"A cottage, during England's feudal period, was the holding by a cottager (known as a cotter or bordar) of a small house with enough garden to feed a family and in return for the cottage, the cottager had to provide some form of service to the manorial lord.[2] However, in time cottage just became the general term for a small house. In modern usage, a cottage is usually a modest, often cosy dwelling, typically in a rural or semi-rural location and not necessarily in England. The cottage orné, often quite large and grand residences built by the nobility, dates back to a movement of \"rustic\" stylised cottages of the late 18th and early 19th century during the Romantic movement.","image":"Lahnavesi-Vihannanselkä-Miekankoski-IMG_6938.jpg.webp","url":"Cottage"}
