{"title":"Crème fraîche","summary":"Crème fraîche (English pronunciation: /ˌkrɛmˈfrɛʃ/, French pronunciation: [kʁɛm fʁɛʃ] (listen), lit. \"fresh cream\") is a dairy product, a soured cream containing 10–45% butterfat, with a pH of approximately 4.5.[1] It is soured with a bacterial culture. European labeling regulations specify the two ingredients must be cream and bacterial culture. It is served over fruit and baked goods, as well as being added to soups and sauces. It is used in a variety of other recipes. Sour cream is a similar foodstuff, except that crème fraîche is less sour and has a higher fat content. Sour cream may contain thickening agents not permitted in crème fraîche in many jurisdictions.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
