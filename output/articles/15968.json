{"title":"Female condom","summary":"A female condom (also known as a femidom or internal condom) is a barrier device that is used during sexual intercourse as a barrier contraceptive to reduce the probability of pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Meant as an alternative to the condom for males, it was invented by Danish MD Lasse Hessel and designed to be worn internally by the female partner during vaginal sex to prevent exposure to ejaculated semen or other body fluids. His invention was launched in Europe in 1990 and approved by the FDA for sale in the USA in 1993.[2] Its protection against STIs is inferior to that of male condoms.[3] Internal condoms can be used by the receptive partner during anal sex.[4][5]","image":"Préservatif_féminin.jpg.webp","url":"Female_condom"}
