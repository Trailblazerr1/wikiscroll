{"title":"Chili pepper","summary":"The chili pepper (also chile, chile pepper, chilli pepper, or chilli[3]), from Nahuatl chīlli (Nahuatl pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːlːi] (listen)), is the berry-fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum which are members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.[4] Chili peppers are widely used in many cuisines as a spice to add pungent 'heat' to dishes. Capsaicin and related compounds known as capsaicinoids are the substances giving chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically. Although this definition would technically include bell peppers, in common language they are often two discrete categories: bell peppers and chili peppers.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
