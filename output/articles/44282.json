{"title":"The Internationale","summary":"\"The Internationale\" (French: \"L'Internationale\", [l‿ɛ̃.tɛʁ.na.sjɔ.nal(ə)]) is a left-wing anthem. It has been a standard of the socialist movement since the late nineteenth century, when the Second International adopted it as its official anthem. The title arises from the \"First International\", an alliance of workers which held a congress in 1864. The author of the anthem's lyrics, Eugène Pottier, an anarchist, attended this congress.[1][2] In turn, the song was later set to an original melody composed by Pierre De Geyter, a Marxist.[3]","image":"L'Internationale.jpg.webp"}
