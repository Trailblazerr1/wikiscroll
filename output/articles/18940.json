{"title":"Greenpeace","summary":"Greenpeace is an independent global campaigning network. The network comprises 26 independent national/regional organisations in over 55 countries across Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, as well as a co-ordinating body, Greenpeace International, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.[3] Greenpeace was founded in 1971 by Irving Stowe and Dorothy Stowe, Canadian and US expat environmental activists. Greenpeace states its goal is to \"ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity\"[4] and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, research, and ecotage[5] to achieve its goals. The global network does not accept funding from governments, corporations, or political parties, relying on three million individual supporters and foundation grants.[6][7] Greenpeace has a general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council[8] and is a founding member[9] of the INGO Accountability Charter, an international non-governmental organization that intends to foster accountability and transparency of non-governmental organizations.","image":"Greenpeace_logo.svg.png.webp"}
