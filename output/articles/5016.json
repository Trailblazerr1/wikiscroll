{"title":"Autism spectrum","summary":"The autism spectrum is an umbrella term covering a range of neurodevelopmental conditions referred to as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The word spectrum is defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to cover a wider group of conditions and differences in the type and perceived severity of symptoms, a trend which developed in the 1980s;[1][2] an alternative term, autism spectrum conditions, has been used by some to avoid perceived negativity associated with the word disorder.[3][4] Asperger syndrome is included in the term autism spectrum disorder. The 11th International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), released in January 2021,[5] characterises ASD with deficits in the ability of an individual to begin and sustain two-way social communication and restricted or repetitive behavior unusual for the individual's age or situation (see Classification). Although linked with early childhood, the symptoms can appear later, frequently associated with increased social interaction. With considerable variation, also dependent on the context, deficits can cause impediments in personal, family, social, educational and occupational situations; those diagnosed with ASD range from the independent and gifted to the very challenged and needy requiring intervention and long-term support.[6][7][8][9]","image":"Autism-stacking-cans_2nd_edit.jpg.webp"}
