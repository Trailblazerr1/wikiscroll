{"title":"Cultural imperialism","summary":"Cultural imperialism, also called cultural colonialism, comprises the cultural aspects of imperialism. \"Imperialism\" here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between civilisations, favouring a more powerful civilisation. Thus cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture (usually that of a politically powerful country) over a less powerful society. This may take the form of cultural hegemony of industrialised or  politically and  economically influential countries influencing general cultural values and standardising (globalising) civilisations elsewhere.[1]","image":"Le_chasseur_de_jaguars_et_son_fils_Novis_Manioc.jpeg.webp"}
