{"title":"Money supply","summary":"In macroeconomics, the money supply (or money stock) refers to the total volume of money held by the public at a particular point in time in an economy. There are several ways to define \"money\", but standard measures usually include currency in circulation and demand deposits (depositors' easily accessed assets on the books of financial institutions).[1][2] The central bank of each country may use a definition of what constitutes money for its purposes.","image":"Bank_of_England_Facade.jpg.webp"}
