{"title":"Supermarket","summary":"A supermarket is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In everyday U.S. usage, however, \"grocery store\" is synonymous with supermarket,[1] and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries.[2][1]","image":"Lidl_and_Regional_road_559_in_Siilinj√§rvi.jpg.webp","url":"Supermarket"}
