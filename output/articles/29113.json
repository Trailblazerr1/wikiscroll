{"title":"Measure (mathematics)","summary":"Measure is a fundamental concept of mathematics. Measures provide a mathematical abstraction for common notions like mass, distance/length, area, volume, probability of events, and — after some adjustments — electrical charge. These seemingly distinct concepts are innately very similar and may, in many cases, be treated as mathematically indistinguishable. Measures are foundational in probability theory. Far-reaching generalizations of measure are widely used in quantum physics and physics in general.","image":"Measure_illustration_(Vector).svg.png.webp","url":"Measure_(mathematics)"}
