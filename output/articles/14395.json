{"title":"Electional astrology","summary":"Electional astrology, also known as event astrology, is a branch found in most traditions of astrology according to which a practitioner decides the most appropriate time for an event based on the astrological auspiciousness of that time.[1] It differs from horary astrology because, while horary astrologers seek to find the answer to a question based on the time the question was asked, electional astrologers seek to find a period of time which will result in the most preferable outcome for an event being planned.","image":"Astrological_Chart_-_New_Millennium.JPG.webp","url":"Electional_astrology"}
