{"title":"Proteolysis","summary":"Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or amino acids. Uncatalysed, the hydrolysis of peptide bonds is extremely slow, taking hundreds of years. Proteolysis is typically catalysed by cellular enzymes called proteases, but may also occur by intra-molecular digestion.","image":"Proteolysis_uncat.svg.png.webp","url":"Proteolysis"}
