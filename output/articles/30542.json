{"title":"Morpheme","summary":"A morpheme is the smallest meaningful lexical item in a language. A morpheme is not necessarily the same as a word. The main difference between a morpheme and a word is that a morpheme sometimes does not stand alone, but a word, by definition, always stands alone. The field of linguistic study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
