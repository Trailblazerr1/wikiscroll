{"title":"Geneva Bible","summary":"The Geneva Bible is one of the most historically significant translations of the Bible into English, preceding the King James Version by 51 years.[1]  It was the primary Bible of 16th-century English Protestantism and was used by William Shakespeare,[2] Oliver Cromwell, John Knox, John Donne, and John Bunyan, author of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).[3] It was one of the Bibles taken to America on the Mayflower. (Pilgrim Hall Museum has collected several Bibles of Mayflower passengers.) The Geneva Bible was used by many English Dissenters, and it was still respected by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers at the time of the English Civil War, in the booklet The Souldiers Pocket Bible.[4]","image":"GenevaBible.JPG.webp","url":"Geneva_Bible"}
