{"title":"Annealing (materials science)","summary":"In metallurgy and materials science, annealing is a heat treatment that alters the physical and sometimes chemical properties of a material to increase its ductility and reduce its hardness, making it more workable. It involves heating a material above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature for an appropriate amount of time and then cooling.","image":"FagerstaRAÃ„2.jpg.webp"}
