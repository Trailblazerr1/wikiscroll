{"title":"Equine anatomy","summary":"Equine anatomy refers to the gross and microscopic anatomy of horses, ponies and other equids, including donkeys, mules and zebras. While all anatomical features of equids are described in the same terms as for other animals by the International Committee on Veterinary Gross Anatomical Nomenclature in the book Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria, there are many horse-specific colloquial terms used by equestrians.","image":"Points_of_a_horse.jpg.webp","url":"Equine_anatomy"}
