{"title":"Social market economy","summary":"The social market economy (SOME; German: soziale Marktwirtschaft), also called Rhine capitalism, Rhine-Alpine capitalism, the Rhenish model, and social capitalism,[1] is a socioeconomic model combining a free-market capitalist economic system alongside social policies and enough regulation to establish both fair competition within the market and generally a welfare state.[2][3] It is sometimes classified as a coordinated market economy.[4] The social market economy was originally promoted and implemented in West Germany by the Christian Democratic Union under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer in 1949[5] and today it is used by Christian Democrats and Social Democrats alike. Its origins can be traced to the interwar Freiburg school of economic thought.[6]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Social_market_economy"}
