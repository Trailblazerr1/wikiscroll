{"title":"Fractal","summary":"In mathematics, a fractal is a subset of Euclidean space with a fractal dimension that strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Fractals appear the same at different scales, as illustrated in successive magnifications of the Mandelbrot set.[1][2][3][4] Fractals often exhibit similar patterns at increasingly smaller scales, a property called self-similarity, also known as expanding symmetry or unfolding symmetry; if this replication is exactly the same at every scale, as in the Menger sponge,[5] it is called affine self-similar.  Fractal geometry lies within the mathematical branch of measure theory.","image":"Mandel_zoom_00_mandelbrot_set.jpg.webp","url":"Fractal"}
