{"title":"Libra (astrology)","summary":"Libra (♎︎) is the seventh astrological sign in the zodiac. Libra is Latin for scales. It spans 180°–210° celestial longitude.[2] The Sun transits this sign on average between September 23 (September equinox) and October 23.[3][4] Under the sidereal zodiac, the Sun currently transits the constellation of Libra from approximately October 31 to November 22.[5] The symbol of the scales is based on the Scales of Justice held by Themis, the Greek personification of divine law and custom.[6] She became the inspiration for modern depictions of Lady Justice. The ruling planet of Libra is Venus.[7][8] Libra is the only zodiac sign that is represented by an object; with the other eleven signs represented by either an animal or mythological character.[9]","image":"Libra_symbol_(Moskowitz%2C_fixed_width).svg.png.webp"}
