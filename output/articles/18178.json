{"title":"Glanville fritillary","summary":"The Glanville Fritillary (Melitaea cinxia) is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae. It is named for the naturalist who discovered it and the checkerboard pattern on its wings. These butterflies live in almost all of Europe, especially Finland, and in parts of northwest Africa. They are absent from the far north of Europe and parts of the Iberian Peninsula. To the east they are found across the Palearctic (in Turkey, Russia, northern Kazakhstan and Mongolia).","image":"Melitaea_cinxia_(3722394380).jpg.webp","url":"Glanville_fritillary"}
