{"title":"Periodic function","summary":"A periodic function  is a function that repeats its values at regular intervals. For example, the trigonometric functions, which repeat at intervals of \n  \n    \n      \n        2\n        Ï€\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2\\pi }\n  \n radians, are periodic functions. Periodic functions are used throughout science to describe oscillations, waves, and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity. Any function that is not periodic is called aperiodic.","image":"73efd1f6493490b058097060a572606d2c550a06.svg"}
