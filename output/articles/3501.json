{"title":"Ancient Carthage","summary":"Ancient Carthage (/ˈkɑːrθɪdʒ/) was a city in modern Tunisia, and also the name given to the city-state and empire it eventually gained. The settlement was founded by the Phoenicians in the ninth century BC and the city-state was destroyed by the Romans in 146 BC, though they later rebuilt the city lavishly.[4][5][6] At its height in the fourth century BC, the city-state was one of the largest metropolises in the world,[7] and the centre of the Carthaginian Empire, a major power in the ancient world that dominated the western Mediterranean.","image":"Carthage_standard.svg.png.webp"}
