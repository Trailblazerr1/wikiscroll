{"title":"2020 Atlantic hurricane season","summary":"The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, and one of the costliest. The season also had the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) since 2017. In addition, it was the fifth consecutive above-average season from 2016 onward. The season featured a total of 31 tropical or subtropical cyclones, all but one of which became a named storm. Of the 30 named storms, 14 developed into hurricanes, and a record-tying seven further intensified into major hurricanes.[nb 1] It was the second and final season to use the Greek letter storm naming system, the first being 2005. Of the 30 named storms, 11 of them made landfall in the contiguous United States, breaking the record of nine set in 1916. During the season, 27 tropical storms established a new record for earliest formation date by storm number.[nb 2] This season also featured a record 10 tropical cyclones that underwent rapid intensification, tying it with 1995. This unprecedented activity was fueled by a La Niña that developed in the summer months of 2020. Despite the record-high activity, this was the first season since 2015 in which no Category 5 hurricane formed.[nb 3]","image":"2020_Atlantic_hurricane_season_summary_map.png.webp"}
