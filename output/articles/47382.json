{"title":"Video game","summary":"A video game[lower-alpha 1] or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. This feedback is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology. Computer games are not all video games—for example text adventure games, chess, and so on do not depend upon a graphics display.","image":"Pong_(28684491143).jpg.webp","url":"Video_game"}
