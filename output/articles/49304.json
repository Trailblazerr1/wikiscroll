{"title":"You Really Got Me","summary":"\"You Really Got Me\" is a song written by Ray Davies for English rock band the Kinks. The song, originally performed in a more blues-oriented style, was inspired by artists such as Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy. Two versions of the song were recorded, with the second performance being used for the final single. Although it was rumoured that future Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page had performed the song's guitar solo, the myth has since been proven false.","image":"You_Really_Got_Me_cover.jpg.webp","url":"You_Really_Got_Me"}
