{"title":"Mobile payment","summary":"Mobile payment (also referred to as mobile money, mobile money transfer, and mobile wallet) generally refer to payment services operated under financial regulation and performed from or via a mobile device. Instead of paying with cash, cheque, or credit cards, a consumer can use a mobile to pay for a wide range of services and digital or hard goods. Although the concept of using non-coin-based currency systems has a long history,[1] it is only in the 21st century that the technology to support such systems has become widely available.","image":"Shopping_cart_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Mobile_payment"}
