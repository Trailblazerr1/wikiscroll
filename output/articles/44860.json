{"title":"Theresienstadt Ghetto","summary":"Theresienstadt Ghetto was established by the SS during World War II in the fortress town of Terez√≠n, located in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (a German-occupied region of Czechoslovakia). Theresienstadt served two main purposes: it was simultaneously a waystation to the extermination camps, and a \"retirement settlement\" for elderly and prominent Jews to mislead their communities about the Final Solution. Its conditions were deliberately engineered to hasten the death of its prisoners, and the ghetto also served a propaganda role. Unlike other ghettos, the exploitation of forced labor was not economically significant.","image":"In_the_Living_Quarters.jpg.webp","url":"Theresienstadt_Ghetto"}
