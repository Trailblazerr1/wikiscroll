{"title":"Protagonist","summary":"A protagonist (from Ancient Greek: πρωταγωνιστής, romanized: prōtagōnistḗs, lit. 'one who plays the first part, chief actor')[1][2][3]  is the main character of a story. The protagonist makes key decisions that affect the plot, primarily influencing the story and propelling it forward and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.[4]","image":"Hamlet_William_Morris_Hunt.jpeg.webp"}
