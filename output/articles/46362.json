{"title":"U2 360° Tour","summary":"The U2 360° Tour was a worldwide concert tour by rock band U2.[1] Staged in support of the group's 2009 album No Line on the Horizon, the tour visited stadiums from 2009 through 2011. The concerts featured the band playing \"in the round\" on a circular stage, allowing the audience to surround them on all sides.[2] To accommodate the stage configuration, a large four-legged structure nicknamed \"The Claw\" was built above the stage, with the sound system and a cylindrical, expanding video screen on top of it. At 164 feet (50 m) tall, it was the largest stage ever constructed.[3] U2 claimed that the tour would be \"the first time a band has toured in stadiums with such a unique and original structure.\"[4]","image":"U2-360-tour-logo.png.webp","url":"U2_360°_Tour"}
