{"title":"Anisotropy","summary":"Anisotropy (/ˌæn.ə-, ˌæn.aɪˈsɒtr.əp.i/) is the property of a material which allows it to change or assume different properties in different directions as opposed to isotropy. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's physical or mechanical properties (absorbance, refractive index, conductivity, tensile strength, etc.)","image":"WMAP_2010.png.webp"}
