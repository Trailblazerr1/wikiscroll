{"title":"Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling","summary":"Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈjoːzɛf ˈʃɛlɪŋ];[13][14][15][16] 27 January 1775 – 20 August 1854), later (after 1812) von Schelling, was a German philosopher. Standard histories of philosophy make him the midpoint in the development of German idealism, situating him between Johann Gottlieb Fichte, his mentor in his early years, and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, his one-time university roommate, early friend, and later rival. Interpreting Schelling's philosophy is regarded as difficult because of its evolving nature.","image":"Nb_pinacoteca_stieler_friedrich_wilhelm_joseph_von_schelling.jpg.webp","url":"Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling"}
