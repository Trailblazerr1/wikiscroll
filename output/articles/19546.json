{"title":"Hanging","summary":"Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck.[1] The Oxford English Dictionary states that hanging in this sense is \"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \"hanging\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first known account of execution by hanging was in Homer's Odyssey (Book XXII).[2] In this specialised meaning of the common word hang, the past and past participle is hanged instead of hung.","image":"Pisanello_010.jpg.webp","url":"Hanging"}
