{"title":"Gluconeogenesis","summary":"Gluconeogenesis (GNG) is a metabolic pathway that results in the generation of glucose from certain non-carbohydrate carbon substrates. It is a ubiquitous process, present in plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and other microorganisms.[1] In vertebrates, gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in the cortex of the kidneys. It is one of two primary mechanisms â€“ the other being degradation of glycogen (glycogenolysis) - used by humans and many other animals to maintain blood sugar levels, avoiding low levels (hypoglycemia).[2] In ruminants, because dietary carbohydrates tend to be metabolized by rumen organisms, gluconeogenesis occurs regardless of fasting, low-carbohydrate diets, exercise, etc.[3]  In many other animals, the process occurs during periods of fasting, starvation, low-carbohydrate diets, or intense exercise.","image":"Gluconeogenesis.png.webp"}
