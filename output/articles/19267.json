{"title":"H. H. Holmes","summary":"Herman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 â€“ May 7, 1896), better known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes, was an American serial killer[1] active from December 1891 to November 1894. Despite his confession of  27 murders (including some people who were verifiably still alive) while awaiting execution,[2] Holmes was convicted and sentenced to death for only one murder, that of accomplice and business partner Benjamin Pitezel.[3] Victims were killed in a mixed-use building which he owned in Chicago, located about three miles (5 kilometers) west of the 1893 World's Fair: Columbian Exposition, supposedly called the World's Fair Hotel (informally called \"The Murder Castle\"), though evidence suggests the hotel portion was never truly open for business.[4]","image":"H._H._Holmes.jpg.webp"}
