{"title":"Flag of Guernsey","summary":"The flag of Guernsey was adopted in 1985 and consists of the red Saint George's Cross with an additional gold Norman cross within it. The creation was prompted by confusion at international sporting events over competitors from Guernsey and England using the same flag.[2] It was designed by the Guernsey Flag Investigation Committee led by Deputy Bailiff Sir Graham Dorey. The flag was first unveiled on the island on 15 February 1985.  The gold cross represents William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy (who became, after the conquest, William I of England).  William purportedly was given such a cross by Pope Alexander II and flew it on his standard in the Battle of Hastings.[3] Since 2000, a red ensign with the cross in the fly has been used as the government's civil ensign and as a blue ensign.","image":"Flag_of_Guernsey.svg.png.webp"}
