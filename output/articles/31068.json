{"title":"Māori people","summary":"The Māori (/ˈmaʊri/,[6] Māori: [ˈmaːɔɾi] (listen)) are the indigenous Polynesian people of mainland New Zealand (Aotearoa). Māori originated with settlers from East Polynesia, who arrived in New Zealand in [[Māori migration canoes|several waves of waka]] (canoe) voyages between roughly 1320 and 1350.[7] Over several centuries in isolation, these settlers developed their own distinctive culture, whose language, mythology, crafts, and performing arts evolved independently from those of other eastern Polynesian cultures. Some early Māori moved to the Chatham Islands where their descendants became New Zealand's other indigenous Polynesian ethnic group, the Moriori.[8]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
