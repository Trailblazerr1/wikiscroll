{"title":"The Clash","summary":"The Clash were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 who were key players in the original wave of British punk rock. Billed as \"The Only Band That Matters\", they also contributed to the post-punk and new wave movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed elements of a variety of genres including reggae, dub, funk, ska, and rockabilly. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Joe Strummer, lead guitarist and vocalist Mick Jones, bassist Paul Simonon, and drummer Nicky \"Topper\" Headon. Headon left the group in 1982 due to internal friction surrounding his increasing heroin addiction and it was more internal friction which led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.","image":"Clash_21051980_12_800.jpg.webp"}
