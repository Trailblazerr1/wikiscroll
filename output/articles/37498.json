The region is centered on a historical region of the same name in what is now southeastern Spain. It is heir to the ancient Kingdom of Murcia, which traditionally included, as a bi-provincial region,[6] the provinces of Albacete and Murcia.[7] During the transition to democracy (la Transición), Albacete became part of Castilla–La Mancha. The region is 11,313 km2 (4,368 sq mi) in area and had a population of 1,511,251 as at the start of 2020.[8] About one-third of its population lives in the capital, Murcia.
