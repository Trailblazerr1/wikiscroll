{"title":"Oxymoron","summary":"An oxymoron (usual plural oxymorons, more rarely oxymora) is a figure of speech that juxtaposes concepts with opposing meanings within a word or phrase that creates an ostensible self-contradiction. An oxymoron can be used as a rhetorical device to illustrate a rhetorical point or to reveal a paradox.[1][2]\nA more general meaning of \"contradiction in terms\" (not necessarily for rhetoric effect) is recorded by the OED for 1902.[3]","image":"Oxymoron_(PSF).png.webp"}
