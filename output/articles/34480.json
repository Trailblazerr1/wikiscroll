{"title":"Peripatric speciation","summary":"Peripatric speciation is a mode of speciation in which a new species is formed from an isolated peripheral population.[1]: 105  Since peripatric speciation resembles allopatric speciation, in that populations are isolated and prevented from exchanging genes, it can often be difficult to distinguish between them.[2] Nevertheless, the primary characteristic of peripatric speciation proposes that one of the populations is much smaller than the other. The terms peripatric and peripatry are often used in biogeography, referring to organisms whose ranges are closely adjacent but do not overlap, being separated where these organisms do not occur—for example on an oceanic island compared to the mainland. Such organisms are usually closely related (e.g. sister species); their distribution being the result of peripatric speciation.","image":"Peripatric_Speciation_Schematic.svg.png.webp","url":"Peripatric_speciation"}
