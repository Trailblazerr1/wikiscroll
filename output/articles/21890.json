{"title":"Indo-Fijians","summary":"Indo-Fijians or Indian-Fijians (also known as Fiji Indians) are Fijian citizens of fully or partially South Asian descent, including descendants who trace their heritage from various regions of the Indian subcontinent.[7] Although Indo-Fijians constituted a majority of Fiji's population from 1956 through the late 1980s, discrimination and the resulting brain drain resulted in them numbering 313,798 (37.6%) (2007 census) out of a total of 827,900 people living in Fiji as of 2007.[8] The term Indo-Fijians refers to the Indian subcontinent, not only modern day India, formally the Republic of India.","image":"Flag_of_Fiji.svg.png.webp","url":"Indo-Fijians"}
