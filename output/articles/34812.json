{"title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society","summary":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society is a scientific journal published by the Royal Society. In its earliest days, it was a private venture of the Royal Society's secretary.[1][2] It was established in 1665,[3] making it the first journal in the world exclusively devoted to science,[2] and therefore also the world's longest-running scientific journal.[2] It became an official society publication in 1752.[4] The use of the word philosophical in the title refers to natural philosophy, which was the equivalent of what would now be generally called science.","image":"Philosophical_Transactions_Volume_1_frontispiece.jpg.webp"}
