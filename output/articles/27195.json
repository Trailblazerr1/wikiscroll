{"title":"Lockheed P-38 Lightning","summary":"The Lockheed P-38 Lightning is an American single-seated, twin piston-engined fighter aircraft that was used during World War II. Developed for the United States Army Air Corps, the P-38 had distinctive twin booms and a central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. Allied propaganda claimed it had been nicknamed the fork-tailed devil (German: der Gabelschwanz-Teufel) by the Luftwaffe and \"two planes, one pilot\" by the Japanese.[4] Along with its use as a general fighter, the P-38 was used in various aerial combat roles, including as a highly effective fighter-bomber, a night fighter, and as a long-range escort fighter when equipped with drop tanks.[5] The P-38 was also used as a bomber-pathfinder, guiding streams of medium and heavy bombers; or even other P-38s, equipped with bombs, to their targets.[6] Used in the aerial reconnaissance role, the P-38 accounted for 90% of the aerial film captured over Europe.[7]","image":"P38_Lightning.jpg.webp","url":"Lockheed_P-38_Lightning"}
