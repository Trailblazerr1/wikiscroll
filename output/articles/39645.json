{"title":"Science in classical antiquity","summary":"Science in classical antiquity encompasses inquiries into the workings of the world or universe aimed at both practical goals (e.g., establishing a reliable calendar or determining how to cure a variety of illnesses) as well as more abstract investigations belonging to natural philosophy. The ancient peoples who are considered today as the first scientists may have thought of themselves as natural philosophers, as practitioners of a skilled profession (for example, physicians), or as followers of a religious tradition (for example, temple healers). Some of these figures include Hippocrates, Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes, Hipparchus, Galen, and Ptolemy. Their works and commentaries spread throughout the Eastern, Islamic, and Latin worlds and became the wellspring of science.","image":"Ptolemaic-geocentric-model.jpg.webp","url":"Science_in_classical_antiquity"}
