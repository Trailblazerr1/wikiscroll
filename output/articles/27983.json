{"title":"Magic realism","summary":"Magic realism (also known as magical realism or marvelous realism) is a 20th-century style of fiction and literary genre. The terms were influenced by an eponymous German painting style in the 1920s.[1] As a literary fiction style, magic realism paints a realistic view of the modern world while also adding magical elements, often dealing with the blurring of the lines between fantasy and reality.[2] Magical realism, perhaps the most common term, often refers to literature in particular, with magical or supernatural phenomena presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting, commonly found in novels and dramatic performances.[1]: 1–5  Despite including certain magic elements, it is generally considered to be a different genre from fantasy because magical realism uses a substantial amount of realistic detail and employs magical elements to make a point about reality, while fantasy stories are often separated from reality.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]  Magical realism is often seen as an amalgamation of real and magical elements that produces a more inclusive writing form than either literary realism or fantasy.[4]","image":"Alejocarpentier.jpg.webp","url":"Magic_realism"}
