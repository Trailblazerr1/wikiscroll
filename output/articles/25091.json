{"title":"Kronosaurus","summary":"Kronosaurus (/ˌkrɒnoʊˈsɔːrəs/ KRON-o-SAWR-əs; meaning \"lizard of Kronos\") is an extinct genus of short-necked pliosaur. With an estimated length of 9 to 10.9 meters (30 to 36 ft), it was among the largest pliosaurs, and is named after the leader of the Greek Titans, Kronos. It lived in the Early Cretaceous period (Aptian to Late Albian).[2][3] Fossil material has been recovered from the Toolebuc Formation (middle to late Albian) and Wallumbilla Formations (Aptian) of Queensland and New South Wales in Australia, and from the upper Paja Formation (late Aptian) in Boyacá, Colombia, and assigned to two species.","image":"Kronosaurus_boyacensis_fossil.jpg.webp","url":"Kronosaurus"}
