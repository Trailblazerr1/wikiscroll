{"title":"Meridian (geography)","summary":"In geography and geodesy, a meridian (or line of longitude) is the half of an imaginary polar great circle or great ellipse on the Earth's surface, a coordinate line terminated by the North Pole and the South Pole. A meridian is the locus connecting points of equal longitude, which is the angle (in degrees or other units) east or west of a given prime meridian (currently, the IERS Reference Meridian).[1] The position of a point along the meridian is given by that longitude and its latitude, measured in angular degrees north or south of the Equator. Each meridian is perpendicular to all circles of latitude. Meridians are half of a great circle on the Earth's surface. The length of a meridian on a modern ellipsoid model of the earth (WGS 84) has been estimated at 20,003.93Â km (12,429.9 miles).[2]","image":"Primemeridian.jpg.webp"}
