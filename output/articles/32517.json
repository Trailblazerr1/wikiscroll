{"title":"Nucleic acid double helix","summary":"In molecular biology, the term double helix[1] refers to the structure formed by double-stranded molecules of nucleic acids such as DNA. The double helical structure of a nucleic acid complex arises as a consequence of its secondary structure, and is a fundamental component in determining its tertiary structure. The term entered popular culture with the publication in 1968 of The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA by James Watson.","image":"DNA_orbit_animated_static_thumb.png.webp","url":"Nucleic_acid_double_helix"}
