{"title":"Architecture of the medieval cathedrals of England","summary":"The medieval cathedrals of England, which date from between approximately 1040 and 1540, are a group of twenty-six buildings that constitute a major aspect of the country’s artistic heritage and are among the most significant material symbols of Christianity. Though diverse in style, they are united by a common function. As cathedrals, each of these buildings serves as central church for an administrative region (or diocese) and houses the throne of a bishop (Late Latin ecclēsia cathedrālis, from the Greek, καθέδρα).[1] Each cathedral also serves as a regional centre and a focus of regional pride and affection.[2]","image":"Fullingmill.jpg.webp","url":"Architecture_of_the_medieval_cathedrals_of_England"}
