{"title":"Al-Kateb v Godwin","summary":"Al-Kateb v Godwin,[2] was a decision of the High Court of Australia, which ruled on 6 August 2004 that the indefinite detention of a stateless person was lawful. The case concerned Ahmed Al-Kateb, a Palestinian man born in Kuwait, who moved to Australia in 2000 and applied for a temporary protection visa. The Commonwealth Minister for Immigration's decision to refuse the application was upheld by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Court. In 2002, Al-Kateb declared that he wished to return to Kuwait or Gaza.[3] However, since no country would accept Al-Kateb, he was declared stateless and detained under the policy of mandatory detention.","image":"Coat_of_Arms_of_Australia.svg.png.webp"}
