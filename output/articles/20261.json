{"title":"Hibiscus syriacus","summary":"Hibiscus syriacus is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to south-central and southeast China, but widely introduced elsewhere, including much of Asia.[3] It was given the epithet syriacus because it had been collected from gardens in Syria.[4][5][6] Common names include the rose of Sharon,[7] (especially in North America), Syrian ketmia,[8] shrub althea,[9] and rose mallow (in the United Kingdom). It is the national flower of South Korea and is mentioned in the South Korean national anthem.[10]","image":"Hibiscus_Syriacus.JPG.webp","url":"Hibiscus_syriacus"}
