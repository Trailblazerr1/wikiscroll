{"title":"Bree (Middle-earth)","summary":"Bree is a fictional village, with the land around it, in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, east of the Shire, and the only place where Hobbits and Men lived side by side. It was inspired by the Buckinghamshire village of Brill, which Tolkien visited regularly in his early years at Oxford,[1][2] and his passion for linguistics.[3]","image":"Brill_village_from_Brill_Common_-_geograph.org.uk_-_538330.jpg.webp"}
