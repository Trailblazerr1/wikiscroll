{"title":"Suicide","summary":"Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death.[9] Mental disorders (including depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, personality disorders, anxiety disorders), nihilistic beliefs, physical disorders (such as chronic fatigue syndrome) and substance use disorders (including alcohol use disorder and the use of and withdrawal from benzodiazepines) are risk factors.[2][3][5][10] Some suicides are impulsive acts due to stress (such as from financial or academic difficulties), relationship problems (such as breakups), or harassment/bullying.[2][11][12] Those who have previously attempted suicide are at a higher risk for future attempts.[2] Effective suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide—such as firearms, drugs, and poisons; treating mental disorders and substance misuse; careful media reporting about suicide; and improving economic conditions.[2][13] Even though crisis hotlines are common, they have not been well studied.[14][15]","image":"Édouard_Manet_-_Le_Suicidé_(ca._1877).jpg.webp","url":"Suicide"}
