{"title":"Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world","summary":"Islamic astronomy comprises the astronomical developments made in the Islamic world, particularly during the Islamic Golden Age (9thâ€“13th centuries),[1] and mostly written in the Arabic language. These developments mostly took place in the Middle East, Central Asia, Al-Andalus, and North Africa, and later in the Far East and India. It closely parallels the genesis of other Islamic sciences in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science with Islamic characteristics. These included Greek, Sassanid, and Indian works in particular, which were translated and built upon.[2]","image":"Astrolabe-Persian-18C.jpg.webp","url":"Astronomy_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world"}
