{"title":"Yonge Street","summary":"Yonge Street (/jʌŋ/; \"young\") is a major arterial route in the Canadian province of Ontario connecting the shores of Lake Ontario in Toronto to Lake Simcoe, a gateway to the Upper Great Lakes. Until 1999, the Guinness Book of World Records repeated the popular misconception it was 1,896 km (1,178 mi)[4] long, making it the longest street in the world; this was due to a conflation of Yonge Street with the rest of Ontario's Highway 11. Yonge Street (including the Bradford-to-Barrie extension) is only 86 kilometres (53 mi) long.[1][3]","image":"Town_of_North_Toronto_Sign.jpg.webp","url":"Yonge_Street"}
