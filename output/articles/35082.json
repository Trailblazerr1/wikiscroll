{"title":"Pisco","summary":"Pisco is a colorless or yellowish-to-amber colored brandy produced in winemaking regions of Peru[1] and Chile.[2] Made by distilling fermented grape juice into a high-proof spirit, it was developed by 16th-century Spanish settlers as an alternative to orujo, a pomace brandy that was being imported from Spain.[3]  It had the advantages of being produced from abundant domestically grown fruit and reducing the volume of alcoholic beverages transported to remote locations.[4]","image":"Piscos.JPG.webp","url":"Pisco"}
