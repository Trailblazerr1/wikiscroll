{"title":"Last.fm","summary":"Last.fm is a music website founded in the United Kingdom in 2002. Using a music recommender system called \"Audioscrobbler\", Last.fm builds a detailed profile of each user's musical taste by recording details of the tracks the user listens to, either from Internet radio stations, or the user's computer or many portable music devices. This information is transferred (\"scrobbled\") to Last.fm's database either via the music player (including, among others, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal, MusicBee, and Anghami) or via a plug-in installed into the user's music player. The data is then displayed on the user's profile page and compiled to create reference pages for individual artists.","image":"Lastfm_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Last.fm"}
