{"title":"Circle","summary":"A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number (Circle with \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r=0}\n  \n is a degenerated case). This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.","image":"894a83e863728b4ee2e12f3a999a09f5f2bf1c89.svg"}
