{"title":"Phan Đình Phùng","summary":"Phan Đình Phùng (Vietnamese: [faːn ɗîŋ̟ fûŋm]; 1847 – January 21, 1896) was a Vietnamese revolutionary who led rebel armies against French colonial forces in Vietnam. He was the most prominent of the Confucian court scholars involved in anti-French military campaigns in the 19th century and was cited after his death by 20th-century nationalists as a national hero. He was renowned for his uncompromising will and principles—on one occasion,[1] he refused to surrender even after the French had desecrated his ancestral tombs and had arrested and threatened to kill his family.","image":"Statue_of_Phan_Dinh_Phung_2_crop.JPG.webp"}
