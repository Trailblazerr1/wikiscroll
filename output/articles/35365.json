{"title":"Police ranks of the United Kingdom","summary":"Most of the police forces of the United Kingdom use a standardised set of ranks, with a slight variation in the most senior ranks for the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police.[1][2] Most of the British police ranks that exist today were chosen by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel, the founder of the Metropolitan Police, enacted under the Metropolitan Police Act 1829. The ranks at that time were deliberately chosen so that they did not correspond with military ranking (with the exception of sergeant), because of fears of a paramilitary force.","image":"Chief_Constable.svg.png.webp","url":"Police_ranks_of_the_United_Kingdom"}
