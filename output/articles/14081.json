{"title":"Ecdysis","summary":"Ecdysis is the moulting of the cuticle in many invertebrates of the clade Ecdysozoa. Since the cuticle of these animals typically forms a largely inelastic exoskeleton, it is shed during growth and a new, larger covering is formed.[1] The remnants of the old, empty exoskeleton are called exuviae.[2]","image":"Rhopalomyia_solidaginis_eclosion.jpg.webp","url":"Ecdysis"}
