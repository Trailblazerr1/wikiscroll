{"title":"Minnie Mouse","summary":"Minnie Mouse is a cartoon character created by The Walt Disney Company. As the longtime sweetheart of Mickey Mouse, she is an anthropomorphic mouse with white gloves, a bow, polka-dotted dress, and low-heeled shoes occasionally with ribbons on them. The Mickey Mouse comic strip story \"The Gleam\" (published January 19 â€“ May 2, 1942) by Merrill De Maris and Floyd Gottfredson first gave her full name as Minerva Mouse, although this is seldom used.","image":"Minnie_Mouse_Duckipedia.png.webp","url":"Minnie_Mouse"}
