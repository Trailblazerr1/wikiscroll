{"title":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder","summary":"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) is an etiologically heterogeneous syndrome predominantly characterized by acute inflammation of the optic nerve (optic neuritis, ON) and the spinal cord (myelitis).[1][2] Episodes of ON and myelitis can be simultaneous or successive. A relapsing disease course is common, especially in untreated patients.[1][3] In more than 80% of cases, NMO is caused by immunoglobulin G autoantibodies to aquaporin 4 (anti-AQP4), the most abundant water channel protein in the central nervous system. A subset of anti-AQP4-negative cases is associated with antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (anti-MOG).[1][3] Rarely, NMO may occur in the context of other autoimmune diseases (e.g. connective tissue disorders, paraneoplastic syndromes) or infectious diseases. In some cases, the etiology remains unknown (idiopathic NMO).","image":"Glial_Cell_Types.png.webp","url":"Neuromyelitis_optica_spectrum_disorder"}
