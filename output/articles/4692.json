{"title":"Assistant referee (association football)","summary":"In association football, an assistant referee (also known as a linesman or lineswoman) is an official empowered with assisting the referee in enforcing the Laws of the Game during a match. Although assistants are not required under the Laws, at most organised levels of football the match officiating crew consists of the referee and at least two assistant referees. The responsibilities of the various assistant referees are listed in Law 6, \"The Other Match Officials\". In the current Laws the term \"assistant referee\" technically refers only to the two officials who generally patrol the touchlines, with the wider range of assistants to the referee given other titles.","image":"Clemens_Schüttengruber%2C_Fußballschiedsrichter_(03).jpg.webp","url":"Assistant_referee_(association_football)"}
