{"title":"Sewage","summary":"Sewage (or domestic sewage, domestic wastewater, municipal wastewater) is a type of wastewater that is produced by a community of people. It is typically transported through a sewer system.[1]: 175  Sewage consists of wastewater discharged from residences and from commercial, institutional and public facilities that exist in the locality.[2]: 10  Sub-types of sewage are greywater (from sinks, bathtubs, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers) and blackwater (the water used to flush toilets, combined with the human waste that it flushes away). Sewage also contains soaps and detergents. Food waste may be present from dishwashing, and food quantities may be increased where garbage disposal units are used. In regions where toilet paper is used rather than bidets, that paper is also added to the sewage. Sewage contains macro-pollutants and micro-pollutants, and may also incorporate some municipal solid waste and pollutants from industrial wastewater.","image":"Influent_raw_wastewater_(note_grey_colour_in_glass_jar)_(3232393634).jpg.webp","url":"Sewage"}
