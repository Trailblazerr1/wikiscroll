{"title":"South Dakota-class battleship (1939)","summary":"The South Dakota class was a group of four fast battleships built by the United States Navy. They were the second class of battleships to be named after the 40th state; the first were designed in the 1920s and canceled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Four ships comprised the class: South Dakota, Indiana, Massachusetts, and Alabama. They were designed to the same treaty standard displacement limit of 35,000 long tons (35,600Â t) as the preceding  North Carolina class and had the same main battery of nine 16\"/45 caliber Mark 6 guns in three-gun turrets, but were more compact and better protected. The ships can be visually distinguished from the earlier vessels by their single funnel, compared to twin funnels in the North Carolinas. According to naval historians William Garzke and Robert Dulin, the South Dakota design was the best \"treaty battleship\" ever built.[1]","image":"USS_Alabama_(BB-60)_in_Casco_Bay_c1942.jpg.webp","url":"South_Dakota-class_battleship_(1939)"}
