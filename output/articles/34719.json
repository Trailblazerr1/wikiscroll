{"title":"Phenethylamine","summary":"Phenethylamine[note 1] (PEA) is an organic compound, natural monoamine alkaloid, and trace amine, which acts as a central nervous system stimulant in humans. In the brain, phenethylamine regulates monoamine neurotransmission by binding to trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and inhibiting vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) in monoamine neurons.[1][12][13] To a lesser extent, it also acts as a neurotransmitter in the human central nervous system.[14] In mammals, phenethylamine is produced from the amino acid L-phenylalanine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase via enzymatic decarboxylation.[15] In addition to its presence in mammals, phenethylamine is found in many other organisms and foods, such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation.","image":"Phenethylamine2DCSD.svg.png.webp","url":"Phenethylamine"}
