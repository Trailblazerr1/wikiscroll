{"title":"Atlantis","summary":"Atlantis (Ancient Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος, Atlantis nesos, \"island of Atlas\") is a fictional island mentioned in an allegory on the hubris of nations in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias, wherein it represents the antagonist naval power that besieges \"Ancient Athens\", the pseudo-historic embodiment of Plato's ideal state in The Republic.[1] In the story, Athens repels the Atlantean attack unlike any other nation of the known world,[2] supposedly bearing witness to the superiority of Plato's concept of a state.[3][4] The story concludes with Atlantis falling out of favor with the deities and submerging into the Atlantic Ocean.","image":"Atlantis_Kircher_Mundus_subterraneus_1678.jpg.webp"}
