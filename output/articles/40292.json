{"title":"Shape of the universe","summary":"The shape of the universe, in physical cosmology, is the local and global geometry of the universe. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its curvature, whereas the topology of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. \nThe spatial curvature is related to general relativity, which describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy. The spatial topology cannot be determined from its curvature, due to the fact that there exist (mathematically) locally indistinguishable spaces with different topologies.[1]","image":"Planck_satellite_cmb.jpg.webp"}
