{"title":"Nobby Stiles","summary":"Norbert Peter Stiles MBE (18 May 1942 – 30 October 2020)[2] was an English footballer and manager. He played for England for five years, winning 28 caps and scoring one goal. He played every minute of England's victorious 1966 FIFA World Cup campaign. In the semi-final of that tournament against Portugal, he was given the job of marking the prolific Eusébio. His tough performance resulted in Eusébio being practically nullified for the entire game. Stiles also played in the final, which England won 4–2 against West Germany. His post-match dance on the Wembley pitch, holding the World Cup trophy in one hand and his false teeth in the other, was widely broadcast.","image":"Nobby_Stiles_(1966).jpg.webp","url":"Nobby_Stiles"}
