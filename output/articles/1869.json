{"title":"Abbasid Caliphate","summary":"The Abbasid Caliphate (/əˈbæsɪd/ or /ˈæbəsɪd/ Arabic: اَلْخِلَافَةُ ٱلْعَبَّاسِيَّةُ‎, al-Khilāfah al-ʿAbbāsīyah) was the third caliphate to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name.[2] They ruled as caliphs for most of the caliphate from their capital in Baghdad in modern-day Iraq, after having overthrown the Umayyad Caliphate in the Abbasid Revolution of 750 CE (132 AH). The Abbasid Caliphate first centered its government in Kufa, modern-day Iraq, but in 762 the caliph Al-Mansur founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient Sasanian capital city of Ctesiphon. Baghdad became a center of science, culture, philosophy and invention in what became known as the Golden Age of Islam.","image":"Abbasid_banner.svg.png.webp","url":"Abbasid_Caliphate"}
