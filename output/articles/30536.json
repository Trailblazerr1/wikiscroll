{"title":"Mormonism and Nicene Christianity","summary":"Mormonism and Nicene Christianity (often called mainstream Christianity)[1] have a complex theological, historical, and sociological relationship. Mormons express their doctrines using standard biblical terminology and have similar views about the nature of Jesus Christ's atonement, bodily resurrection, and Second Coming as traditional Christianity. Nevertheless, most Mormons do not accept the Trinitarian doctrine of Nicene Christianity, codified in the Nicene and Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creeds of 325 and 381.[2] Although Mormons consider the Protestant Bible as scripture, they do not believe in biblical inerrancy. They have also adopted additional scriptures that they believe to have been divinely revealed to Joseph Smith,[3][4][5] including the Book of Mormon,[3][4][5] the Doctrine and Covenants,[3] and the Pearl of Great Price.[3] Mormons practice baptism and celebrate the sacrament, but they also participate in other religious rituals. Mormons self-identify as Christians.[6]","image":"Joseph_Smith_first_vision_stained_glass.jpg.webp","url":"Mormonism_and_Nicene_Christianity"}
