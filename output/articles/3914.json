{"title":"Anti-Defamation League","summary":"The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), formerly known as the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, is an international Jewish non-governmental organization based in the United States. It was founded in late September 1913 by the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, in the wake of the contentious conviction for murder of Leo Frank. ADL subsequently split from B'nai B'rith and continued as an independent US section 501(c)(3) nonprofit. ADL states that its mission is twofold: \"To stop the defamation of the Jewish people, and to secure justice and fair treatment to all,\" via the development of \"new programs, policies and skills to expose and combat whatever holds us back.\"[3] With a focus on combating antisemitism and other forms of hate, and fighting domestic extremism both online and off, ADL describes its \"ultimate goal\" as \"a world in which no group or individual suffers from bias, discrimination or hate.\"[4] In 2018, ADL rebranded as an \"anti-hate\" organization, adopting the motto \"Fighting Hate for Good\".[5]","image":"ADL_logo_(2018)_cropped.svg.png.webp","url":"Anti-Defamation_League"}
