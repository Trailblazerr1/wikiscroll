{"title":"Pogrom","summary":"A pogrom is a violent riot incited with the aim of massacring or expelling an ethnic or religious group, particularly Jews.[1] The Slavic term originally entered the English language as a descriptive term for 19th- and 20th-century attacks on Jews which occurred in the Russian Empire (mostly within the Pale of Settlement). Similar attacks against Jews which also occurred at other times and places retrospectively became known as pogroms.[2] Sometimes the word is used to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish ethnic or religious groups. The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incident, at times leading to, or culminating in, massacres.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]","image":"Pluenderung_der_Judengasse_1614.png.webp","url":"Pogrom"}
