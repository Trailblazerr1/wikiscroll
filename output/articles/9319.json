{"title":"Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor","summary":"Charles IV (Czech: Karel IV.; German: Karl IV.; Latin: Carolus IV; 14 May 1316 (22 May Greg.) – 29 November 1378[1]), also known as Charles of Luxembourg, born Wenceslaus (Czech: Václav),[2] was the first King of Bohemia to become Holy Roman Emperor. He was a member of the House of Luxembourg from his father's side and the Czech House of Přemyslid from his mother's side; he emphasized the latter due to his lifelong affinity for the Czech side of his inheritance, and also because his direct ancestors in the Přemyslid line included two saints.[3][4]","image":"Charles_IV-John_Ocko_votive_picture-fragment.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor"}
