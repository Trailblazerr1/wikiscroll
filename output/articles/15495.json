{"title":"Exergy","summary":"In thermodynamics, the exergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir, reaching maximum entropy. When the surroundings are the reservoir, exergy is the potential of a system to cause a change as it achieves equilibrium with its environment.  Exergy is the energy that is available to be used. After the system and surroundings reach equilibrium, the exergy is zero.  Determining exergy was also the first goal of thermodynamics. The term \"exergy\" was coined in 1956 by Zoran Rant (1904â€“1972) by using the Greek ex and ergon meaning \"from work\"[1][3], but the concept had been earlier developed by J Willard Gibbs in 1873 (Gibbs free energy).[4]","image":"e991473bc2c861672c7a7408bbe242130abd07a4.svg","url":"Exergy"}
