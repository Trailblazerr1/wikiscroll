{"title":"Arthur Phillip","summary":"Admiral Arthur Phillip (11 October 1738 – 31 August 1814) was a Royal Navy officer who became the founding governor of the Colony of New South Wales. After a lengthy maritime career, Phillip was appointed by Lord Sydney to the position of commander of the First Fleet, a fleet of 11 ships whose crew were to establish a penal colony and a settlement at Botany Bay, New South Wales. On arriving at Botany Bay, Phillip found the site unsuitable and searched for a more habitable site for a settlement, which he found in Port Jackson – the site of Sydney, Australia, today.","image":"Arthur_Phillip_-_Wheatley_ML124.jpg.webp","url":"Arthur_Phillip"}
