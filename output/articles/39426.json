{"title":"Sarcomere","summary":"A sarcomere (Greek σάρξ sarx \"flesh\", μέρος meros \"part\") is the smallest functional unit of striated muscle tissue.[1] It is the repeating unit between two Z-lines. Skeletal muscles are composed of tubular muscle cells (called muscle fibers or myofibers) which are formed during  embryonic myogenesis. Muscle fibers contain numerous tubular myofibrils. Myofibrils are composed of repeating sections of sarcomeres, which appear under the microscope as alternating dark and light bands. Sarcomeres are composed of long, fibrous proteins as filaments that slide past each other when a muscle contracts or relaxes. The costamere is a different component that connects the sarcomere to the sarcolemma.","image":"Sarcomere.gif"}
