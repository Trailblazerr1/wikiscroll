{"title":"Real-time strategy","summary":"Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games that do not progress incrementally in turns,[1] but allow all players to play simultaneously, in \"real time\".  By contrast, in turn-based strategy (TBS) games, players take turns to play. The term \"real-time strategy\" was coined by Brett Sperry to market Dune II in the early 1990s.[2][3]","image":"Video-Game-Controller-Icon-IDV-green-strategy.svg.png.webp"}
