{"title":"First Australian Imperial Force","summary":"The First Australian Imperial Force (1st AIF) was the main expeditionary force of the Australian Army during World War I. It was formed as the Australian Imperial Force (the AIF) on 15 August 1914, following Britain's declaration of war on Germany, initially with a strength of one infantry division and one light horse brigade. The infantry division subsequently fought at Gallipoli between April and December 1915, being reinforced by a second division which was later raised, as well as three light horse brigades. After being evacuated to Egypt the AIF was expanded to five infantry divisions, which were committed to the fighting in France and Belgium along the Western Front in March 1916. A sixth infantry division was partially raised in 1917 in the United Kingdom, but was broken up and used as reinforcements following heavy casualties on the Western Front. Meanwhile, two mounted divisions remained in the Middle East to fight against Turkish forces in the Sinai and Palestine.","image":"AWM_E00019_5th_Div_1916.jpg.webp","url":"First_Australian_Imperial_Force"}
