{"title":"Great Oxidation Event","summary":"The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), also called Great Oxygenation Event, was a time interval when the Earth's atmosphere and the shallow ocean first experienced a rise in the amount of oxygen. This occurred approximately 2.4–2.0 Ga (billion years ago), during the Paleoproterozoic era.[2] Geological,  isotopic, and chemical evidence suggests that  biologically-produced molecular oxygen (dioxygen, O2) started to accumulate in Earth's atmosphere and changed it from a weakly reducing atmosphere practically free of oxygen into an oxidizing atmosphere containing abundant oxygen,[3] causing many existing anaerobic species on Earth to die out.[4] The event is inferred to have been caused by cyanobacteria producing the oxygen, which stored enough chemical energy[5] to enable the subsequent development of multicellular life-forms.[6]","image":"Oxygenation-atm-2.svg.png.webp"}
