{"title":"Penalty kick (association football)","summary":"A penalty kick (commonly known as a penalty or a pen., also called a spot kick) is a method of restarting play in association football, in which a player is allowed to take a single shot on the goal while it is defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper. It is awarded when a offence punishable by a direct free kick is committed by a player in their own penalty area. The shot is taken from the penalty mark, which is 11 m (12 yards) from the goal line and centred between the touch lines.","image":"Chicago_Fire_v._Club_América_2013_38.jpg.webp"}
