{"title":"Weather","summary":"Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere,[2][3] just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, \"weather\" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.","image":"Thunder_lightning_Garajau_Madeira_289985700.jpg.webp","url":"Weather"}
