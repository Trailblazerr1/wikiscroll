{"title":"Garbage (album)","summary":"Garbage is the debut studio album by American rock band Garbage. It was released on August 15, 1995, by Almo Sounds. The album was met with critical acclaim upon its release, being viewed by some as an innovative recording for its time. It reached number 20 on the US Billboard 200 and number six on the UK Albums Chart, while charting inside the top 20 and receiving multi-platinum certifications in several territories. The album's success was helped by the band promoting it on a year-long tour, including playing on the European festival circuit and supporting the Smashing Pumpkins throughout 1996, as well as by a run of increasingly successful singles culminating with \"Stupid Girl\", which received Grammy Award nominations for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group in 1997.","image":"GarbageSTinternational.png.webp","url":"Garbage_(album)"}
