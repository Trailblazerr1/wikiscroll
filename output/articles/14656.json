{"title":"Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008","summary":"The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, often called the \"bank bailout of 2008\", was proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, passed by the 110th United States Congress, and signed into law by President George W. Bush. The act became law as part of Public Law 110-343 on October 3, 2008, in the midst of the financial crisis of 2007â€“2008. The law created the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to purchase toxic assets from banks. The funds for purchase of distressed assets were mostly redirected to inject capital into banks and other financial institutions while the Treasury continued to examine the usefulness of targeted asset purchases.[1][2]","image":"Ustreasur.JPG.webp"}
