{"title":"Radha","summary":"Radha (Sanskrit: राधा, IAST: Rādhā), also called Radhika, is a Hindu goddess and a chief consort of the god Krishna. She is worshiped as the goddess of love, tenderness, compassion and devotion. She is the avatar of Lakshmi [2] and is also described as the chief of gopis (milkmaids). During Krishna's youth, she appears as his lover and companion, though he is not married to her.[3][2] In contrast, some traditions and scriptures accord Radha the status of the eternal consort and wife of Krishna.[4][2][5] Radha, as a supreme goddess, is considered as the female counterpart and the internal potency (hladini shakti) of Krishna, who resides in Goloka, the celestial abode of Radha Krishna.[6] Radha is said to accompany Krishna in all his incarnations.[4]","image":"Radharani_10.JPG.webp"}
