{"title":"Anarcho-communism","summary":"Anarcho-communism,[1][2][3][4] also known as anarchist communism,[lower-alpha 1] is a political philosophy and anarchist school of thought which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labour, social hierarchies[17] and private property (while retaining respect for personal property, along with collectively-owned items, goods and services)[18] in favor of common ownership of the means of production[19][20] and direct democracy as well as a horizontal network of workers' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\".[21][22] Some forms of anarcho-communism such as insurrectionary anarchism are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism to be the best social system for the realization of individual freedom.[23][24][25][26] Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.[27][28][29][30][31]","image":"Rb-star.svg.png.webp"}
