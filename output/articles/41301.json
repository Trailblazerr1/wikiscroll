{"title":"Solution (chemistry)","summary":"In chemistry, a solution is a special type of homogeneous mixture composed of two or more substances. In such a mixture, a solute is a substance dissolved in another substance, known as a solvent. The mixing process of a solution happens at a scale where the effects of chemical polarity are involved, resulting in interactions that are specific to solvation. The solution usually has the state of the solvent when the solvent is the larger fraction of the mixture, as is commonly the case. One important parameter of a solution is the concentration, which is a measure of the amount of solute in a given amount of solution or solvent. The term \"aqueous solution\" is used when one of the solvents is water.[1]","image":"SaltInWaterSolutionLiquid.jpg.webp","url":"Solution_(chemistry)"}
