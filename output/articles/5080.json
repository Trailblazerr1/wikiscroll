{"title":"Avatar (computing)","summary":"In computing, an avatar is a graphical representation of a user or the user's character or persona. It may take either a two-dimensional form as an icon in Internet forums and other online communities[1][2] (where it is also known as a profile picture or userpic) or a three-dimensional form,[3] as in games or virtual worlds. Avatar images have also been referred to as \"picons\" (personal icons)[4] in the past, though the usage of this term is uncommon now. An avatar can also refer to a text construct found on early systems such as MUDs.[5] The term \"avatar\" can also refer to the personality connected with the screen name, or handle, of an Internet user.[6]","image":"Jo_Kay_-_Those_Green_Eyes_(1431777290).jpg.webp","url":"Avatar_(computing)"}
