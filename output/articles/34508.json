{"title":"Perpetual virginity of Mary","summary":"The perpetual virginity of Mary is one of the four Marian dogmas of the Catholic Church,[2] and states that Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a virgin ante partum, in partu, et post partumâ€”before, during and after the birth of Christ.[3] In Western Christianity, some Lutheran and Anglican theologians adhere to the doctrine;[4][5][6] Eastern Orthodox churches recognize Mary as Aeiparthenos, meaning \"ever-virgin\".[Notes 1][7] Modern Protestants have largely rejected the doctrine.[8]","image":"Vladimirskaya.jpg.webp"}
