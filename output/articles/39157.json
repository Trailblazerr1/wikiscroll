{"title":"Salvia divinorum","summary":"Salvia divinorum  (Latin: \"sage of the diviners\"; also called ska mar√≠a pastora, seer's sage, yerba de la pastora or simply salvia) is a plant species with transient psychoactive properties when its leaves are consumed by chewing, smoking, or as a tea.[2] The leaves contain opioid-like compounds that induce hallucinations.[3] Because the plant has not been well-studied in high-quality clinical research, little is known about its toxicology, adverse effects, or safety over long-term consumption.[2][3]\n\nIts native habitat is cloud forest in the isolated Sierra Mazateca of Oaxaca, Mexico, where it grows in shady, moist locations.[4][5] The plant grows to over a meter high,[1] has hollow square stems like others in the mint family Lamiaceae, large leaves, and occasional white flowers with violet calyxes. Botanists have not determined whether Salvia divinorum is a cultigen or a hybrid because native plants reproduce vegetatively and rarely produce viable seed.[6][7]","image":"Salvia_divinorum_-_Herba_de_Maria.jpg.webp"}
