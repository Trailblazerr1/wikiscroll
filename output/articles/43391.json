{"title":"Tantra","summary":"Tantra (/ˈtæntrə/; Sanskrit: तन्त्र, lit. 'loom, weave, warp') are the esoteric traditions of Hinduism and Buddhism that developed in India from the middle of the 1st millennium CE onwards.[1] The term tantra, in the Indian traditions, also means any systematic broadly applicable \"text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique or practice\".[2][3] A key feature of these traditions is the use of mantras, and thus they are commonly referred to as Mantramārga (\"Path of Mantra\") in Hinduism or Mantrayāna (\"Mantra Vehicle\") and Guhyamantra (\"Secret Mantra\") in Buddhism.[4][5]","image":"Vajrayogini_from_Thangka.jpg.webp"}
