{"title":"Ghrelin","summary":"Ghrelin /ˈɡrɛlɪn/ (or lenomorelin, INN) is a hormone produced by enteroendocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract, especially the stomach,[5][6] and is often called a \"hunger hormone\" because it increases food intake.[6] Blood levels of ghrelin are highest before meals when hungry, returning to lower levels after mealtimes.[6][7] Ghrelin may help prepare for food intake[6][8] by increasing gastric motility and gastric acid secretion.[6]","image":"Ideogram_human_chromosome_3.svg.png.webp"}
