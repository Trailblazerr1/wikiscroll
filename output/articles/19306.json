{"title":"HMS Lion (1910)","summary":"HMS Lion was a battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s. She was the lead ship of her class, which were nicknamed the \"Splendid Cats\".[1] They were significant improvements over their predecessors of the  Indefatigable class in terms of speed, armament and armour. This was in response to the first German battlecruisers, the  Moltke class, which were very much larger and more powerful than the first British battlecruisers, the  Invincible class.","image":"LionSP_001672.jpg.webp","url":"HMS_Lion_(1910)"}
