{"title":"Lindow Man","summary":"Lindow Man, also known as LindowÂ II and (in jest) as Pete Marsh, is the preserved bog body of a man discovered in a peat bog at Lindow Moss near Wilmslow in Cheshire, North West England. The remains were found on 1 August 1984 by commercial peat cutters. Lindow Man is not the only bog body to have been found in the moss; Lindow Woman was discovered the year before, and other body parts have also been recovered.[1] The find was described as \"one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 1980s\" [2] and caused a media sensation. It helped invigorate study of British bog bodies, which had previously been neglected.","image":"Lindow_Man_1.jpg.webp"}
