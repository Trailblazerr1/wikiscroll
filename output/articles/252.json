{"title":"1985 World Snooker Championship final","summary":"The 1985 World Snooker Championship final, also known as the black ball final, was played on the weekend of 27–28 April 1985 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. The final of the 1985 World Snooker Championship was between defending world champion Steve Davis and 1979 runner-up Dennis Taylor. It was Davis's fourth appearance in a final and Taylor's second. The best-of-35-frame match was split into four sessions. Davis won every frame in the first session to lead 7–0 but only led 9–7 and 13–11 after the second and third sessions. Until the final frame, Taylor was never ahead in frames but he tied the match three times at 11–11, 15–15 and 17–17. The deciding frame culminated over several shots on the final black ball. After both players failed to pot the ball several times, Taylor potted it to win his only world championship. Media outlets reported this as a major shock - Davis had been widely predicted to win the match having won three of the previous four world championships.","image":"Wiki_stevedavis_upload.jpg.webp"}
