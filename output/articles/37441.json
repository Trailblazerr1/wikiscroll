{"title":"Redox","summary":"Redox (reduction–oxidation, pronunciation: /ˈrɛdɒks/ RED-oks or /ˈriːdɒks/ REE-doks[2]) is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Redox reactions are characterized by the actual or formal transfer of electrons between chemical species, most often with one species (the reducing agent) undergoing oxidation (losing electrons) while another species (the oxidizing agent) undergoes reduction (gains electrons).[3] The chemical species from which the electron is removed is said to have been oxidized, while the chemical species to which the electron is added is said to have been reduced.
