{"title":"Proto-Indo-European root","summary":"The roots of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) are basic parts of words that carry a lexical meaning, so-called morphemes. PIE roots usually have verbal meaning like \"to eat\" or \"to run\". Roots never occurred alone in the language. Complete inflected verbs, nouns, and adjectives were formed by adding further morphemes to a root and potentially changing the root's vowel in a process called ablaut.","image":"d8511a4f9946db89d2f896b09fc5df711c318d58.svg"}
