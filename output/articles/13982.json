{"title":"Ease of doing business index","summary":"The ease of doing business index was an index created jointly by Simeon Djankov, Michael Klein, and Caralee McLiesh, three leading economists at the World Bank Group.[1][2][3] The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Edward Glaeser, Oliver Hart, and Andrei Shleifer.[4][5] Higher rankings (a low numerical value) indicated better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights. Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong.[6]  Though the first report was authored by Djankov, Klein, and McLiesh, and they continue to be listed as \"founders\" of the report,[1][2] some sources attribute the genesis of the idea to Djankov and Gerhard Pohl.[5][7] The report was discontinued by the World Bank on September 16, 2021, following the release of an independent audit of the data irregularities. The audit documented how bank leadership pressured experts to manipulate the results of the 2018 and 2020 Doing Business Reports.[8][9][10]","image":"Ease_of_Doing_Business_2020_in_colour.png.webp"}
