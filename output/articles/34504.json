{"title":"Permittivity","summary":"In electromagnetism, the absolute permittivity, often simply called permittivity and denoted by the Greek letter Îµ (epsilon), is a measure of the electric polarizability of a dielectric. A material with high permittivity polarizes more in response to an applied electric field than a material with low permittivity, thereby storing more energy in the material. In electrostatics, the permittivity plays an important role in determining the capacitance of a capacitor.","image":"Diel.png.webp"}
