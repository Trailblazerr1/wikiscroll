{"title":"Symeon the New Theologian","summary":"Symeon the New Theologian (Greek: Συμεὼν ὁ Νέος Θεολόγος; 949–1022) was a Byzantine Christian monk and poet who was the last of three saints canonized by the Eastern Orthodox church and given the title of \"Theologian\" (along with John the Apostle and Gregory of Nazianzus). \"Theologian\" was not applied to Symeon in the modern academic sense of theological study; the title was designed only to recognize someone who spoke from personal experience of the vision of God. One of his principal teachings was that humans could and should experience theoria (literally \"contemplation,\" or direct experience of God).","image":"Simeon_novyj.jpg.webp"}
