{"title":"Spanish missions in California","summary":"The Spanish missions in California (Spanish: Misiones espa√±olas en California) comprise a series of 21 religious outposts or missions established between 1769 and 1833 in what is now the U.S. state of California. Founded by Catholic priests of the Franciscan order to evangelize the Native Americans, the missions led to the creation of the New Spain province of Alta California and were part of the expansion of the Spanish Empire into the most northern and western parts of Spanish North America.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp","url":"Spanish_missions_in_California"}
