{"title":"Escape velocity","summary":"In celestial mechanics, escape velocity or escape speed is the minimum speed needed for a free, non-propelled object to escape from the gravitational influence of a primary body, thus reaching an infinite distance from it.  It is typically stated as an ideal speed, ignoring atmospheric friction.  Although the term \"escape velocity\" is common, it is more accurately described as a speed than a velocity because it is independent of direction; the escape speed increases with the mass of the primary body and decreases with the distance from the primary body. The escape speed thus depends on how far the object has already traveled, and its calculation at a given distance takes into account the fact that without new acceleration it will slow down as it travels—due to the massive body's gravity—but it will never quite slow to a stop.","image":"Angular_Parameters_of_Elliptical_Orbit.png.webp"}
