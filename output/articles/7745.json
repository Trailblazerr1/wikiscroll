{"title":"Bruce Nuclear Generating Station","summary":"Bruce Nuclear Generating Station is a nuclear power station located on the eastern shore of Lake Huron in Ontario, Canada.  It occupies 932 ha (2300 acres) of land.[2] The facility derives its name from Bruce Township,[3] the local municipality when the plant was constructed, now Kincardine due to amalgamation. With eight CANDU pressurized heavy-water reactors, it was the world's largest fully operational nuclear generating station by total reactor count and the number of currently operational reactors until 2016, when it was exceeded in nameplate capacity by South Korea's Kori Nuclear Power Plant. The station is the largest employer in Bruce County, with over 4000 workers.[4]","image":"Bruce-Nuclear-Szmurlo.jpg.webp","url":"Bruce_Nuclear_Generating_Station"}
