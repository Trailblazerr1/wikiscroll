{"title":"Salchow jump","summary":"The Salchow jump is an edge jump in figure skating. It was named after its inventor, Ulrich Salchow, in 1909.  The Salchow is accomplished with a takeoff from the back inside edge of one foot and a landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot.  It is \"usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple\".[1]  Timing is critical because both the takeoff and landing must be on the backward edge.  A Salchow is deemed cheated if the skate blade starts to turn forward before the takeoff, or if it has not turned completely backward when the skater lands back on the ice.[1]","image":"1908_Olympic_Games_Ulrich_Salchow.jpg.webp"}
