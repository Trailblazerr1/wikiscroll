{"title":"Arts and entertainment in India","summary":"Arts and entertainment in India  have had their course shaped by a synthesis of indigenous and foreign influences that have consequently shaped the course of the arts of the rest of Asia,  since ancient times.  Arts refer to paintings, architecture, literature, music, dance, languages and cinema. In early India, most of the arts were derived Vedic influences. After the birth of contemporary Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism arts flourished under the patronage of kings and emperors. The coming of Islam spawned a whole new era of Indian architecture and art. Finally the British brought their own Gothic and Roman influences and fused it with the Indian style. They have a culture infusion in their art.","image":"Taj_Mahal%2C_Agra%2C_India.jpg.webp","url":"Arts_and_entertainment_in_India"}
