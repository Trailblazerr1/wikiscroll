{"title":"COBOL","summary":"COBOL (/ˈkoʊbɒl, -bɔːl/; an acronym for \"common business-oriented language\") is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. However, due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages.[8] Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications; however, many large financial institutions were still developing new systems in COBOL as late as 2006.[9]","image":"page1-220px-COBOL_Report_Apr60.djvu.jpg.webp","url":"COBOL"}
