{"title":"Pinch hitter","summary":"In baseball, a pinch hitter is a substitute batter. Batters can be substituted at any time while the ball is dead (not in active play); the manager may use any player who has not yet entered the game as a substitute. Unlike basketball, American football or ice hockey, and in a similar way to association football, baseball does not have a \"free substitution rule\" (at the professional level) and thus the replaced player in baseball is not allowed back into that game. The pinch hitter assumes the spot in the batting order of the player whom he replaces.","image":"1988_Nashville_Lenny_Harris.jpg.webp","url":"Pinch_hitter"}
