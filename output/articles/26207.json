{"title":"Limonene","summary":"Limonene is a colorless liquid aliphatic hydrocarbon classified as a cyclic monoterpene, and is the major component in the oil of citrus fruit peels.[1] The D-isomer, occurring more commonly in nature as the fragrance of oranges, is a flavoring agent in food manufacturing.[1][2] It is also used in chemical synthesis as a precursor to carvone and as a renewables-based solvent in cleaning products.[1] The less common L-isomer has a piny, turpentine-like odor, and is found in the edible parts of such plants as caraway, dill, and bergamot orange plants.[3]","image":"Limonene-2D-skeletal.svg.png.webp","url":"Limonene"}
