{"title":"Viridiplantae","summary":"Viridiplantae (literally \"green plants\")[5] are a clade of eukaryotic organisms that comprise approximately 450,000â€“500,000 species and play important roles in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.[6] They are made up of the green algae, which are primarily aquatic, and the land plants (embryophytes), which emerged from within them.[7][8][9] Green algae traditionally excludes the land plants, rendering them a paraphyletic group. Since the realization that the embryophytes emerged from within the green algae, some authors are starting to include them.[10][11][12][13][14] They have cells with cellulose in their cell walls, and primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria that contain chlorophylls a and b and lack phycobilins.","image":"Taiwan_2009_East_Coast_ShihTiPing_Giant_Stone_Steps_Algae_FRD_6581.jpg.webp","url":"Viridiplantae"}
