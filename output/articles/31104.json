{"title":"NBA Sportsmanship Award","summary":"The NBA Sportsmanship Award is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given to a player who most \"exemplifies the ideals of sportsmanship on the court with ethical behavior, fair play, and integrity.\"[1] It is directly analogous to the Kim Perrot Sportsmanship Award, which has been awarded by the NBA's sister league, the WNBA, with neither award demanding excellence of play.","image":"Mike_Conley%2C_Jr_2.jpg.webp"}
