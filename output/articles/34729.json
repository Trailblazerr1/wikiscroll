{"title":"Phenotype","summary":"In genetics, the phenotype (from Greek  φαινο- (faino-) 'showing', and  τύπος (túpos) 'type') is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism.[1][2] The term covers the organism's  morphology or physical form and structure, its  developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the  expression of an organism's genetic code, or its genotype, and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called  polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is  Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown.  Richard Dawkins in 1978[3] and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as  caddis-fly larva cases and beaver dams as \"extended phenotypes\".","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
