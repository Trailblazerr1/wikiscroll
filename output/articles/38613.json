{"title":"Royal Banner of Scotland","summary":"The Royal Banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland,[1] also known as the Royal Banner of Scotland,[2][3] or more commonly the Lion Rampant of Scotland,[4] and historically as the Royal Standard of Scotland, (Scottish Gaelic: Bratach r√¨oghail na h-Alba, Scots: Ryal banner o Scotland) or Banner of the King of Scots,[5] is the Royal Banner of Scotland, and historically, the Royal Standard of the Kingdom of Scotland.[6] Used historically by the Scottish monarchs, the banner differs from Scotland's national flag, the Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent the Monarchy in Scotland.[6] It is also used in an official capacity at royal residences in Scotland when the Head of State is not present.[7]","image":"Royal_Banner_of_Scotland.svg.png.webp"}
