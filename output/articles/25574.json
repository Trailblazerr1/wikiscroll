{"title":"Late Heavy Bombardment","summary":"The Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB), or lunar cataclysm, is a hypothesized event thought to have occurred approximately 4.1 to 3.8 billion years (Ga) ago,[1] at a time corresponding to the Neohadean and Eoarchean eras on Earth. According to the hypothesis, during this interval, a disproportionately large number of asteroids collided with the early terrestrial planets in the inner Solar System, including Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.[2] These came from both post-accretion and planetary instability-driven populations of impactors.[3] Although generally accepted,[4] it remains difficult to prove conclusively.[5]","image":"Lunar_cataclysm.jpg.webp"}
