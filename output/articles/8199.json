{"title":"Calais","summary":"Calais (UK: /ˈkæleɪ/ KAL-ay, US: /kæˈleɪ/ kal-AY,[3][4] traditionally /ˈkælɪs/ KAL-iss, French: [kalɛ] (listen); Picard: Calés; West Flemish: Kales) is a city and major ferry port in Northern France in the Pas-de-Calais department, of which it is a subprefecture. Although Calais is by far the largest city in Pas-de-Calais, the department's prefecture is its third-largest city of Arras. The population of the city proper is 73,911; that of the urban area is 128,931 (2017).[5] Calais overlooks the Strait of Dover, the narrowest point in the English Channel, which is only 34 km (21 mi) wide here, and is the closest French town to England.  The White Cliffs of Dover can easily be seen on a clear day from Calais.  Calais is a major port for ferries between France and England, and since 1994, the Channel Tunnel has linked nearby Coquelles to Folkestone by rail.","image":"Zone_portuaire_calais_phare.jpg.webp","url":"Calais"}
