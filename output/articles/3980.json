{"title":"Antiseptic","summary":"An antiseptic (from Greek ἀντί anti, \"against\"[1] and σηπτικός sēptikos, \"putrefactive\"[2]) is an antimicrobial substance or compound that is applied to living tissue/skin to reduce the possibility of infection, sepsis, or putrefaction. Antiseptics are generally distinguished from antibiotics by the latter's ability to safely destroy bacteria within the body, and from disinfectants, which destroy microorganisms found on non-living objects.[3]","image":"Joseph_Lister.jpg.webp","url":"Antiseptic"}
