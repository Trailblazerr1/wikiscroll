{"title":"Emmer","summary":"Emmer wheat or hulled wheat[3] is a type of awned wheat.  Emmer is a tetraploid (4n = 4x = 28 chromosomes).[4]  The domesticated types are Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum and Triticum turgidum conv. durum. The wild plant is called Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides.  The principal difference between the wild and the domestic is that the ripened seed head of the wild plant shatters and scatters the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain.[5]","image":"Usdaemmer1.jpg.webp","url":"Emmer"}
