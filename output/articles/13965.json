{"title":"Earth's orbit","summary":"Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 149.60 million km (92.96 million mi)[1] in a counterclockwise pattern viewed above the northern hemisphere. One complete orbit takes 365.256 days (1 sidereal year), during which time Earth has traveled 940 million km (584 million mi).[2] Ignoring the influence of other Solar System bodies, Earth's orbit is an ellipse with the Earth-Sun barycenter as one focus and a current eccentricity of 0.0167. Since this value is close to zero, the center of the orbit is relatively close to the center of the Sun (relative to the size of the orbit).","image":"North_season.jpg.webp"}
