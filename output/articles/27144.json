{"title":"Living wage","summary":"A living wage is defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs.[3] This is not the same as a subsistence wage, which refers to a biological minimum. Needs are defined to include food, housing, and other essential needs such as clothing. The goal of a living wage is to allow a worker to afford a basic but decent standard of living through employment without government subsidies.[4] Due to the flexible nature of the term \"needs\", there is not one universally accepted measure of what a living wage is and as such it varies by location and household type.[5] A related concept is that of a family wage â€“ one sufficient to not only support oneself, but also to raise a family.","image":"Cost_of_Basic_but_Decent_Living.jpg.webp"}
