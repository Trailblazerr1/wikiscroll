{"title":"Samuel Bellamy","summary":"Captain Samuel Bellamy (c. February 23, 1689 â€“ April 26, 1717), later known as \"Black Sam\" Bellamy, was an English pirate who operated in the early 18th century. He is best known as the wealthiest pirate in recorded history, and one of the faces of the Golden Age of Piracy. Though his known career as a pirate captain lasted little more than a year, he and his crew captured at least 53 ships.[3] Called \"Black Sam\" in Cape Cod folklore because he eschewed the fashionable powdered wig in favor of tying back his long black hair with a simple band, Bellamy became known for his mercy and generosity toward those he captured on his raids. This reputation earned him another nickname, the \"Prince of Pirates\".  He likened himself to Robin Hood, with his crew calling themselves \"Robin Hood's Men\".[4][5]","image":"Pirate_Flag_of_Samuel_Bellamy.svg.png.webp"}
