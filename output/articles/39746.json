{"title":"Screening (medicine)","summary":"Screening, in medicine, is a strategy used to look for as-yet-unrecognised conditions or risk markers.[1][2][3] This testing can be applied to individuals or to a whole population. The people tested may not exhibit any signs or symptoms of a disease, or they might exhibit only one or two symptoms, which by themselves do not indicate a definitive diagnosis.","image":"Colorado_Coal_Miner_waiting_on_black_lung_screening_(9256404966).jpg.webp","url":"Screening_(medicine)"}
