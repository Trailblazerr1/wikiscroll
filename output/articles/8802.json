{"title":"Cashmere wool","summary":"Cashmere wool, usually simply known as cashmere, is a fiber obtained from  cashmere goats, pashmina goats, and some other breeds of goat. It has been used to make yarn, textiles and clothing for hundreds of years. Cashmere is closely associated with the Kashmir shawl, the word \"cashmere\" deriving from an anglicisation of Kashmir,  when the Kashmir shawl reached Europe in the 19th century. Both the soft undercoat and the guard hairs may be used; the softer hair is reserved for textiles, while the coarse guard hair is used for brushes and other non-apparel purposes.","image":"Kaschmirschal_1.jpg.webp","url":"Cashmere_wool"}
