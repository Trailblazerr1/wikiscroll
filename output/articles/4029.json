{"title":"Anwar al-Awlaki","summary":"Anwar Nasser al-Awlaki (also spelled al-Aulaqi, al-Awlaqi; Arabic: أنور العولقي‎, romanized: Anwar al-‘Awlaqī; April 21 or 22, 1971 – September 30, 2011) was a Yemeni-American imam who was killed in 2011 in Yemen by an American drone strike ordered by President Barack Obama. Al-Awlaki became the first U.S. citizen to be targeted and killed by a U.S. drone strike without the rights of due process being afforded.[7][8] US government officials argued that Awlaki was a key organizer for the Islamist terrorist group al-Qaeda, and in June 2014, a previously classified memorandum issued by the U.S. Department of Justice was released, justifying al-Awlaki's death as a lawful act of war.[9] Civil liberties advocates have described the incident as \"an extrajudicial execution\" that breached al-Awlaki's right to due process, including a trial.[10]","image":"Anwar_al-Awlaki_sitting_on_couch%2C_lightened.jpg.webp"}
