{"title":"Caribbean Community","summary":"The Caribbean Community (CARICOM or CC) is an intergovernmental organisation of 15 member states (14 nation-states and one dependency) throughout the Caribbean having primary objectives to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and to coordinate foreign policy.[10] The organisation was established in 1973. Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market); and handling regional trade disputes. The secretariat headquarters is in Georgetown, Guyana. CARICOM is an official United Nations Observer beneficiary.[11]","image":"Flag_of_CARICOM.svg.png.webp","url":"Caribbean_Community"}
