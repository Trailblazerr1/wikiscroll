{"title":"Sámi people","summary":"The Sámi people (/ˈsɑːmi/ SAH-mee; also spelled Sami or Saami) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric-speaking people inhabiting  the region of Sápmi (formerly known as Lapland), which today encompasses large northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and of the Murmansk Oblast, Russia, most of the Kola Peninsula in particular. The Sámi have historically been known in English as Lapps or Laplanders, but these terms are regarded as offensive by some Sámi people, who prefer the area's name in their own languages, e.g. Northern Sami Sápmi.[8][9] Their traditional languages are the Sámi languages, which are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.","image":"Sami_flag.svg.png.webp"}
