{"title":"Slavery in Africa","summary":"Slavery has historically been widespread in Africa. Systems of servitude and slavery were common in parts of Africa in ancient times, as they were in much of the rest of the ancient world.[1]  When the trans-Saharan slave trade, Indian Ocean slave trade and Atlantic slave trade (which started in the 16th century)[2] began, many of the pre-existing local African slave systems began supplying captives for slave markets outside Africa.[3][4]  Slavery in contemporary Africa is still practised despite its being illegal.","image":"African_slave_trade.png.webp"}
