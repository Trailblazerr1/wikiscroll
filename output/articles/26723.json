{"title":"List of World Series of Poker Main Event champions","summary":"The following is the list of World Series of Poker Main Event champions. The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is \"the oldest, largest, most prestigious, and most media-hyped gaming competition in the world\".[1]  It is held annually since 1970 in Las Vegas.  Since 1972, the Main Event of the WSOP has been the $10,000 buy-in no-limit Texas Hold 'Em tournament. The winner of the WSOP Main Event receives a World Series of Poker bracelet, millions of dollars (with the exact amount based on the number of entrants), and the right to be considered the year's World Champion of Poker.[2]  From 2008 to 2016, the nine players who made it to the final table of the Main Event were called the November Nine, a reference to the fact that the final table was completed in November, months after the Main Event's preliminary rounds were completed.","image":"JoeCada.jpg.webp"}
