{"title":"Snell's law","summary":"Snell's law (also known as Snellâ€“Descartes law  and the law of refraction) is a  formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction, when referring to light or other waves passing through a boundary between two different isotropic media, such as water, glass, or air. The law is named for Willebrord Snellius, a Dutch astronomer and mathematician, known in the English world as Snell.","image":"Snells_law2.svg.png.webp","url":"Snell's_law"}
