{"title":"History of ancient Israel and Judah","summary":"The Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah were two related Israelite kingdoms from the Iron Age period of the ancient Southern Levant. After an emergent and large polity was suddenly formed based on the Gibeon-Gibeah plateau and destroyed by Shoshenq I in the first half of 10th century BCE,[1] a return to small city-states was prevalent in the Southern Levant, but between 950 and 900 BCE another large polity emerged in the northern highlands with its capital eventually at  Tirzah, that can be considered the precursor of the Kingdom of Israel. [2] The Kingdom was consolidated as an important regional power by the first half of the 9th century BCE,[3] before falling to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 722Â BCE.","image":"Kingdoms_of_Israel_and_Judah_map_830.svg.png.webp"}
