{"title":"Lightning rod","summary":"A lightning rod (US, AUS, CA) or lightning conductor (UK) is a metal rod  mounted on a structure and intended to protect the structure from a lightning strike. If lightning hits the structure, it will preferentially strike the rod and be conducted to ground through a wire, instead of passing through the structure, where it could start a fire or cause electrocution. Lightning rods are also called finials, air terminals, or strike termination devices.","image":"Lightning-rod-diagram.svg.png.webp"}
