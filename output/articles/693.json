It started after the law intending to allow the 2017 Catalan independence referendum was denounced by the Spanish government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and subsequently suspended by the Constitutional Court until it ruled on the issue.[9][10] Some international media outlets have described the events as \"one of the worst political crises in modern Spanish history\".[11]","image":"E.U-Catalonia.png.webp","url":"2017–2018_Spanish_constitutional_crisis"}
