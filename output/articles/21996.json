{"title":"Inguinal hernia","summary":"An inguinal hernia is a protrusion of abdominal-cavity contents through the inguinal canal.[1] Symptoms are absent in about a third of patients.[1] This may include pain or discomfort especially with or following coughing, exercise, or bowel movements.[1] Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down.[1] A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when bearing down.[1] Inguinal hernias occur more often on the right than left side.[1] The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the intestine is blocked.[1] This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area.[1]","image":"Inguinalhernia.gif"}
