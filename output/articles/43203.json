{"title":"T. Rex (band)","summary":"T. Rex were  an English rock band, formed in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Marc Bolan. The band was initially called Tyrannosaurus Rex, and released four  albums under this name - three psychedelic folk and one mellow psychedelic rock.  In 1969, while developing the style for the fourth album, Bolan began to change the band's style towards electric rock, and shortened their name to T. Rex the following year. This development culminated in 1970 with the song \"Ride a White Swan\", and the group soon became pioneers of the glam rock movement.","image":"T_RexatWheeley.jpg.webp","url":"T._Rex_(band)"}
