{"title":"Megafauna","summary":"In terrestrial zoology, the megafauna (from Greek μέγας megas \"large\" and New Latin fauna \"animal life\") comprises the large or giant animals of an area, habitat, or geological period, extinct and/or extant. The most common thresholds used are weight over 45 kilograms (100 lb)[1][2][3] (i.e., having a mass comparable to or larger than a human) or over a tonne,  1,000 kilograms (2,205 lb)[1][4][5] (i.e., having a mass comparable to or larger than an ox). The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, and being the only few large animals left in a given range/area, such as white-tailed deer, thomson's gazelle, and red kangaroo.\nIn practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the Pleistocene megafauna – the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of the last ice age, such as mammoths, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and Australia became extinct within the last forty thousand years.[6] Among living animals, the term megafauna is most commonly used for the largest extant terrestrial mammals, which includes (but is not limited to)  elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and large bovines. Of these five categories of large herbivores, only bovines are presently found outside of Africa and southern Asia, but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging, with their ranges and populations continually shrinking and decreasing over time. Wild equines are another example of megafauna, but their current ranges are largely restricted to the old world, specifically Africa and Asia. Megafaunal species may be categorized according to their dietary type: megaherbivores (e.g., elephants), megacarnivores (e.g., lions), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., bears). Megafauna are also categorized by the order of animals that they belong to, which are mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates.","image":"Elephant_near_ndutu.jpg.webp"}
