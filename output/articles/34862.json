{"title":"Phosphorylation","summary":"In chemistry, phosphorylation of a molecule is the attachment of a phosphoryl group. This process and its inverse, dephosphorylation, are critical for many cellular processes in biology. Protein phosphorylation is especially important for their function; for example, this modification activates (or deactivates) almost half of the enzymes present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, thereby regulating their function.[1][2][3] Many proteins (between 1/3 to 2/3 of the proteome in eukaryotes[4][5]) are phosphorylated temporarily, as are many sugars, lipids, and other biologically-relevant molecules.","image":"Phosporylation_of_a_serine_residue%2C_before_and_after_shot.png.webp","url":"Phosphorylation"}
