{"title":"Arthur Sifton","summary":"Arthur Lewis Watkins Sifton, PC (UK), PC (Can), KC (October 26, 1858 – January 21, 1921), was a Canadian politician who served as the second premier of Alberta from 1910 until 1917. He became a minister in the federal cabinet of Canada thereafter.  Born in Canada West (now Ontario), he grew up there and in Winnipeg, where he became a lawyer.  He subsequently practised law with his brother Clifford Sifton in Brandon, where he was also active in municipal politics.  He moved west to Prince Albert in 1885 and to Calgary in 1889.  There, he was elected to the 4th and 5th North-West Legislative Assemblies; he served as a minister in the government of premier Frederick Haultain.  In 1903, the federal government, at the instigation of his brother (who was then one of its ministers), made Sifton the Chief Justice of the Northwest Territories.  After Alberta was created out of a portion of the Northwest Territories in 1905, Sifton became the first Chief Justice of Alberta in 1907 and served until 1910.","image":"Arthur_Lewis_Watkins_Sifton.jpg.webp","url":"Arthur_Sifton"}
