{"title":"Papillomaviridae","summary":"Papillomaviridae is a family of non-enveloped DNA viruses whose members are known as papillomaviruses.[1] Several hundred species of papillomaviruses, traditionally referred to as \"types\",[2] have been identified infecting all carefully inspected mammals,[2] but also other vertebrates such as birds, snakes, turtles and fish.[3][4][5] Infection by most papillomavirus types, depending on the type, is either asymptomatic (e.g. most Beta-PVs) or causes small benign tumors, known as papillomas or warts (e.g. human papillomavirus 1, HPV6 or HPV11). Papillomas caused by some types, however, such as human papillomaviruses 16 and 18, carry a risk of becoming cancerous.[6]","image":"Papillomavirus.jpg.webp"}
