{"title":"Topological space","summary":"In mathematics, a topological space is, roughly speaking, a geometrical space in which closeness is defined but cannot necessarily be measured by a numeric distance. More specifically, a topological space is a set of points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point, satisfying a set of axioms relating points and neighbourhoods.","image":"759601e482258ff7a359a7db381abf60372c5b06.svg","url":"Topological_space"}
