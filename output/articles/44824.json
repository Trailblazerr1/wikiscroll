{"title":"Theodore I Laskaris","summary":"Theodore I Laskaris or Lascaris (Greek: Θεόδωρος Κομνηνὸς Λάσκαρις, romanized: Theodōros Komnēnos Laskaris;[1] c. 1175 – November 1221) was the first Emperor of Nicaea—a successor state of the Byzantine Empire—from 1205 to his death. Although he was born to an obscure Byzantine aristocratic family, his mother was related to the imperial Komnenos clan. He married a younger daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios III Angelos in 1200. He received the title of despot before 1203, demonstrating his right to succeed his father-in-law on the throne.","image":"148_-_Theodore_I_Laskaris_(Mutinensis_-_color).png.webp","url":"Theodore_I_Laskaris"}
