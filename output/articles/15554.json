{"title":"Extinct language","summary":"An extinct language is a language that no longer has any speakers,[1] especially if the language has no living descendants.[2] In contrast, a dead language is \"one that is no longer the native language of any community\", even if it is still in use, like Latin. [3] Languages that currently have living native speakers are sometimes called modern languages to contrast them with dead languages, especially in educational contexts.","image":"Eteocypriot_writing.jpg.webp","url":"Extinct_language"}
