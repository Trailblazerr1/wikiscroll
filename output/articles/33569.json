{"title":"p53","summary":"Tumor protein P53, also known as p53, cellular tumor antigen p53 (UniProt name), the Guardian of the Genome,[5] phosphoprotein p53,  tumor suppressor p53, antigen NY-CO-13, or transformation-related protein 53 (TRP53), is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as TP53 (humans) and Trp53 (mice). This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular vertebrates, where it prevents cancer formation.[6] As such, p53 has been described as \"the guardian of the genome\" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation.[7] Hence TP53[note 1] is classified as a tumor suppressor gene.[8][9][10][11][12]","image":"P53.png.webp","url":"P53"}
