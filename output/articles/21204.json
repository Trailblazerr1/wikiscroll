{"title":"Hustler","summary":"Hustler is a monthly pornographic magazine published by Larry Flynt Publications in the United States. Introduced in 1974, it was a step forward from the Hustler Newsletter, originally conceived as cheap advertising for his strip club businesses at the time. The magazine grew from a shaky start to a peak circulation of around 3 million in the early 1980s; it has since dropped to approximately 500,000. It shows explicit views of the female genitalia, becoming one of the first major US-based magazines to do so, in contrast with relatively modest publications like Playboy.[1]","image":"Hustler_April_2004_cover.jpg.webp"}
