{"title":"Speculation","summary":"Speculation is the purchase of an asset (a commodity, goods, or real estate) with the hope that it will become more valuable in the near future. (It can also refer to short sales in which the speculator hopes for a decline in value.) In finance, speculation is also the practice of engaging in risky financial transactions in an attempt to profit from short term fluctuations in the market value of a tradable financial instrumentâ€”rather than attempting to profit from the underlying financial attributes embodied in the instrument such as value addition, return on investment, or dividends.","image":"Everybody_works_but_the_vacant_lot_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Speculation"}
