{"title":"Djedkare Isesi","summary":"Djedkare Isesi (known in Greek as Tancheres) was a pharaoh, the eighth and penultimate ruler of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt in the late 25th century to mid-24th century BC, during the Old Kingdom. Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relationship to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son, owing to the smooth transition between the two.","image":"Part_of_a_door_jamb_showing_the_cartouche_of_Djedkare_Isesi._From_the_Sun_Temple_of_Nyuserre_Ini_at_Abu_Gurob%2C_Egypt._c._2430_BCE._Neues_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"Djedkare_Isesi"}
