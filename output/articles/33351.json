{"title":"Orthomyxoviridae","summary":"Orthomyxoviridae (from Greek ὀρθός, orthós 'straight' + μύξα, mýxa 'mucus')[1] is a family of negative-sense RNA viruses. It includes seven genera: Alphainfluenzavirus, Betainfluenzavirus, Deltainfluenzavirus, Gammainfluenzavirus, Isavirus, Thogotovirus, and Quaranjavirus. The first four genera contain viruses that cause influenza in birds (see also avian influenza) and mammals, including humans. Isaviruses infect salmon; the thogotoviruses are arboviruses, infecting vertebrates and invertebrates (such as ticks and mosquitoes).[2][3][4] The Quaranjaviruses are also arboviruses, infecting vertebrates (birds) and invertebrates (arthropods).","image":"Fimmu-09-01581-g001.jpg.webp","url":"Orthomyxoviridae"}
