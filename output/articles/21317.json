{"title":"Hypoactive sexual desire disorder","summary":"Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), hyposexuality or inhibited sexual desire (ISD) is considered a sexual dysfunction in some jurisdictions and is characterized as a lack or absence of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity, as judged by a clinician. For this to be regarded as a disorder, it must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulties and not be better accounted for by another mental disorder, a drug (legal or illegal), or some other medical condition. A person with ISD will not start, or respond to their partner's desire for, sexual activity.[1] HSDD affects approximately 10% of all pre-menopausal women in the United States, or about 6 million women.[2]","image":"Sexual_orientation_-_4_symbols.svg.png.webp"}
