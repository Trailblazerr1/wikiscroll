{"title":"Beograd-class destroyer","summary":"The Beograd class of destroyers consisted of three ships built for the Royal Yugoslav Navy in the late 1930s, to a French design. Beograd was constructed in France and Zagreb and Ljubljana were built in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Zagreb was scuttled to prevent its capture, and the other two were captured by the Italians. The Royal Italian Navy operated the two captured ships as convoy escorts between Italy, the Aegean Sea, and North Africa. One was lost in the Gulf of Tunis in April 1943; the other was seized by the Germans in September 1943 after the Italian surrender and was subsequently operated by the German Navy. There are conflicting reports about the fate of the last ship, but it was lost in the final weeks of the war.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-185-0116-22A%2C_Bucht_von_Kotor_(-)%2C_jugoslawische_Schiffe.jpg.webp","url":"Beograd-class_destroyer"}
