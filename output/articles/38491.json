{"title":"Root mean square","summary":"In mathematics and its applications, the root mean square (RMS or RMS or rms) is defined as the square root of the mean square (the arithmetic mean of the squares of a set of numbers).[1]\nThe RMS is also known as the quadratic mean[2][3] and is a particular case of the generalized mean with exponentÂ 2. RMS can also be defined for a continuously varying function in terms of an integral of the squares of the instantaneous values during a cycle.","image":"0416a78ac28f73940431b62ab4f8fd9ee84bbfde.svg"}
