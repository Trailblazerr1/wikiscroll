{"title":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis","summary":"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, progressive illness of the respiratory system, characterized by the thickening and stiffening of lung tissue, associated with the formation of scar tissue. It is a type of chronic scarring lung disease characterized by a progressive and irreversible decline in lung function.[3][4] The tissue in the lungs becomes thick and stiff, which affects the tissue that surrounds the air sacs in the lungs.[5] Symptoms typically include gradual onset of shortness of breath and a dry cough.[1] Other changes may include feeling tired, and abnormally large and dome shaped finger and toenails (nail clubbing).[1] Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.[1]","image":"Ipf_NIH.jpg.webp"}
