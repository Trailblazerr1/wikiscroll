{"title":"Zumwalt-class destroyer","summary":"The Zumwalt-class destroyer is a class of three United States Navy guided missile destroyers designed as multi-mission stealth ships with a focus on land attack. It is a multi-role class that was designed for secondary roles of surface warfare and anti-aircraft warfare and originally designed with a primary role of naval gunfire support. The class design emerged from the DD-21 \"land attack destroyer\" program as \"DD(X)\" and was intended to take the role of battleships in meeting a congressional mandate for naval fire support.[12] The ship is designed around its two Advanced Gun Systems, their turrets and magazines, and unique Long Range Land Attack Projectile (LRLAP) ammunition.[9] LRLAP procurement was cancelled, rendering the guns unusable,[9] so the Navy re-purposed the ships for surface warfare.[13]","image":"Future_USS_Zumwalt's_first_underway_at_sea.jpg.webp","url":"Zumwalt-class_destroyer"}
