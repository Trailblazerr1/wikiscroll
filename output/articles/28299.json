{"title":"Manila galleon","summary":"The Manila galleons (Spanish: Gale√≥n de Manila; Filipino: Galyon ng Maynila) were Spanish trading ships which for two and a half centuries linked the Spanish Captaincy General of the Philippines with New Spain across the Pacific Ocean, making one or two round-trip voyages per year between the ports of Acapulco and Manila, which were both part of New Spain. The name of the galleon changed to reflect the city that the ship sailed from.[1] The term Manila galleon can also refer to the trade route itself between Acapulco and Manila, which lasted from 1565 to 1815.","image":"Carta_Hydrographica_y_Chorographica_de_la_Yslas_Filipinas_MANILA%2C_1734.jpg.webp","url":"Manila_galleon"}
