{"title":"Lorraine Hansberry","summary":"Lorraine Vivian Hansberry (May 19, 1930 – January 12, 1965) was a playwright and writer.[1] She was the first African-American female author to have a play performed on Broadway. Her best known work, the play A Raisin in the Sun, highlights the lives of Black Americans living under racial segregation in Chicago. The title of the play was taken from the poem \"Harlem\" by Langston Hughes: \"What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?\" At the age of 29, she won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award — making her the first African-American dramatist, the fifth woman, and the youngest playwright to do so.[2] Hansberry's family had struggled against segregation, challenging a restrictive covenant in the 1940 US Supreme Court case Hansberry v. Lee.","image":"Lorraine_Hansberry.jpg.webp"}
