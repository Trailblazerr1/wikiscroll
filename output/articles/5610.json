{"title":"Bariatric surgery","summary":"Bariatric surgery (or weight loss surgery) includes a variety of procedures performed on people who are obese. Long term weight loss through standard of care procedures (Roux en-Y bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) is largely achieved by altering  gut hormone levels that are responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to a new hormonal weight set point.[1] Bariatric surgery is a hormonal surgery in these procedures, for which the alteration in gut hormones develops as a result of the procedure's restriction and malabsorption.[1]","image":"Biliopancreatic_Diversion.png.webp","url":"Bariatric_surgery"}
