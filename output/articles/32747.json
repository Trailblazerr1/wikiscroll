{"title":"Oedipus complex","summary":"The Oedipus complex (also spelled Å’dipus complex) is a concept of psychoanalytic theory. Sigmund Freud introduced the concept in his book Interpretation of Dreams (1899) and coined the expression in his paper A Special Type of Choice of Object made by Men (1910).[1][2] In Freud's original formulation, the Oedipus complex is a purportedly universal phase in the life of a young boy in which he hates his father and wishes to have sex with his mother. These wishes may be unconscious.","image":"IngresOdipusAndSphinx.jpg.webp"}
