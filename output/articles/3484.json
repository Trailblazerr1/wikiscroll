{"title":"Anatomical terms of location","summary":"Standard anatomical terms of location are used to unambiguously describe the anatomy of animals, including humans. The terms, typically derived from Latin or Greek roots, describe something in its standard anatomical position. This position provides a definition of what is at the front (\"anterior\"), behind (\"posterior\") and so on. As part of defining and describing terms, the body is described through the use of anatomical planes and anatomical axes.","image":"View_of_Viscera_Page_82.jpg.webp","url":"Anatomical_terms_of_location"}
