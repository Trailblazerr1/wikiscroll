{"title":"Sirenia","summary":"The Sirenia (/saɪˈriːniə/), commonly referred to as sea-cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. The Sirenia currently comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller's sea cow) and Trichechidae (manatees namely the Amazonian manatee, West Indian manatee, and West African manatee) with a total of four species.[2] The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct. Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago (mya). The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene (30-35 mya).[3][4]","image":"Sirenia_Diversity.jpg.webp","url":"Sirenia"}
