{"title":"Diolkos","summary":"The Diolkos (Δίολκος, from the Greek dia διά, \"across\", and holkos ὁλκός, \"portage machine\"[1]) was a paved trackway near Corinth in Ancient Greece which enabled boats to be moved overland across the Isthmus of Corinth. The shortcut allowed ancient vessels to avoid the long and dangerous circumnavigation of the Peloponnese peninsula. The phrase \"as fast as a Corinthian\", penned by the comic playwright Aristophanes, indicates that the trackway was common knowledge and had acquired a reputation for swiftness.[2]","image":"Istmo_de_Corinto_ESC_large_ISS011_ISS011-E-13188.JPG.webp","url":"Diolkos"}
