{"title":"Chemical equation","summary":"A chemical equation is the symbolic representation of a chemical reaction in the form of symbols and formulae, wherein the reactant entities are given on the left-hand side and the product entities on the right-hand side with a plus sign between the entities in both the reactants and the products and an arrow that points towards the products, and shows the direction of the reaction.[1] The coefficients next to the symbols and formulae of entities are the absolute values of the stoichiometric numbers. The first chemical equation was diagrammed by Jean Beguin in 1615.[2]","image":"Baker-Venkataraman-Rearrangement_V.1.svg.png.webp"}
