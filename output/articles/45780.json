{"title":"Transistor–transistor logic","summary":"Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors. Its name signifies that transistors perform both the logic function (the first \"transistor\") and the amplifying function (the second \"transistor\"), as opposed to resistor–transistor logic (RTL) or diode–transistor logic (DTL).","image":"TTL_Clock.jpg.webp","url":"Transistor–transistor_logic"}
