{"title":"Basement","summary":"A basement or cellar is one or more floors of a building that are completely or partly below the ground floor.[1] It generally is used as a utility space for a building, where such items as the boiler, water heater, breaker panel or fuse box, car park, and air-conditioning system are located; so also are amenities such as the electrical distribution system and cable television distribution point. In cities with high property prices, such as London, basements are often fitted out to a high standard and used as living space.","image":"Basement-after.jpg.webp"}
