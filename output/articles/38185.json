{"title":"Robert Kubica","summary":"Robert Józef Kubica (Polish pronunciation: [ˈrɔbɛrt kuˈbit͡sa] (listen); born 7 December 1984) is a Polish racing driver. He became the first and the only Polish driver to compete in Formula One, as of 2021. Between 2006 and 2009 he drove for the BMW Sauber F1 team, promoted from test driver to race driver during 2006. In June 2008, Kubica took his maiden Formula One victory in the Canadian Grand Prix. That season he led the championship at one stage, before finishing fourth overall, his best career position. Kubica drove for Renault in 2010 and was set to remain with the team in 2011. Several years later Kubica confirmed he had signed a pre-contract for the 2012 season with Ferrari, a move that was eventually cancelled by his devastating rally crash in early 2011.[2]","image":"2019_Formula_One_tests_Barcelona%2C_Kubica_(32309897777).jpg.webp","url":"Robert_Kubica"}
