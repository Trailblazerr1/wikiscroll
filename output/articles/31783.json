{"title":"Nevermind","summary":"Nevermind is the second studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991, by DGC Records. Produced by Butch Vig, it was Nirvana's first release on the DGC label, as well as the first to feature drummer Dave Grohl. Nevermind features a more polished, radio-friendly sound than the band's prior work, and is therefore considered a significant departure from their debut album, Bleach. Recording for Nevermind took place at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California, and Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in May and June 1991, with mastering being completed in August of that year at The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California.","image":"NirvanaNevermindalbumcover.jpg.webp","url":"Nevermind"}
