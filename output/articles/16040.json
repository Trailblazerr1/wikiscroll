{"title":"Ferris wheel","summary":"A Ferris wheel (or big wheel in the United Kingdom, also called giant wheels or observation wheels) is an amusement ride consisting of a rotating upright wheel with multiple passenger-carrying components (commonly referred to as passenger cars, cabins, tubs, gondolas, capsules, or pods) attached to the rim in such a way that as the wheel turns, they are kept upright, usually by gravity. Some of the largest modern Ferris wheels have cars mounted on the outside of the rim, with electric motors to independently rotate each car to keep it upright. These cars are often referred to as capsules or pods.","image":"Downtown%2C_Las_Vegas%2C_NV%2C_USA_-_panoramio_(6).jpg.webp","url":"Ferris_wheel"}
