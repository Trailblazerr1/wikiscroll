{"title":"Aromaticity","summary":"In chemistry, aromaticity is a property of cyclic (ring-shaped), typically planar (flat) structures with pi bonds in resonance (those containing delocalized electrons) that gives increased stability compared to other geometric or connective arrangements with the same set of atoms. Aromatic rings are very stable and do not break apart easily. Organic compounds that are not aromatic are classified as aliphatic compoundsâ€”they might be cyclic, but only aromatic rings have enhanced stability.","image":"Benzene_resonance_structures.png.webp","url":"Aromaticity"}
