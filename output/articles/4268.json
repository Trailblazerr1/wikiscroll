{"title":"Archaic Greece","summary":"Archaic Greece was the period in Greek history lasting from circa 800 BC to the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC,[1] following the Greek Dark Ages and succeeded by the Classical period. In the archaic period, Greeks settled across the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, as far as Marseille in the west and Trapezus (Trebizond) in the east; and by the end of the archaic period, they were part of a trade network that spanned the entire Mediterranean.","image":"Map_of_Greece%2C_Archipelago_and_part_of_Anadoli%3B_Louis_Stanislas_d'Arcy_Delarochette_1791.jpg.webp","url":"Archaic_Greece"}
