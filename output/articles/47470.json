{"title":"Vintage","summary":"Vintage, in winemaking, is the process of picking grapes and creating the finished productâ€”wine (see Harvest (wine)). A vintage wine is one made from grapes that were all, or primarily,  grown and harvested in a single specified year. In certain wines, it can denote quality, as in Port wine, where Port houses make and declare vintage Port in their best years. From this tradition, a common, though not strictly correct, usage applies the term to any wine that is perceived to be particularly old or of a particularly high quality.","image":"Cup_vintage_Cdm_Paris_320_n1.jpg.webp","url":"Vintage"}
