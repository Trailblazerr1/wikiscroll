{"title":"Block cipher mode of operation","summary":"In cryptography, a block cipher mode of operation is an algorithm that uses a block cipher to provide information security such as confidentiality or authenticity.[1] A block cipher by itself is only suitable for the secure cryptographic transformation (encryption or decryption) of one fixed-length group of bits called a block.[2] A mode of operation describes how to repeatedly apply a cipher's single-block operation to securely transform amounts of data larger than a block.[3][4][5]","image":"GCM-Galois_Counter_Mode_with_IV.svg.png.webp","url":"Block_cipher_mode_of_operation"}
