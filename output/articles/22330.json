{"title":"Intrauterine device","summary":"An intrauterine device (IUD), also known as intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD or ICD) or coil,[3] is a small, often T-shaped birth control device that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. IUDs are one form of long-acting reversible birth control (LARC).[4]  One study found that female family planning providers choose LARC methods more often (41.7%) than the general public (12.1%).[5] Among birth control methods, IUDs, along with other contraceptive implants, result in the greatest satisfaction among users.[6]","image":"IUD_with_scale.jpg.webp","url":"Intrauterine_device"}
