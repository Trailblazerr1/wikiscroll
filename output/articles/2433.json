{"title":"Agrippina the Elder","summary":"Agrippina \"the Elder\" (also, in Latin, Agrippina Germanici,[1] \"Germanicus's Agrippina\"; c. 14 BC – AD 33) was a prominent member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. She was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (a close supporter of the first Roman emperor, Augustus) and Augustus' daughter, Julia the Elder. Her brothers Lucius and Gaius Caesar were the adoptive sons of Augustus, and were his heirs until their deaths in AD 2 and 4, respectively. Following their deaths, her second cousin Germanicus was made the adoptive son of Tiberius, Augustus' stepson, as part of Augustus' succession scheme in the adoptions of AD 4 (in which Tiberius was adopted by Augustus). As a result of the adoption, Agrippina was wed to Germanicus in order to bring him closer to the Julian family.","image":"Agrippina_Major_portrait_Istanbul_Archaeological_Museum_-_inv._2164_T.jpg.webp"}
