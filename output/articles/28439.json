{"title":"Margaret Brown","summary":"Margaret Brown (née Tobin; July 18, 1867 – October 26, 1932), posthumously known as \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\", was an American socialite and philanthropist. She unsuccessfully encouraged the crew in Lifeboat No. 6 to return to the debris field of the 1912 sinking of RMS Titanic to look for survivors.[1] During her lifetime, her friends called her \"Maggie\", but even by her death, obituaries referred to her as the \"Unsinkable Molly Brown\".[2] The reference was further reinforced by a 1960 Broadway musical based on her life and its 1964 film adaptation which were both entitled The Unsinkable Molly Brown.","image":"Margaret_Brown%2C_3qtr_view%2C_with_chair.jpg.webp"}
