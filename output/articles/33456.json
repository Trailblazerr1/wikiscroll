{"title":"Outer Hebrides","summary":"The Outer Hebrides (/ˈhɛbrɪdiːz/) or Western Isles (Scottish Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan Siar [nə ˈhelanən ˈʃiəɾ] (listen) or Na h-Eileanan an Iar [nə ˈhelanən əˈɲiəɾ] (listen); Scots: Waster Isles), sometimes known as Na h-Innse Gall (\"islands of the strangers\") or the Long Isle/Long Island (Scottish Gaelic: An t-Eilean Fada), is an island chain off the west coast of mainland Scotland.[Note 1] The islands are geographically coextensive with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, one of the 32 unitary council areas of Scotland. They form part of the archipelago of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the waters of the Minch, the Little Minch, and the Sea of the Hebrides. Scottish Gaelic is the predominant spoken language, although in a few areas English speakers form a majority.","image":"Outer_Hebrides_by_Sentinel-2.jpg.webp","url":"Outer_Hebrides"}
