{"title":"Mitral valve stenosis","summary":"Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterized by the narrowing of the orifice of the mitral valve of the heart.[1] It is almost always caused by rheumatic valvular heart disease. Normally, the mitral valve is about 5 cm2 during diastole. Any decrease in area below 2 cm2 causes mitral stenosis. Early diagnosis of mitral stenosis in pregnancy is very important as the heart cannot tolerate increased cardiac output demand as in the case of exercise and pregnancy. Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of resulting left atrial enlargement, which can lead to systemic thromboembolic complications like stroke.[2]","image":"Mitral_stenosis%2C_gross_pathology_20G0015_lores.jpg.webp"}
