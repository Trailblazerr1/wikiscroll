{"title":"Poetry of Maya Angelou","summary":"Maya Angelou, an African-American writer who is best known for her seven autobiographies, was also a prolific and successful poet.  She has been called \"the black woman's poet laureate\", and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans.[1]  Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with trauma, as she described in her first and most well-known autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.  She became a poet after a series of occupations as a young adult, including as a cast member of a European tour of Porgy and Bess, and a performer of calypso music in nightclubs in the 1950s.  Many of the songs she wrote during that period later found their way to her later poetry collections.  She eventually gave up performing for a writing career.","image":"Angelou_at_Clinton_inauguration.jpg.webp"}
