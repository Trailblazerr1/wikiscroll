{"title":"Insect","summary":"Insects (from Latin insectum) are pancrustacean hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta. They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum. Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. Insects are the most diverse group of animals; they include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms.[1][2] The total number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million;[1][3][4] potentially over 90% of the animal life forms on Earth are insects.[4][5] Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, which are dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans, which recent research has indicated insects are nested within.","image":"Insecta_Diversity.jpg.webp"}
