{"title":"Stimulant","summary":"Stimulants (also often referred to as psychostimulants or colloquially as uppers) is an overarching term that covers many drugs including those that increase activity of the central nervous system and the body,[1] drugs that are pleasurable and invigorating, or drugs that have sympathomimetic effects.[2] Stimulants are widely used throughout the world as prescription medicines as well as without a prescription (either legally or illicitly) as performance-enhancing or recreational drugs. Among narcotics, stimulants produce a noticeable crash or comedown at the end of their effects. The most frequently prescribed stimulants as of 2013 were lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), and amphetamine.[3] It was estimated in 2015 that the percentage of the world population that had used cocaine during a year was 0.4%. For the category \"amphetamines and prescription stimulants\" (with \"amphetamines\" including amphetamine and methamphetamine) the value was 0.7%, and for Ecstasy 0.4%.[4]","image":"Ritalin-SR-20mg-full.jpg.webp"}
