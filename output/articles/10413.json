{"title":"Coconut milk","summary":"Coconut milk is an opaque, milky-white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts.[1] The opacity and rich taste of coconut milk are due to its high oil content, most of which is saturated fat. Coconut milk is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and East Africa. It is also used for cooking in the Caribbean, tropical Latin America, and West Africa, where coconuts were introduced during the colonial era.","image":"Cononut_milk.JPG.webp","url":"Coconut_milk"}
