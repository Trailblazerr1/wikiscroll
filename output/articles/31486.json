{"title":"Naturalization","summary":"Naturalization (or naturalisation) is the legal act or process by which a non-citizen of a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country.[1] It may be done automatically by a statute, i.e., without any effort on the part of the individual, or it may involve an application or a motion and approval by legal authorities.[2] The rules of naturalization vary from country to country but typically include a promise to obey and uphold that country's laws,[3] taking and subscribing to an oath of allegiance, and may specify other requirements such as a minimum legal residency and adequate knowledge of the national dominant language or culture. To counter multiple citizenship, most countries require that applicants for naturalization renounce any other citizenship that they currently hold, but whether this renunciation actually causes loss of original citizenship, as seen by the host country and by the original country, will depend on the laws of the countries involved.","image":"US_Navy_090528-N-3207B-034_Sailors%2C_Marines%2C_Soldiers_and_Airmen_recite_the_pledge_of_allegiance_during_a_naturalization_ceremony_at_the_USS_Midway_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"Naturalization"}
