{"title":"Exterior algebra","summary":"In mathematics, the exterior product or wedge product of vectors is an algebraic construction used in geometry to study areas, volumes, and their higher-dimensional analogues. The exterior product of two vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n, denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        ∧\n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v}\n  \n, is called a bivector and lives in a space called the exterior square, a vector space that is distinct from the original space of vectors.  The magnitude[3] of \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        ∧\n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v}\n  \n can be interpreted as the area of the parallelogram with sides \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n, which in three dimensions can also be computed using the cross product of the two vectors. (Alternatively, it may be interpreted as the area of a triangle with sides \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n.) More generally, all parallel plane surfaces with the same orientation and area have the same bivector as a measure of their oriented area. Like the cross product, the exterior product is anticommutative, meaning that \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n        ∧\n        v\n        =\n        −\n        (\n        v\n        ∧\n        u\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u\\wedge v=-(v\\wedge u)}\n  \n for all vectors \n  \n    \n      \n        u\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle u}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n, but, unlike the cross product, the exterior product is associative.","image":"c3e6bb763d22c20916ed4f0bb6bd49d7470cffd8.svg"}
