{"title":"Dhole","summary":"The dhole (/doʊl/; Cuon alpinus) is a canid native to Central, South, East, and Southeast Asia. Other English names for the species include Asian wild dog, Asiatic wild dog,[2] Indian wild dog,[3] whistling dog, red dog,[4] and mountain wolf.[5] It is genetically close to species within the genus Canis,[6]: Fig. 10  but distinct in several anatomical aspects: its skull is convex rather than concave in profile, it lacks a third lower molar[7] and the upper molars sport only a single cusp as opposed to between two and four.[8] During the Pleistocene, the dhole ranged throughout Asia, Europe, and North America but became restricted to its historical range 12,000–18,000 years ago.[9]","image":"Dhole_in_its_habitat_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Dhole"}
