{"title":"Ornithology","summary":"Ornithology is a branch of zoology that concerns the \"methodological study and consequent knowledge of birds with all that relates to them.\"[1] Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds.[2] It has also been an area with a large contribution made by amateurs in terms of time, resources, and financial support. Studies on birds have helped develop key concepts in biology including evolution, behaviour and ecology such as the definition of species, the process of speciation, instinct, learning, ecological niches, guilds, island biogeography, phylogeography, and conservation.[3]","image":"Banding_Marbled_Godwit_on_Bowdoin_NWR_(12820314955).jpg.webp"}
