{"title":"Carousel","summary":"A carousel (American English: from French carrousel and Italian carosello), roundabout (British English),[1] hurdy-gurdy (Australian English, esp. SA),[2] or merry-go-round, is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The \"seats\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper (however see ‘direction of rotation’ below). Other popular names are jumper, horseabout, horse tornado and flying horses.","image":"ManègeLR1.jpg.webp"}
