{"title":"Candida albicans","summary":"Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogenic yeast[4] that is a common member of the human gut flora. It can also survive outside the human body.[5][6] It is detected in the gastrointestinal tract and mouth in 40–60% of healthy adults.[7][8] It is usually a commensal organism, but it can become pathogenic in immunocompromised individuals under a variety of conditions.[8][9] It is one of the few species of the genus Candida that causes the human infection candidiasis, which results from an overgrowth of the fungus.[8][9] Candidiasis is, for example, often observed in HIV-infected patients.[10] C. albicans is the most common fungal species isolated from biofilms either formed on (permanent) implanted medical devices or on human tissue.[11][12] C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata are together responsible for 50–90% of all cases of candidiasis in humans.[9][13][14] A mortality rate of 40% has been reported for patients with systemic candidiasis due to C. albicans.[15] By one estimate, invasive candidiasis contracted in a hospital causes 2,800 to 11,200 deaths yearly in the US.[16] Nevertheless, these numbers may not truly reflect the true extent of damage this organism causes, given new studies indicating that C. albicans can cross the blood brain barrier.[17][18]","image":"Candida_Gram_stain.jpg.webp","url":"Candida_albicans"}
