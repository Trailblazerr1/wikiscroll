{"title":"List of Grand Tour general classification winners","summary":"The Grand Tours are the three most prestigious multi-week stage races in professional road bicycle racing.[1] The competitions are the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a Espa√±a, contested annually in that order. They are the only stage races permitted to last longer than 14 days.[2] No cyclist has won all three Grand Tours in the same calendar year, but Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Chris Froome have won all three in succession (thus holding all titles at the same time); the only other cyclists to win all three Grand Tours at some point in their career are Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Alberto Contador, and Vincenzo Nibali.[3] Contador is the youngest, at 25 years, to win every Tour.[4] It is rare for cyclists to ride all Grand Tours in the same year; in 2004, for example, 474 cyclists started in one of the Grand Tours, 68 rode two and only two cyclists started all three.[5]","image":"Eddy_Merckx_Molteni_1973.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Grand_Tour_general_classification_winners"}
