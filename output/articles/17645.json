{"title":"Generalized coordinates","summary":"In analytical mechanics, the term generalized coordinates refers to the parameters that describe the configuration of the system relative to some reference configuration.   These parameters must uniquely define the configuration of the system relative to the reference configuration.[1] This is done assuming that this can be done with a single chart. The generalized velocities are the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates of the system.","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg"}
