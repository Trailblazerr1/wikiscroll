{"title":"History of Minnesota","summary":"The history of the U.S. state of Minnesota is shaped by its original Native American residents, European exploration and settlement, and the emergence of industries made possible by the state's natural resources. Minnesota achieved prominence through fur trading, logging, and farming, and later through railroads, and iron mining. While those industries remain important, the state's economy is now driven by banking, computers, and health care.","image":"Fort_Snelling_Round_Tower.JPG.webp","url":"History_of_Minnesota"}
