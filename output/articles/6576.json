{"title":"Billboard charts","summary":"The Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of songs and albums in the United States and elsewhere.  The results are published in Billboard magazine. Billboard biz, the online extension of the Billboard charts, provides additional weekly charts,[1] as well as year-end charts.[2]  The charts may be dedicated to a specific genre such as R&B, country, or rock, or they may cover all genres. The charts can be ranked according to sales, streams, or airplay, and for main song charts such as the Hot 100 song chart, all three data are used to compile the charts.[3]  For the Billboard 200 album chart, streams and track sales are included in addition to album sales.[4]","image":"BillboardLogo2013.svg.png.webp"}
