{"title":"Alto saxophone","summary":"The alto saxophone, also referred to as the alto sax or simply the alto, is a member of the saxophone family of woodwind instruments.  Invented by Belgian instrument designer Adolphe Sax in the 1840s and patented in 1846, it is pitched in Eâ™­ and smaller than the tenor but larger than the soprano. It is the most common saxophone and is commonly used in popular music, concert bands, chamber music, solo repertoire, military bands, marching bands, and jazz (such as big bands, jazz combos, swing music). The fingerings of the different saxophones are all the same so a saxophone player can play any type of saxophone.","image":"Yamaha_Saxophone_YAS-62.png.webp"}
