{"title":"Rust Belt","summary":"The Rust Belt is a region of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States that has been experiencing industrial decline starting around 1980. The U.S. manufacturing sector as a percentage of the U.S. GDP peaked in 1953 and has been in decline since, while major U.S. cities in the Northeast and Midwest (such as Buffalo,Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit,  Indianapolis, Jersey City, Kansas City, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Duluth, Minnesota, Milwaukee, Newark, Pittsburgh, Rochester,  St. Louis, and Toledo) saw or are continuing to see total population declines greater than one-tenth of peak U.S. Census populations typically starting around 1950. It is made up largely of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, though definitions vary. Rust refers to the deindustrialization, economic decline, population loss, and urban decay due to the shrinking of its once-powerful industrial sector, such as steel production, automobile manufacturing, and coal mining. The term gained popularity in the U.S. in the 1980s,[1] when it was commonly contrasted with the Sun Belt, which was surging then.","image":"Total_mfctrg_jobs_change_54-02.png.webp","url":"Rust_Belt"}
