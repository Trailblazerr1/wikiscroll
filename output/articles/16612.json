{"title":"Football Australia","summary":"Football Australia is the governing body of soccer, futsal, and beach soccer within Australia,[1] headquartered in Sydney. Although the first governing body of the sport was founded in 1911, Football Australia in its current form was only established in 1963 as the Australian Soccer Federation. It was later reconstituted in 2003 as the Australian Soccer Association before adopting the name of Football Federation Australia in 2005. In contemporary identification, a corporate decision was undertaken to institute that name to deliver a 'more united football' in deliberation from current CEO James Johnson. In December 2020, the name was changed to Football Australia.","image":"Football_Australia_logo_2020.png.webp","url":"Football_Australia"}
