{"title":"Oryzomys gorgasi","summary":"Oryzomys gorgasi, also known as Gorgas's oryzomys[4] or Gorgas's rice rat,[1] is a rodent in the genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae. First recorded in 1967, it is known from only a few localities, including a freshwater swamp in the lowlands of northwestern Colombia and a mangrove islet in northwestern Venezuela. It reportedly formerly occurred on the island of Cura√ßao off northwestern Venezuela; this extinct population has been described as a separate species, Oryzomys curasoae, but does not differ morphologically from mainland populations.","image":"Status_iucn3.1_EN.svg.png.webp"}
