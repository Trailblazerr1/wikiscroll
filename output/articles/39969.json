{"title":"Self-harm","summary":"Self-harm or self-injury is intentional behaviour that is considered harmful to oneself. This is most commonly regarded as direct injury of one's own skin tissues usually without a suicidal intention.[1][2][3] Other terms such as cutting and self-mutilation have been used for any self-harming behavior regardless of suicidal intent.[2][4][5][6] The most common form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut the skin. Other forms include scratching, hitting, or burning body parts. While earlier usage included interfering with wound healing, excessive skin-picking, hair-pulling, and the ingestion of toxins,[2][7][8] current usage distinguishes these behaviors from self-harm. Likewise, tissue damage from drug abuse or eating disorders is not considered self-harm because it is ordinarily an unintended side-effect.[9]","image":"SelfHarm2017.jpg.webp","url":"Self-harm"}
