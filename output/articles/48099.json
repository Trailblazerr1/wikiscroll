{"title":"Weald","summary":"The Weald (/ˈwiːld/, WEELD) is an area of South East England between the parallel chalk escarpments of the North and the South Downs. It crosses the counties of Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. It has three separate parts: the sandstone \"High Weald\" in the centre; the clay \"Low Weald\" periphery; and the Greensand Ridge, which stretches around the north and west of the Weald and includes its highest points. The Weald once was covered with forest, and its name, Old English in origin, signifies \"woodland\". The term is still used today, as scattered farms and villages sometimes refer to the Weald in their names.","image":"WealdfromDowns.JPG.webp","url":"Weald"}
