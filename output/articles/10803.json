{"title":"Compsognathus","summary":"Compsognathus (/kɒmpˈsɒɡnəθəs/;[1] Greek kompsos/κομψός; \"elegant\", \"refined\" or \"dainty\", and gnathos/γνάθος; \"jaw\")[2] is a genus of small, bipedal, carnivorous theropod dinosaur. Members of its single species Compsognathus longipes could grow to around the size of a turkey. They lived about 150 million years ago, during the Tithonian age of the late Jurassic period, in what is now Europe. Paleontologists have found two well-preserved fossils, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century later. Today, C. longipes is the only recognized species, although the larger specimen discovered in France in the 1970s was once thought to belong to a separate species and named C. corallestris.","image":"Compy.jpg.webp","url":"Compsognathus"}
