{"title":"CIELAB color space","summary":"The CIELAB color space also referred to as L*a*b*  is a color space defined by the International Commission on Illumination (abbreviated CIE) in 1976. (Referring to CIELAB as \"Lab\" without asterisks should be avoided to prevent confusion with Hunter Lab.) It expresses color as three values: L* for perceptual lightness, and a* and b* for the four unique colors of human vision: red, green, blue, and yellow.  CIELAB was intended as a perceptually uniform space, where a given numerical change corresponds to similar perceived change in color. While the LAB space is not truly perceptually uniform, it nevertheless is useful in industry for detecting small differences in color.","image":"CIELAB_color_space_top_view.png.webp"}
