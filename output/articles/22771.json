{"title":"Jack and the Beanstalk","summary":"\"Jack and the Beanstalk\" is an English fairy tale. It appeared as \"The Story of Jack Spriggins and the Enchanted Bean\" in 1734[1] and as Benjamin Tabart's moralized \"The History of Jack and the Bean-Stalk\" in 1807.[2] Henry Cole, publishing under pen name Felix Summerly, popularized the tale in The Home Treasury (1845),[3] and Joseph Jacobs rewrote it in English Fairy Tales (1890).[4] Jacobs' version is most commonly reprinted today, and is believed to be closer to the oral versions than Tabart's because it lacks the moralizing.[5]","image":"Jack_and_the_Beanstalk_Giant_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_17034.jpg.webp"}
