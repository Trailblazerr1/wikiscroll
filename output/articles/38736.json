{"title":"Ruminant","summary":"Ruminants (suborder Ruminantia) are large hoofed herbivorous grazing or browsing mammals that are able to acquire nutrients from plant-based food by fermenting it in a specialized stomach prior to digestion, principally through microbial actions. The process, which takes place in the front part of the digestive system and therefore is called foregut fermentation, typically requires the fermented ingesta (known as cud) to be regurgitated and chewed again. The process of rechewing the cud to further break down plant matter and stimulate digestion is called rumination.[2][3] The word \"ruminant\" comes from the Latin ruminare, which means \"to chew over again\".","image":"Ruminantia.jpg.webp"}
