{"title":"Keratinocyte","summary":"Keratinocytes are the primary type of cell found in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin.  In humans, they constitute 90% of epidermal skin cells. [1] Basal cells in the basal layer (stratum basale) of the skin are sometimes referred to as basal keratinocytes.[2] Keratinocytes form a barrier against environmental damage by heat, UV radiation, water loss, pathogenic bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. A number of structural proteins, enzymes, lipids, and antimicrobial peptides contribute to maintain the important barrier function of the skin. Keratinocytes differentiate from epidermal stem cells in the lower part of the epidermis and migrate towards the surface, finally becoming corneocytes and eventually be shed off,[3][4][5][6] which happens every 40-56 days in human.[7]","image":"Micrograph_of_keratinocytes%2C_basal_cells_and_melanocytes_in_the_epidermis.jpg.webp","url":"Keratinocyte"}
