{"title":"File system","summary":"In computing, file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved.[1] Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stopped and the next began, or where any piece of data was located when it was time to retrieve it. By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified. Taking its name from the way paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a \"file.\" The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a \"file system.\"","image":"Operating_system_placement.svg.png.webp","url":"File_system"}
