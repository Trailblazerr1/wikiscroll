{"title":"Seventh-day Adventist Church","summary":"The Seventh-day Adventist Church[lower-alpha 1] is a Protestant Christian denomination[3][4] which is distinguished by its observance of Saturday,[5] the seventh day of the week in Christian and Jewish calendars, as the Sabbath,[4] and its emphasis on the imminent Second Coming (advent) of Jesus Christ. The denomination grew out of the Millerite movement in the United States during the mid-19th century and it was formally established in 1863.[6] Among its co-founders was Ellen G. White, whose extensive writings are still held in high regard by the church.[7] Much of the theology of the Seventh-day Adventist Church corresponds to common evangelical Christian teachings, such as the Trinity and the infallibility of Scripture. Distinctive post-tribulation teachings include the unconscious state of the dead and the doctrine of an investigative judgment. The church is known for its emphasis on diet and health, including adhering to Kosher food laws, advocating vegetarianism, and its holistic understanding of the person.[8][9] It is likewise known for its promotion of religious liberty, and its conservative principles and lifestyle.[10]","image":"Adventist_Symbol.svg.png.webp","url":"Seventh-day_Adventist_Church"}
