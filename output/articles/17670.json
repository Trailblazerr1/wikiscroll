{"title":"Genetic variation","summary":"Genetic variation is the difference in DNA among individuals[2] or the differences between populations.[3]  There are multiple sources of genetic variation, including mutation and genetic recombination.[4]  Mutations are the ultimate sources of genetic variation, but other mechanisms such as sexual reproduction and genetic drift contribute to it as well.[3]","image":"Darwin's_finches_by_Gould.jpg.webp","url":"Genetic_variation"}
