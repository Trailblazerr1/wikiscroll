{"title":"Rhodesia","summary":"Rhodesia (/roʊˈdiːʒə/, /roʊˈdiːʃə/),[1] officially from 1970 the Republic of Rhodesia,[2] was an unrecognised state in Southern Africa from 1965 to 1979, equivalent in territory to modern Zimbabwe. Rhodesia was the de facto successor state to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia, which had been self-governing since achieving responsible government in 1923. A landlocked nation, Rhodesia was bordered by South Africa to the south, Bechuanaland (later Botswana) to the southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique (a Portuguese province until 1975) to the east. From 1965 to 1979, Rhodesia was one of two independent states on the African continent governed by a white minority of European descent and culture, the other being South Africa.","image":"Flag_of_Rhodesia_(1968–1979).svg.png.webp","url":"Rhodesia"}
