{"title":"Bell number","summary":"In combinatorial mathematics, the Bell numbers count the possible partitions of a set. These numbers have been studied by mathematicians since the 19th century, and their roots go back to medieval Japan.[1] In an example of Stigler's law of eponymy, they are named after Eric Temple Bell, who wrote about them in the 1930s.","image":"Bell_numbers_subset_partial_order.svg.png.webp"}
