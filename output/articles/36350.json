{"title":"Province","summary":"A province is almost always an administrative division within a country or state. The term derives from the ancient Roman provincia, which was the major territorial and administrative unit of the Roman Empire's territorial possessions outside Italy. The term province has since been adopted by many countries. In some countries with no actual provinces, \"the provinces\" is a metaphorical term meaning \"outside the capital city\".","image":"The_Roman_Empire_ca_400_AD.png.webp"}
