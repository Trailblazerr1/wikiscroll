{"title":"Kurdish alphabets","summary":"The Kurdish languages are written in either of two alphabets:  a Latin alphabet introduced by Celadet Al√Æ Bedirxan in 1932 called the Bedirxan alphabet or Hawar alphabet (after the Hawar magazine) and a Perso-Arabic script called the Sorani alphabet or Central Kurdish alphabet. The Kurdistan Region has agreed upon a standard for Central Kurdish, implemented in Unicode for computation purposes.[1]","image":"Kurdish_Food_-_Alder_Street_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1717250.jpg.webp"}
