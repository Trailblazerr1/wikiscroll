{"title":"Frigatebird","summary":"Frigatebirds (also listed as \"frigate bird\", \"frigate-bird\", \"frigate\", \"frigate-petrel\")[1] are a family of seabirds called Fregatidae which are found across all tropical and subtropical oceans. The five extant species are classified in a single genus, Fregata. All have predominantly black plumage, long, deeply forked tails and long hooked bills. Females have white underbellies and males have a distinctive red gular pouch, which they inflate during the breeding season to attract females. Their wings are long and pointed and can span up to 2.3 metres (7.5Â ft), the largest wing area to body weight ratio of any bird.","image":"Male_Frigate_bird.jpg.webp","url":"Frigatebird"}
