{"title":"Positron","summary":"The positron or antielectron is the antiparticle or the antimatter counterpart of the electron. It has an electric charge of +1Â e, a spin of 1/2 (the same as the electron), and the same mass as an electron. When a positron collides with an electron, annihilation occurs. If this collision occurs at low energies, it results in the production of two or more photons.","image":"PositronDiscovery.png.webp"}
