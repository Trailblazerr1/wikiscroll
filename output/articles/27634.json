{"title":"Lunatic asylum","summary":"The lunatic asylum (alternatively mental asylum or insane asylum) was an early precursor of the modern psychiatric hospital. The Quakers in Philadelphia were the first in America to make an organized effort to care for the mentally ill. The newly opened Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia provided rooms in the basement complete with shackles attached to the walls to house a small number of mentally ill patients (National Institutes of Health, 2013).","image":"Francisco_Goya_-_Casa_de_locos.jpg.webp"}
