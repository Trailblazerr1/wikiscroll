{"title":"Hand axe","summary":"A hand axe (or handaxe or  Acheulean hand axe) is a prehistoric stone tool with two faces that is the longest-used tool in human history, yet there is no academic consensus on what they were used for.[1] It is usually made from flint or chert. It is characteristic of the lower Acheulean and middle Palaeolithic (Mousterian) periods, roughly 1.6 million years ago to about 100,000 years ago, and used by homo erectus and other early humans, but rarely homo sapiens[2] Its technical name (biface) comes from the fact that the archetypical model is a generally bifacial and almond-shaped (amygdaloidal) lithic flake. Hand axes tend to be symmetrical along their longitudinal axis and formed by pressure or percussion. The most common hand axes have a pointed end and rounded base, which gives them their characteristic almond shape, and both faces have been knapped to remove the natural cortex, at least partially. Hand axes are a type of the somewhat wider biface group of two-faced tools or weapons.","image":"Handaxe_by_John_Frere.png.webp","url":"Hand_axe"}
