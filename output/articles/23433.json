{"title":"Jimmy Connors","summary":"James Scott Connors (born September 2, 1952)[2] is an American former world No. 1 tennis player. He held the top Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking for a then-record 160 consecutive weeks from 1974 to 1977 and a career total of 268 weeks. By virtue of his long and prolific career, Connors still holds three prominent Open Era men's singles records: 109 titles, 1,557 matches played, and 1,274 match wins. His titles include eight major singles titles (a joint Open Era record five US Opens, two Wimbledons, one Australian Open), three year-end championships, and 17 Grand Prix Super Series titles. In 1974, he became the second man in the Open Era to win three major titles in a calendar year, and was not permitted to participate in the fourth, the French Open. In 1982, he won both Wimbledon and the US Open and is considered to be the unofficial No. 1 player for that year, in addition to 1974 and 1976. He retired in 1996 at the age of 43.","image":"Jimmy_Conners_1994.jpg.webp","url":"Jimmy_Connors"}
