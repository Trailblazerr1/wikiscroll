{"title":"Orc","summary":"An orc (or ork) /ɔːrk/[1] is a fictional humanoid monster like a goblin. Orcs were brought into modern usage by the fantasy writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, especially The Lord of the Rings. In Tolkien's works, orcs are a brutish, aggressive, ugly and malevolent race of monsters, contrasting with the benevolent Elves and serving an evil power, though they share a human sense of morality; there is a suggestion, among several somewhat contradictory origin stories, that they are a corrupted race of elves.[2]","image":"Orc_mask_by_GrimZombie.jpg.webp","url":"Orc"}
