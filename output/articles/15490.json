{"title":"Executive Order 13769","summary":"Executive Order 13769, titled Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States, labeled the \"Muslim ban\" by critics,[1][2]  or commonly referred to as the Trump travel ban, was a controversial executive order by US President Donald Trump. Except for the extent to which it was blocked by various courts, it was in effect from January 27, 2017, until March 6, 2017, when it was superseded by Executive Order 13780. Executive Order 13769 lowered the number of refugees to be admitted into the United States in 2017 to 50,000, suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days, suspended the entry of Syrian refugees indefinitely, directed some cabinet secretaries to suspend entry of those whose countries do not meet adjudication standards under U.S. immigration law for 90 days, and included exceptions on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) listed these countries as Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.[3] More than 700 travelers were detained, and up to 60,000 visas were \"provisionally revoked\".[4]","image":"Seal_of_the_President_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp","url":"Executive_Order_13769"}
