{"title":"Yūrei","summary":"Yūrei (幽霊) are figures in Japanese folklore analogous to the Western model of ghosts. The name consists of two kanji, 幽 (yū), meaning \"faint\" or \"dim\" and 霊 (rei), meaning \"soul\" or \"spirit\". Alternative names include 亡霊 (Bōrei), meaning ruined or departed spirit, 死霊 (Shiryō) meaning dead spirit, or the more encompassing 妖怪 (Yōkai) or お化け (Obake). Like their Chinese and Western counterparts, they are thought to be spirits barred from a peaceful afterlife.","image":"Amaterasu_cave_wide.jpg.webp"}
