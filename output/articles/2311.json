{"title":"Affirmation and negation","summary":"In linguistics and grammar, affirmation and negation (abbreviated respectively AFF and NEG) are the ways that grammar encodes positive and negative polarity in verb phrases, clauses, or other utterances. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or truth of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the sentences \"Jane is here\" and \"Jane is not here\"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
