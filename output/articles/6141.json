{"title":"Bell","summary":"A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument. Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator. The strike may be made by an internal \"clapper\" or \"uvula\", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell).","image":"Parts_of_a_Bell.svg.png.webp"}
