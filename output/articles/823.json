{"title":"3,000 strikeout club","summary":"In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 3,000 strikeout club is the group of 19 pitchers who have struck out 3,000 or more batters in their careers. Walter Johnson became the first member in 1923, and was the only one until Bob Gibson joined in 1974. The most recent addition is Max Scherzer, who joined on September 12, 2021. The group includes three left-handed pitchers: CC Sabathia, Steve Carlton and Randy Johnson.[1][2] Johnson reached the mark with the fewest games pitched and innings pitched.[3] César Gerónimo is the only player struck out by two pitchers for their 3,000th strikeout: Gibson in 1974 and Nolan Ryan in 1980.[4] The Minnesota Twins were the first of four franchises to see multiple pitchers record their 3,000th strikeout: Walter Johnson (while the franchise was called the Washington Senators) in 1923 and Bert Blyleven in 1986. The other teams with multiple members are the Chicago Cubs (Ferguson Jenkins and Greg Maddux), the New York Yankees (Phil Niekro and Sabathia), and the Houston Astros (Ryan and Justin Verlander). Ten 3,000-strikeout pitchers are also members of the 300-win club.[5]  Seven members were named to the All-Century Team, a list of MLB's best 100 players; fans later elected four of them as starters.[6][7]","image":"Nolan_Ryan_in_Atlanta_close-up.jpg.webp"}
