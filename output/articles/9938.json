{"title":"Chromecast","summary":"Chromecast is a line of digital media players developed by Google. The devices, designed as small dongles, can play Internet-streamed audio-visual content on a high-definition television or home audio system. The user controls playback with a mobile device or personal computer through mobile and web apps that support the Google Cast protocol, or by issuing commands via Google Assistant. Alternatively, content can be mirrored from the Google Chrome web browser on a personal computer or from the screen of some Android devices.","image":"Google_Chromecast_wordmark.svg.png.webp","url":"Chromecast"}
