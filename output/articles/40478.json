{"title":"Shogun","summary":"Shogun (将軍, shōgun, Japanese: [ɕoːɡɯɴ] (listen); English: /ˈʃoʊɡʌn/ SHOH-gun[1]), officially Sei-i Taishōgun (征夷大将軍, \"Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\"),[2] was the title of the military dictators of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868. Nominally appointed by the Emperor, shoguns were usually the de facto rulers of the country,[3] though during part of the Kamakura period, shoguns were themselves figureheads. The office of shogun was in practice hereditary, though over the course of the history of Japan several different clans held the position. The title was originally held by military commanders during Heian period in the 8th and 9th centuries; when Minamoto no Yoritomo gained political ascendency over Japan in 1185, the title was revived to regularize his position, making him the first shogun in the usually understood sense.","image":"KaiIchiranzu1806.jpg.webp","url":"Shogun"}
