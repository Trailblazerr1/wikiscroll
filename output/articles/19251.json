{"title":"György Lukács","summary":"György Lukács[lower-alpha 1] (born György Bernát Löwinger;[lower-alpha 2] Hungarian: szegedi Lukács György Bernát; German: Georg Bernard Baron Lukács von Szegedin;[lower-alpha 3] 13 April 1885 – 4 June 1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher, literary historian, critic, and aesthetician.[6] He was one of the founders of Western Marxism, an interpretive tradition that departed from the Marxist ideological orthodoxy of the Soviet Union. He developed the theory of reification, and contributed to Marxist theory with developments of Karl Marx's theory of class consciousness. He was also a philosopher of Leninism. He ideologically developed and organised Lenin's pragmatic revolutionary practices into the formal philosophy of vanguard-party revolution.","image":"Lukács_György.jpg.webp","url":"György_Lukács"}
