{"title":"Market town","summary":"A market town is a European settlement that obtained by custom or royal charter, in the Middle Ages, a market right, which allowed it to host a regular market; this distinguished it from a village or city. In Britain, small rural towns with a hinterland of villages are still commonly called market towns, as sometimes reflected in their names (e.g. Downham Market, Market Rasen, or Market Drayton).","image":"Shrewsbury_Market_square_-_panoramio.jpg.webp","url":"Market_town"}
