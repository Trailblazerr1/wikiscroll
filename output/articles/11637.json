{"title":"CubeSat","summary":"A CubeSat (U-class spacecraft)[1] is a type of miniaturized satellite for space research that is made up of multiple cubic modules of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm size.[2] CubeSats have a mass of no more than 1.33 kilograms (2.9 lb) per unit,[3] and often use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their electronics and structure. CubeSats are put into orbit by deployers on the International Space Station, or launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle.[4] As of August 2021, more than 1600 CubeSats have been launched and more than 90 have been destroyed in launch failures.[5]","image":"Ncube2.jpg.webp"}
