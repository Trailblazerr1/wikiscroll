{"title":"Rotation period","summary":"The rotation period of a celestial object (e.g., star, gas giant, planet, moon, asteroid) is as its sidereal rotation period i.e. the time that the object takes to complete a single revolution around its axis of rotation relative to the background stars, measured in sidereal time. This type of rotation period differs from the object's synodic rotation period (a solar day), measured in solar time, which may differ by a fractional or multiple rotation to accommodate the portion of the object's orbital period during one day.","image":"Eros_rotation_Dec._3-4_2000.gif"}
