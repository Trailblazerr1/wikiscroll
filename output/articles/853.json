{"title":"400-series highways","summary":"The 400-series highways are a network of controlled-access highways throughout the southern portion of the Canadian province of Ontario, forming a special subset of the provincial highway system. They are analogous to the Interstate Highway System in the United States or the Autoroute system of neighbouring Quebec, and are regulated by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO). The 400-series designations were introduced in 1952, although Ontario had been constructing divided highways for two decades prior. Initially, only HighwaysÂ 400, 401 and 402 were numbered; other designations followed in the subsequent decades.","image":"Ontario_403.svg.png.webp"}
