{"title":"Yakov Dzhugashvili","summary":"Yakov Iosifovich Dzhugashvili[lower-alpha 1] (31 March [O.S. 18 March] 1907 – 14 April 1943) was the eldest of Joseph Stalin's three legitimate children, the son of Stalin's first wife, Kato Svanidze, who died nine months after his birth. His father, then a young revolutionary in his mid-20s, left the child to be raised by his late wife's family. In 1921, when Dzhugashvili had reached the age of fourteen, he was brought to Moscow, where his father had become a leading figure in the Bolshevik government, eventually becoming head of the Soviet Union. Disregarded by Stalin, Dzhugashvili was a shy, quiet child who appeared unhappy and tried to commit suicide several times as a youth. Married twice, Dzhugashvili had three children, two of whom reached adulthood.","image":"Джугашвили_Яков_Иосифович.jpg.webp","url":"Yakov_Dzhugashvili"}
