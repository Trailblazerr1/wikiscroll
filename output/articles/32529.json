{"title":"Nude (art)","summary":"The nude, as a form of visual art that focuses on the unclothed human figure, is an enduring tradition in Western art.[2] It was a preoccupation of Ancient Greek art, and after a semi-dormant period in the Middle Ages returned to a central position with the Renaissance. Unclothed figures often also play a part in other types of art, such as history painting, including allegorical and religious art, portraiture, or the decorative arts.  From prehistory to the earliest civilizations, nude female figures are generally understood to be symbols of fertility or well-being.[3]","image":"David_von_Michelangelo.jpg.webp"}
