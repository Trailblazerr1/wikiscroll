{"title":"Freedom of religion in Saudi Arabia","summary":"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an Islamic absolute monarchy in which Sunni Islam is the official state religion based on firm Sharia law. Non-Muslims must practice their religion in private and are vulnerable to discrimination and deportation.[1]  It has been stated that no law requires all citizens to be Muslim,[1] but also that non-Muslims are not allowed to have Saudi citizenship.[2] Children born to Muslim fathers are by law deemed Muslim, and conversion from Islam to another religion is considered apostasy and punishable by death.[1] Blasphemy against Sunni Islam is also punishable by death, but the more common penalty is a long prison sentence.[1] According to the U.S. Department of State's 2013 Report on International Religious Freedom, there have been 'no confirmed reports of executions for either apostasy or blasphemy' between 1913 and 2013.[1]","image":"Emblem_of_Saudi_Arabia_(2).svg.png.webp"}
