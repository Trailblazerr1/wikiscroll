{"title":"Habsburg Monarchy","summary":"Habsburg Monarchy (German: Habsburgermonarchie), or Danubian Monarchy (German: Donaumonarchie), or Habsburg Empire (German: Habsburgerreich) is a modern umbrella term coined by historians to denote the numerous lands and kingdoms of the Habsburg dynasty, especially for those of the Austrian line. Although from 1438 to 1806 (with the exception of 1742 to 1745), a member of the House of Habsburg was also Holy Roman Emperor, the Holy Roman Empire itself (over which the emperor exercised only very limited authority) is not considered to have been part of what is now called the Habsburg Monarchy.","image":"Banner_of_the_Holy_Roman_Emperor_(after_1400).svg.png.webp","url":"Habsburg_Monarchy"}
