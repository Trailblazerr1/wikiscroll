{"title":"1994 FIFA World Cup","summary":"The 1994 FIFA World Cup was the 15th FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national soccer teams. It was hosted by the United States and took place from June 17 to July 17, 1994, at nine venues across the country. The United States was chosen as the host by FIFA on July 4, 1988. Despite soccer's relative lack of popularity in the host nation, the tournament was the most financially successful[1][2] in World Cup history; it broke tournament records with overall attendance of 3,587,538 and an average of 68,991 per game,[3] marks that stood unbroken as of 2018[4] despite the expansion of the competition from 24 to 32 teams starting with the 1998 World Cup.[5]","image":"1994_FIFA_World_Cup.svg.png.webp"}
