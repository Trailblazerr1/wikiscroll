{"title":"Differential form","summary":"In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and tensor calculus, differential forms are an approach to multivariable calculus that is independent of coordinates.  Differential forms provide a unified approach to define integrands over curves, surfaces, solids, and higher-dimensional manifolds.  The modern notion of differential forms was pioneered by Ã‰lie Cartan.  It has many applications, especially in geometry, topology and physics.","image":"249ee3fdbced31dfc328ff357f67bb134ca66b8d.svg"}
