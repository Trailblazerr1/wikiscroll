{"title":"Low-noise block downconverter","summary":"A low-noise block downconverter (LNB) is the receiving device mounted on satellite dishes used for satellite TV reception, which collects the radio waves from the dish and converts them to a signal which is sent through a cable to the receiver inside the building.  Also called a low-noise block,[1][2] low-noise converter (LNC), or even low-noise downconverter (LND),[3] the device is sometimes inaccurately called a low-noise amplifier (LNA).[4]","image":"Maszt_radiowy_w_Konstantynowie.jpg.webp"}
