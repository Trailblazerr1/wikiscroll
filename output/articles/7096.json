{"title":"Body dysmorphic disorder","summary":"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), occasionally still called dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder characterized by the obsessive idea that some aspect of one's own body part or appearance is severely flawed and therefore warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix it.[1]  In BDD's delusional variant, the flaw is imagined.[2]  If the flaw is actual, its importance is severely exaggerated.[2]  Either way, thoughts about it are pervasive and intrusive, and may occupy several hours a day, causing severe distress and impairing one's otherwise normal activities. BDD is classified as a somatoform disorder, and the DSM-5 categorizes BDD in the obsessiveâ€“compulsive spectrum, and distinguishes it from anorexia nervosa.","image":"Is_this_me_mental_disorder_of_looking.jpg.webp"}
