{"title":"Chữ Nôm","summary":"Chữ Nôm (𡨸喃, IPA: [cɨ̌ˀ nom], literally 'Southern characters')[4] is a logographic writing system formerly used to write the Vietnamese language. It uses Chinese characters to represent Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary and some native Vietnamese words, with other words represented by new characters created using a variety of methods, including phono-semantic compounds.[5] This composite script was therefore highly complex, and was accessible only to the small proportion of the population who had mastered written Chinese.[6]","image":"Chu_nom.svg.png.webp","url":"Chữ_Nôm"}
