{"title":"Quest","summary":"A quest is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a plot device in mythology and fiction: a difficult journey towards a goal, often symbolic or allegorical.  Tales of quests figure prominently in the folklore of every nation[1] and ethnic culture.  In literature, the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the hero, who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).[2]  The object of a quest may also have supernatural properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The moral of a quest tale often centers on the changed character of the hero.","image":"Theodor_Kittelsen%2C_Soria_Moria.jpg.webp"}
