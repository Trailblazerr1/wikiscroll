A sub-mediterranean climate reaches to the northern extensions of the Dinaric Alps that traverse the country in a northwest–southeast direction. The Julian Alps in the northwest have an alpine climate.[22] Continental climate is increasingly more pronounced towards the Pannonian Plain in the Northwest. The nation's capital and largest city—Ljubljana—is situated at roughly the centre of the country.[23]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
