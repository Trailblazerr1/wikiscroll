{"title":"Pressure cooking","summary":"Pressure cooking is the process of cooking food under high pressure steam, employing water or a water-based cooking liquid, in a sealed vessel known as a pressure cooker. High pressure limits boiling, and permits cooking temperatures well above 100 °C (212 °F) to be reached. Pressures up to one atmosphere above STP are generally employed.","image":"Pressure_cooker.jpg.webp","url":"Pressure_cooking"}
