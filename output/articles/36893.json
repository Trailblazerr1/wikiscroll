{"title":"Race and ethnicity in the United States","summary":"The United States of America has a racially and ethnically diverse population.[1] At the federal level, race and ethnicity have been categorized separately. The most recent United States Census officially recognized five racial categories (White, Black or African American, Asian American, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) as well as people of two or more races.[2][3][4] The Census Bureau also classified respondents as \"Hispanic or Latino\" or \"Not Hispanic or Latino\", identifying Hispanic and Latino as an ethnicity (not a race), which comprises the largest minority group in the nation.[2][3][5] The Census also asked an \"Ancestry Question,\" which covers the broader notion of ethnicity, in the 2000 Census long form and the 2010 American Community Survey; the question worded differently on “origins” will return in the 2020 Census.[6]","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp","url":"Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States"}
