{"title":"Diaspora","summary":"A diaspora (/daɪˈæspərə/ dye-AS-pər-ə) is a scattered population whose origin lies in a separate geographic locale.[2][3] Historically, the word diaspora was used to refer to the mass dispersion of a population from its indigenous territories, specifically the dispersion of Jews.[4] Whilst the word was originally used to describe the forced displacement of certain peoples, \"diasporas\" is now generally used to describe those who identify with a \"homeland\", but live outside of it.[5][6][7]","image":"Piñata.jpg.webp"}
