{"title":"Antemoro people","summary":"The Antemoro (or Antaimoro) are an ethnic group of Madagascar living on the southeastern coast, mostly between Manakara and Farafangana. Numbering around 500,000, this ethnic group traces its origins back to settlers who arrived from Somalia[1][2] in the 15th or 16th century. Upon arriving in Madagascar, these settlers converted the Antemoro to Islam; the religion was soon abandoned in favor of traditional beliefs and practices associated with respect for the ancestors, although remnants of Islam remain in fady such as the prohibition against consuming pork. In the 16th century an Antemoro kingdom was established, supplanting the power of the earlier Zafiraminia, who also descended from seafarers.","image":"Ethnic_groups_of_Madagascar_Map.png.webp"}
