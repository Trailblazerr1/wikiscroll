{"title":"Hack Wilson","summary":"Lewis Robert \"Hack\" Wilson (April 26, 1900 â€“ November 23, 1948) was an American Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies.[1]  Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s.[2]  His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \"For a brief span of a few years\", wrote a sportswriter of the day, \"this hammered down little strongman actually rivaled the mighty Ruth.\"[3]","image":"Hack_Wilson_Goudey_card.jpg.webp"}
