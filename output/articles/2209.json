{"title":"Admiral Ackbar","summary":"Fleet Admiral Gial  Ackbar is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. A member of the amphibious Mon Calamari species, Ackbar was the foremost military commander of the Rebel Alliance, and led the attack against the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi (1983), the final entry in the original Star Wars trilogy. Ackbar plays an important role in the film, as without his tactical genius, the Rebel Alliance would have been obliterated. Although his time in the film was brief, Ackbar became a prominent character in other Star Wars media, including novels, comic books, video games, and television shows, and later made appearances in the sequel trilogy films Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), and the television series The Clone Wars.","image":"AckbarStanding.jpg.webp"}
