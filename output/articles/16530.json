{"title":"Flugelhorn","summary":"The flugelhorn (/ˈfluːɡəlhɔːrn/), also spelled fluegelhorn, flugel horn, or flügelhorn, is a brass instrument that resembles the trumpet and cornet but has a wider, more conical bore.[1] Like trumpets and cornets, most flugelhorns are pitched in B♭ (some are in C).[2] It is a type of valved bugle, developed in Germany in the early 19th century from a traditional English valveless bugle. The first version of a valved bugle was sold by Heinrich Stölzel in Berlin in 1828.[3] The valved bugle provided Adolphe Sax (creator of the saxophone) with the inspiration for his B♭ soprano (contralto) saxhorns, on which the modern-day flugelhorn is modeled.[4][5]","image":"Yamaha_Flugelhorn_YFH-8310Z.jpg.webp","url":"Flugelhorn"}
