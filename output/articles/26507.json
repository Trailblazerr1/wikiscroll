{"title":"List of Major League Baseball annual home run leaders","summary":"In baseball, a home run is scored when the ball is hit so far that the batter is able to circle all the bases ending at home plate, scoring himself plus any runners already on base, with no errors by the defensive team on the play. An automatic home run is achieved by hitting the ball on the fly over the outfield fence in fair territory.  More rarely, an inside-the-park home run occurs when the hitter reaches home plate while the baseball remains in play on the field.[1] In Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league[L] wins the home run title each season by hitting the most home runs that year.[2] Only home runs hit in a particular league count towards that league's seasonal lead. Mark McGwire, for example, hit 58 home runs in 1997, more than any other player that year.[3][4] However, McGwire was traded from the American League's (AL) Oakland Athletics to the National League's (NL) St. Louis Cardinals midway through the season[3] and his individual AL and NL home run totals (34 and 24, respectively) did not qualify to lead either league.[5][6]","image":"20060825_Barry_Bonds_follow_through.jpg.webp"}
