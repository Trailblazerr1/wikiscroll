{"title":"Gorgias","summary":"Gorgias[lower-alpha 1] (483â€“375 BC)[2] was an ancient Greek sophist, pre-Socratic philosopher, and rhetorician who was a native of Leontinoi in Sicily. Along with Protagoras, he forms the first generation of Sophists. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. \"Like other Sophists, he was an itinerant that practiced in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to ask miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.\"[3] He has been called \"Gorgias the Nihilist\" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.[4][5][6][7]","image":"Mediterranean_Sea_location_map.svg.png.webp"}
