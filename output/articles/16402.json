{"title":"Flag of Spain","summary":"The flag of Spain (Spanish: Bandera de Espa√±a), as it is defined in the Constitution of 1978, consists of three horizontal stripes: red, yellow and red, the yellow stripe being twice the size of each red stripe. Traditionally, the middle stripe was defined by the more archaic term of gualda, and hence the popular name la Rojigualda (red-weld).","image":"Flag_of_Spain.svg.png.webp"}
