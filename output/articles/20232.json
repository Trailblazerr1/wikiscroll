{"title":"Heteroscedasticity","summary":"In statistics, a vector of random variables is heteroscedastic (or heteroskedastic;[lower-alpha 1] from Ancient Greek hetero \"different\" and skedasis \"dispersion\") if the variability of the random disturbance is different across elements of the vector.  Here, variability could be quantified by the variance or any other measure of statistical dispersion. Thus heteroscedasticity is the absence of homoscedasticity. A typical example is the set of observations of income in different cities.","image":"Heteroscedasticity.png.webp","url":"Heteroscedasticity"}
