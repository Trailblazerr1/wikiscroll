{"title":"The Brady Bunch","summary":"The Brady Bunch is an American sitcom created by Sherwood Schwartz that aired from September 26, 1969, to March 8, 1974, on ABC. The series revolves around a large blended family with six children. Considered one of the last old-style family sitcoms, the show aired for five seasons and, after its cancellation in 1974, went into syndication in September 1975.[3] Neither a hit nor a critical success during its original run, the program has since become a popular syndicated staple, especially among children and teenage viewers.","image":"BradyBunchtitle.png.webp"}
