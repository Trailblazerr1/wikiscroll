{"title":"Bronze","summary":"Bronze is an alloy consisting primarily of copper, commonly with about 12â€“12.5% tin and often with the addition of other metals (such as aluminum, manganese, nickel or zinc) and sometimes non-metals or metalloids such as arsenic, phosphorus or silicon. These additions produce a range of alloys that may be harder than copper alone, or have other useful properties, such as strength, ductility, or machinability.","image":"Bull's_head_ornament_for_a_lyre_MET_DP260070.jpg.webp"}
