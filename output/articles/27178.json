{"title":"Local government in Wales","summary":"Since 1 April 1996, Wales has been divided into 22 single-tier principal areas (Welsh: Awdurdodau unedol) for local government purposes.[1] The elected councils of these areas are responsible for the provision of all local government services, including education, social work, environmental protection, and most highways. Below these there are also (in most, but not all, parts of the principal areas) elected community councils to which responsibility for specific aspects of the application of local policy may be devolved. The last set of local elections in Wales took place in 2017, with the next due to take place in 2022.","image":"Wales_Principal_Areas_Map.svg.png.webp"}
