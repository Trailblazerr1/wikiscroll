{"title":"Fold (geology)","summary":"In structural geology, a fold is a stack of originally planar surfaces, such as sedimentary strata, that are bent or curved during permanent deformation.  Folds in rocks vary in size from microscopic crinkles to mountain-sized folds. They occur as single isolated folds or in periodic sets (known as fold trains). Synsedimentary folds are those formed during sedimentary deposition.","image":"Folding_of_alternate_layers_of_limestone_layers_with_chert_layers.jpg.webp","url":"Fold_(geology)"}
