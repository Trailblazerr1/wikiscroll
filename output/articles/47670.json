{"title":"Vlasov equation","summary":"The Vlasov equation is a differential equation describing time evolution of the distribution function of plasma consisting of charged particles with long-range interaction, e.g. Coulomb. The equation was first suggested for description of plasma by Anatoly Vlasov in 1938[1][2] and later discussed by him in detail in a monograph.[3]","image":"afac10b76e6189b69b37b8237836722de2e389db.svg","url":"Vlasov_equation"}
