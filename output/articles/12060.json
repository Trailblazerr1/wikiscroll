{"title":"Danish krone","summary":"The krone (Danish pronunciation: [ˈkʰʁoːnə]; plural: kroner; sign: kr.; code: DKK) is the official currency of Denmark, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands, introduced on 1 January 1875.[3] Both the ISO code \"DKK\" and currency sign \"kr.\" are in common use; the former precedes the value, the latter in some contexts follows it. The currency is sometimes referred to as the Danish crown in English, since krone literally means crown. Historically, krone coins have been minted in Denmark since the 17th century.","image":"DKK_100_obverse_(2009).jpg.webp","url":"Danish_krone"}
