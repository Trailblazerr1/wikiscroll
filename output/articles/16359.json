{"title":"Flag of Belgium","summary":"The flag of Belgium (Dutch: Vlag van BelgiÃ«, French: Drapeau belge, German: Flagge Belgiens) is a tricolour consisting of three equal vertical bands displaying the national colours of Belgium: black, yellow, and red. The colours were taken from the coat of arms of the Duchy of Brabant, and the vertical design may be based on the flag of France. When flown, the black band is nearest the pole (at the hoist side). It has the unusual proportions of 13:15.","image":"Flag_of_Belgium.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Belgium"}
