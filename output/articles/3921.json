{"title":"Anti-communism","summary":"Anti-communism is political and ideological opposition to communism. Organized anti-communism developed after the 1917 October Revolution in Russia and it reached global dimensions during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in an intense rivalry. Anti-communism has been an element of movements which hold many different political positions, including conservatism, fascism, liberalism, nationalism, social democracy, libertarianism, and leftism. Anti-communism has also been expressed in philosophy, by several religious groups, and in literature. Some well-known proponents of anti-communism claim to be former communists. Anti-communism has also been prominent among movements resisting Communist governance.","image":"Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg.png.webp","url":"Anti-communism"}
