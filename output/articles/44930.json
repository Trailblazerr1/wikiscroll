{"title":"Third Temple","summary":"The Third Temple (Hebrew: בית המקדש השלישי‎, romanized: Beit haMikdash haShlishi, lit. 'The House, the Holy, the Third') is used in reference to a hypothetical rebuilt third Temple in Jerusalem, which would succeed both the original Solomon's Temple (built under Solomon and destroyed in 587 BCE by the Neo-Babylonians) and the Second Temple (built under the Achaemenid Persian Empire and destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans). Although it remains unbuilt, the notion of and desire for a Third Temple in Jerusalem is sacred in Judaism, particularly Orthodox Judaism, and is anticipated as a place of worship. The prophets in the Hebrew Bible called for its construction to be fulfilled prior to, or in tandem with, the Messianic Age. The rebuilding of a Third Temple also plays a major role in some interpretations of Christian eschatology.","image":"Francesco_Hayez_017.jpg.webp","url":"Third_Temple"}
