{"title":"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud","summary":"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a part of Amazon.com's cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), that allows users to rent virtual computers on which to run their own computer applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications by providing a web service through which a user can boot an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to configure a virtual machine, which Amazon calls an \"instance\", containing any software desired. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the second for active servers – hence the term \"elastic\". EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimization and high levels of redundancy.[2] In November 2010, Amazon switched its own retail website platform to EC2 and AWS.[3]","image":"AWS_Simple_Icons_Compute_Amazon_EC2_Instances.svg.png.webp","url":"Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud"}
