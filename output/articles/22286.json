{"title":"Interslavic","summary":"Interslavic (Medžuslovjansky / Меджусловјанскы) is a pan-Slavic auxiliary language. Its purpose is to facilitate communication between representatives of different Slavic nations, as well as to allow people who do not know any Slavic language to communicate with Slavs by being understandable to most, if not all Slavic speakers without them having to learn the language themselves. For Slavs and non-Slavs it can fulfill an educational role as well.","image":"Flag_of_Interslavic.svg.png.webp","url":"Interslavic"}
