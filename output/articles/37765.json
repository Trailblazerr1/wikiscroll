{"title":"Revolution (Beatles song)","summary":"\"Revolution\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennonâ€“McCartney partnership. Three versions of the song were recorded and released in 1968, all during sessions for the Beatles' self-titled double album, also known as \"the White Album\":  a slow, bluesy arrangement (titled \"Revolution 1\") that would make the final cut for the LP; an abstract sound collage (titled \"Revolution 9\") that originated as the latter part of \"Revolution 1\" and appears on the same album; and the faster, hard rock version similar to \"Revolution 1\", released as the B-side of \"Hey Jude\". Although the single version was issued first, it was recorded several weeks after \"Revolution 1\", as a remake specifically intended for release as a single.","image":"Revolution1968.png.webp","url":"Revolution_(Beatles_song)"}
