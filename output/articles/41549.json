{"title":"Soy milk","summary":"Soya milk (simplified Chinese: 豆浆; traditional Chinese: 豆漿) also known as soy milk or soymilk, is a plant-based drink produced by soaking and grinding soybeans, boiling the mixture, and filtering out remaining particulates. It is a stable emulsion of oil, water, and protein. Its original form is an intermediate product of the manufacture of tofu. Originating in China, it became a common beverage in Europe and North America in the latter half of the 20th century, especially as production techniques were developed to give it a taste and consistency more closely resembling that of dairy milk. Soya milk may be used as a substitute for dairy milk by individuals who are vegan or are lactose intolerant.","image":"Soy_milk.jpg.webp","url":"Soy_milk"}
