{"title":"Akrotiri and Dhekelia","summary":"The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia[2] (SBA)[lower-alpha 1] is a British Overseas Territory on the island of Cyprus. The areas, which include British military bases and installations, as well as other land, were retained by the British under the 1960 treaty of independence, signed by the United Kingdom, Greece, Turkey and representatives from the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, which granted independence to the (then) Crown colony of Cyprus. The territory serves an important role as a station for signals intelligence and provides a vital strategic part of the United Kingdom surveillance gathering network in the Mediterranean and the Middle East.[3][4]","image":"Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png.webp","url":"Akrotiri_and_Dhekelia"}
