{"title":"Cassava","summary":"Manihot esculenta, commonly called cassava (/kəˈsɑːvə/), manioc,[2] or yuca (among numerous regional names) is a woody shrub  of the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae, native to South America. Although a perennial plant, cassava is extensively cultivated as an annual crop in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates. Though it is often called yuca in parts of Spanish America and in the United States, it is not related to yucca, a shrub in the family Asparagaceae. Cassava is predominantly consumed in boiled form, but substantial quantities are used to extract cassava starch, called tapioca, which is used for food, animal feed, and industrial purposes. The Brazilian farinha, and the related garri of West Africa, is an edible coarse flour obtained by grating cassava roots, pressing moisture off the obtained grated pulp, and finally drying it (and roasting both in the case of farinha and garri).","image":"Manihot_esculenta_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-090.jpg.webp"}
