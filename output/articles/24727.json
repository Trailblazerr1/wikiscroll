{"title":"Kid Cudi","summary":"Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi (born January 30, 1984), better known by his stage name Kid Cudi (/ˈkʌdi/ KUDD-ee; often stylized as KiD CuDi), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He has widely been recognized as an influence on several contemporary hip hop and alternative acts.[2][3][4] His music is often autobiographical, telling of his childhood hardships dealing with depression, loneliness and alienation, his struggle with alcohol and drugs into adulthood, as well as themes of heartbreak, dissipation and celebration. Cudi began to gain major recognition following the release of his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled A Kid Named Cudi (2008), which caught the attention of American musician Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint by late 2008.","image":"Kid_Cudi_2010_2_(crop).jpg.webp","url":"Kid_Cudi"}
