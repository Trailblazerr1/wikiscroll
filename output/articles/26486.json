{"title":"List of Israel international footballers","summary":"The Israel national football team has represented Israel in international association football since 1934, when it played its first official game (as Mandatory Palestine or Eretz Israelâ€”\"Land of Israel\") against Egypt.[1] It is fielded by the Israel Football Association (IFA), which has governed football in the country since 1928,[2] and has borne its present name since the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948. Israel competed as a member of the Asian Football Confederation from 1956 until 1974, when it was expelled for political reasons;[2] it then played without formal affiliation to any regional bloc for two decades. In 1994 the IFA was made a full member of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), enabling the inclusion of Israeli teams in UEFA competitions.[2]","image":"Israel_soccer_1956.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Israel_international_footballers"}
