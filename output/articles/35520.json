{"title":"Pope John Paul I","summary":"Pope John Paul I (Latin: Ioannes Paulus I; Italian: Giovanni Paolo I; born Albino Luciani [alˈbiːno luˈtʃaːni]; 17 October 1912 – 28 September 1978) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City from 26 August 1978 to his death 33 days later.  He was the first pope born in the 20th century and the last one to die in the 20th century.  His reign is among the shortest in papal history, resulting in the most recent year of three popes and the first to occur since 1605. John Paul I remains the most recent Italian-born pope, the last in a succession of such popes that started with Clement VII in 1523.","image":"Ioannes_Paulus_I%2C_at_the_window%2C_1978_(retouched)_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
