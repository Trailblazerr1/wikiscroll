{"title":"Count Dracula","summary":"Count Dracula (/ˈdrækjʊlə, -jələ/) is the title character of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel Dracula. He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. Some aspects of the character are believed to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad the Impaler, who was also known as Dracula, and by Sir Henry Irving, an actor for whom Stoker was a personal assistant.[12]","image":"Bela_Lugosi_as_Dracula%2C_anonymous_photograph_from_1931%2C_Universal_Studios.jpg.webp","url":"Count_Dracula"}
