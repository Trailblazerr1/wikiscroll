{"title":"Bobby Charlton","summary":"Sir Robert Charlton CBE (born 11 October 1937) is an English former footballer who played as a midfielder. Considered one of the greatest players of all time,[2] he was a member of the England team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the year he also won the Ballon d'Or. He played almost all of his club football at Manchester United, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts, his passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot, as well as his fitness and stamina. He was cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a league match against Chelsea. His elder brother Jack, who was also in the World Cup-winning team, was a former defender for Leeds United and international manager.","image":"Bobby_Charlton_Portrait.jpg.webp"}
