{"title":"Crux","summary":"Crux (/kr åks/) is a constellation of the southern sky that is centred on four bright stars in a cross-shaped or kite-like asterism commonly known as the Southern Cross. It lies on the southern end of the Milky Way's visible band.  The name Crux is Latin for cross. Even though it is the smallest of all 88 modern constellations, Crux is among the most easily distinguished as its four main stars each have an apparent visual magnitude brighter than +2.8. It has attained a high level of cultural significance in many Southern Hemisphere states and nations.","image":"Crux_IAU.svg.png.webp"}
