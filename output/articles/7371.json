{"title":"Boxing Day","summary":"Boxing Day is a holiday celebrated the day after Christmas Day, occurring on the second day of Christmastide.[1] Though it originated as a holiday to give gifts to the poor, today Boxing Day is primarily known as a shopping holiday. It originated in the United Kingdom and is celebrated in a number of countries that previously formed part of the British Empire. Boxing Day is on 26 December, although the attached bank holiday or public holiday may take place either on that day or one or two days later (if necessary to ensure it falls on a weekday). Boxing Day is also concurrent with the Christian holiday Saint Stephen's Day.","image":"Eaton_Centre_Boxing_Day%2C_2019.jpg.webp","url":"Boxing_Day"}
