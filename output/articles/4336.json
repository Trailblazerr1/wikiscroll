{"title":"Arete","summary":"Arete (Greek: ἀρετή) is a concept in ancient Greek thought that, in its most basic sense, refers to \"excellence\" of any kind.[1] The term may also mean \"moral virtue\".[1] In its earliest appearance in Greek, this notion of excellence was ultimately bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential. The person of Arete is of the highest effectiveness; they use all of their faculties—strength, bravery, and wit—to achieve real results. In the Homeric world, Arete involves all of the abilities and potentialities available to humans.","image":"Arete_-_Areté-_Éfeso.jpg.webp"}
