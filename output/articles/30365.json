{"title":"Mongolian language","summary":"Mongolian[note 1] is the official language of Mongolia and both the most widely spoken and best-known member of the Mongolic language family. The number of speakers across all its dialects may be 5.2 million, including the vast majority of the residents of Mongolia and many of the ethnic Mongol residents of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China.[1] In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect is predominant, and is currently written in both Cyrillic and traditional Mongolian script (and at times in Latin for social networking). In Inner Mongolia, the language is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script.","image":"Flag_of_Mongolia.svg.png.webp","url":"Mongolian_language"}
