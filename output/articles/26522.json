{"title":"List of Maryland hurricanes (1950–present)","summary":"Since 1950, 142 known hurricanes, tropical storms and tropical depressions have affected the U.S. state of Maryland. Many of these storms also affect the country's capital, Washington, D.C., since the city is located on territory ceded by Maryland. Hurricanes are the most intense classification of these storms, while tropical storms and tropical depressions are generally weaker. The Delmarva Peninsula is often affected by cyclones   that brush the East Coast.[1] Central and Western Maryland, as well as Washington, D.C., commonly receive rainfall from the remnants of storms that make landfall elsewhere and track northward.[2] On rare occasions, the area experiences the effects of Pacific storms; one such example of this is Hurricane Tico, which made landfall on Mexico and moved inland.","image":"Hurricane_Isabel_18_sept_2003_1555Z.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Maryland_hurricanes_(1950–present)"}
