{"title":"Gymnosperm","summary":"The gymnosperms (pronunciation  lit. revealed seeds), also known as Acrogymnospermae, are a group of seed-producing plants that includes conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes, forming the clade Gymnospermae.  The term gymnosperm comes from the composite word in Greek: γυμνόσπερμος (γυμνός, gymnos, 'naked' and σπέρμα, sperma, 'seed'), literally meaning 'naked seeds'. The name is based on the unenclosed condition of their seeds (called ovules in their unfertilized state). The non-encased condition of their seeds contrasts with the seeds and ovules of flowering plants (angiosperms), which are enclosed within an ovary. Gymnosperm seeds develop either on the surface of scales or leaves, which are often modified to form cones, or solitary as in yew, Torreya, Ginkgo.[1] Gymnosperms show alternation of generations; and have a dominant diploid sporophytic phase, a reduced haploid gametophytic phase which is dependent on the sporophytic phase.","image":"Gymnospermae.jpg.webp","url":"Gymnosperm"}
