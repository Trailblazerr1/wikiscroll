{"title":"Mind uploading","summary":"Mind uploading, also known as whole brain emulation (WBE), is the theoretical futuristic process of scanning a physical structure of the brain accurately enough to create an emulation of the mental state (including long-term memory and \"self\") and transferring or copying it to a computer in a digital form. The computer would then run a simulation of the brain's information processing, such that it would respond in essentially the same way as the original brain and experience having a sentient conscious mind.[1][2][3]","image":"Unknown_engraver_-_Humani_Victus_Instrumenta_-_Ars_Coquinaria_-_WGA23954.jpg.webp","url":"Mind_uploading"}
