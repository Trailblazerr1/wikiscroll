{"title":"NBA salary cap","summary":"The NBA salary cap is the limit to the total amount of money that National Basketball Association teams are allowed to pay their players. Like many professional sports leagues, the NBA has a salary cap to control costs and benefit parity, defined by the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA). This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions and is calculated as a percentage of the league's revenue from the previous season. Under the CBA ratified in July 2017, the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues. For the 2019â€“20 season, the cap is set at $109.14 million.[1]","image":"58eb80993b8aac1547004b0192f04abb.png.webp","url":"NBA_salary_cap"}
