{"title":"Yemeni Revolution","summary":"The Yemeni Revolution (intifada),[18] also known as the Yemeni Revolution of Dignity[19] followed the initial stages of the Tunisian Revolution and occurred simultaneously with the Egyptian Revolution of 2011[20] and other Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa. In its early phase, protests in Yemen were initially against unemployment, economic conditions[2] and corruption,[1] as well as against the government's proposals to modify Yemen's constitution. The protesters' demands then escalated to calls for the resignation of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Mass defections from the military, as well as from Saleh's government, effectively rendered much of the country outside of the government's control, and protesters vowed to defy its authority.","image":"Yemen_protest.jpg.webp","url":"Yemeni_Revolution"}
