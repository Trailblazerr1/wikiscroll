{"title":"Massachusetts Turnpike","summary":"The Massachusetts Turnpike (colloquially \"Mass Pike\" or \"the Pike\"[3]) is a toll highway in the U.S. state of Massachusetts that is maintained by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). The turnpike begins at the New York state line in West Stockbridge, linking with the Berkshire Connector portion of the New York State Thruway. Spanning 138 miles (222 km) along an east–west axis, it is entirely concurrent with the portion of Interstate 90 (I-90) that lies within the state. The turnpike is the longest Interstate Highway in Massachusetts, while I-90 in full (which begins nationally in Seattle, Washington) is the longest Interstate Highway in the United States.","image":"Mass_Pike_shield.svg.png.webp"}
