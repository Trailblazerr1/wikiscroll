{"title":"2010s Haiti cholera outbreak","summary":"The 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak is the first modern large-scale outbreak of cholera—a disease once considered beaten back largely due to the invention of modern sanitation. The disease was reintroduced to Haiti in October 2010, not long after the disastrous earthquake earlier that year, and since then cholera has spread across the country and become endemic, causing high levels of both morbidity and mortality.[5] Nearly 800,000 Haitians have been infected by cholera, and more than 9,000 have died, according to the United Nations (UN).[6] Cholera transmission in Haiti today is largely a function of eradication efforts including WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene), education, oral vaccination,[7][8] and climate variability.[9] Early efforts were made to cover up the source of the epidemic, but thanks largely to the investigations of journalist Jonathan M. Katz and epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux,[10] today it is widely believed to be the result of contamination by infected United Nations peacekeepers deployed from Nepal.[11] In terms of total infections, the outbreak has since been surpassed by the war-fueled 2016–2021 Yemen cholera outbreak, although the Haiti outbreak is still one of the most deadly modern outbreaks.[12] As of August 2021 there have been no new cases of cholera in Haiti since February 2019.[13][14]","image":"Haiti_location_map.svg.png.webp","url":"2010s_Haiti_cholera_outbreak"}
