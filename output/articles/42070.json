{"title":"Star Wars Episode I: Battle for Naboo","summary":"Star Wars Episode I: Battle for Naboo[lower-alpha 1] is an arcade-style action game co-developed by FactorÂ 5 and LucasArts. It is a spiritual sequel to Star Wars: Rogue Squadron released two years earlier. Despite the similarities between the two games, the development team designed a new game engine for Battle for Naboo and included land- and water-based combat in addition to aerial combat. The player can control various air, land, and water vehicles; each offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. Bonus power-ups that improve these crafts' weapons or durability are hidden in different levels throughout the game. The player's performance is checked against four medal benchmarks after the completion of each level. Acquiring these medals promotes the player's rank and helps unlock hidden content.","image":"Star_Wars_Battle_for_Naboo_Nintendo64.jpg.webp","url":"Star_Wars_Episode_I:_Battle_for_Naboo"}
