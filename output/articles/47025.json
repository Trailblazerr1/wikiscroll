{"title":"Vagina","summary":"In mammals, the vagina is the elastic, muscular part of the female genital tract. In humans, it extends from the vestibule to the cervix. The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a thin layer of mucosal tissue called the hymen. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the uterus) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for sexual intercourse and birth.  It also channels menstrual flow, which occurs in humans and closely related primates as part of the menstrual cycle.","image":"Scheme_female_reproductive_system-en.svg.png.webp"}
