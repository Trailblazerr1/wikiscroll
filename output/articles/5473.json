{"title":"Bande dessinée","summary":"Bandes dessinées (singular bande dessinée; literally 'drawn strips'), abbreviated BDs and also referred to as Franco-Belgian comics (BD franco-belge), are comics that are usually originally in the French language and created for readership in France and Belgium.  These countries have a long tradition in comics separate from English-language comics.  Belgium is a bilingual country, and comics originally in the Dutch language (stripverhalen, literally \"strip stories\", or simply \"strips\") are part of bandes dessinées culturally; these BDs are translated to French and concurrently sold to the French-reading audience.","image":"Speech_balloon.svg.png.webp","url":"Bande_dessinée"}
