{"title":"Mercyful Fate","summary":"Mercyful Fate is a Danish heavy metal band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by progressive rock and hard rock, and with lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult, Mercyful Fate were part of the first wave of black metal in the early to mid-1980s, along with Venom and Bathory.[4] Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Mercyful Fate has also been acknowledged as a prominent influence on the subsequent heavy metal scene of 1980s and 1990s, including thrash metal bands like Metallica,[5] Slayer,[6] Testament,[7] Exodus[8] and Kreator,[9] and death metal bands such as Death,[10] Morbid Angel,[11] Obituary[12] and Cannibal Corpse.[13]","image":"King_Diamond_live_2006.jpg.webp","url":"Mercyful_Fate"}
