{"title":"Holliday junction","summary":"A Holliday junction is a branched nucleic acid structure that contains four double-stranded arms joined together. These arms may adopt one of several conformations depending on buffer salt concentrations and the sequence of nucleobases closest to the junction. The structure is named after Robin Holliday, the molecular biologist who proposed its existence in 1964.","image":"Неподвижная_структура_Холлидея_(англ.).svg.png.webp"}
