The competition has been held every four years and one year after the FIFA World Cup since 1991, when the inaugural tournament, then called the FIFA Women's World Championship, was held in China. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year qualification phase. The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot. The tournament proper, alternatively called the World Cup Finals, is contested at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of about one month.","image":"Trophée_Coupe_Monde_Féminine_Campus_Étoiles_St_Denis_Seine_St_Denis_3_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
