{"title":"Pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories","summary":"Pre-Columbian transoceanic contact theories are speculative theories which propose that possible visits to the Americas, possible interactions with the indigenous peoples of the Americas, or both, were made by people from Africa, Asia, Europe, or Oceania prior to Christopher Columbus' first voyage to the Caribbean in 1492 (i.e., during any part of the pre-Columbian era).[1] There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the earliest human migrations to the Americas may have been made by sea voyages, contemporary with and possibly predating land migrations over the Beringia land bridge,[2] but whether transoceanic travel may have continued into the historic period, resulting in pre-Columbian contact between the settled American peoples and voyagers from other continents, is vigorously debated.","image":"Viking_landing.jpg.webp"}
