{"title":"Don Carlos","summary":"Don Carlos[1] is a five-act grand opera composed by Giuseppe Verdi to a French-language libretto by Joseph Méry and Camille du Locle, based on the dramatic play Don Carlos, Infant von Spanien (Don Carlos, Infante of Spain) by Friedrich Schiller.  In addition, it has been noted by David Kimball that the Forest of Fontainebleau scene and auto-da-fé were the most substantial of several incidents borrowed from a contemporary play on Philip II by Eugène Cormon.[2]   The opera is most often performed in Italian translation, usually under the title Don Carlo.","image":"Giuseppe_Barberis_-_Carlo_Cornaglia_-_Giuseppe_Verdi's_Don_Carlo_at_La_Scala.jpg.webp"}
