{"title":"Ninurta","summary":"Ninurta (Sumerian: 𒀭𒊩𒌆𒅁: DNIN.URTA, \"Lord [of] Urta\" meaning of this name not known),[2] also known as Ninĝirsu (Sumerian: 𒀭𒊩𒌆𒄈𒋢: DNIN.ĜIR2.SU, meaning “Lord [of] Girsu”),[3][4] is an ancient Mesopotamian god associated with farming, healing, hunting, law, scribes, and war who was first worshipped in early Sumer. In the earliest records, he is a god of agriculture and healing, who cures humans of sicknesses and releases them from the power of demons. In later times, as Mesopotamia grew more militarized, he became a warrior deity, though he retained many of his earlier agricultural attributes. He was regarded as the son of the chief god Enlil and his main cult center in Sumer was the Eshumesha temple in Nippur. Ninĝirsu was honored by King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144–2124 BC), who rebuilt Ninĝirsu's temple in Lagash.","image":"Cropped_Image_of_Carving_Showing_the_Mesopotamian_God_Ninurta.png.webp"}
