{"title":"Failsworth","summary":"Failsworth is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham in Greater Manchester, England,[1][2][3] 3.7 miles (6.0 km) north-east of Manchester city centre and 2.9 miles (4.7 km) south-west of Oldham. The orbital M60 motorway skirts it to the east. The population at the 2011 census was 20,680.[4][5] Historically in Lancashire, Failsworth until the 19th century was a farming township linked ecclesiastically with Manchester.[6] Inhabitants supplemented their farming income with domestic hand-loom weaving. The humid climate and abundant labour and coal led to weaving of textiles as a Lancashire Mill Town with redbrick cotton mills. A current landmark is the Failsworth Pole. Daisy Nook is a country park on the southern edge.","image":"Failsworth.jpg.webp"}
