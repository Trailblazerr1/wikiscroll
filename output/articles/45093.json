{"title":"Thutmose I","summary":"Thutmose I (sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis I, Thothmes in older history works in Latinized Greek; Ancient Egyptian: ḏḥwtj-ms, Tʼaḥawtī-mīsaw, pronounced [tʼaˈħawtij ˈmisˌaw], meaning \"Thoth is born\") was the third pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. He received the throne after the death of the previous king, Amenhotep I. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before in each region. He also built many temples in Egypt, and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him).","image":"ColossalSandstoneHeadOfThutmoseI-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg.webp","url":"Thutmose_I"}
