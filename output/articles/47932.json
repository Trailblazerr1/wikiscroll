{"title":"War on drugs","summary":"The war on drugs is a global campaign,[6] led by the U.S. federal government, of drug prohibition, military aid, and military intervention, with the aim of reducing the illegal drug trade in the United States.[7][8][9][10] The initiative includes a set of drug policies that are intended to discourage the production, distribution, and consumption of psychoactive drugs that the participating governments and the UN have made illegal. The term was popularized by the media shortly after a press conference given on June 18, 1971, by President Richard Nixon—the day after publication of a special message from President Nixon to the Congress on Drug Abuse Prevention and Control—during which he declared drug abuse \"public enemy number one\". That message to the Congress included text about devoting more federal resources to the \"prevention of new addicts, and the rehabilitation of those who are addicted\" but that part did not receive the same public attention as the term \"war on drugs\".[11][12][13] Two years prior to this, Nixon had formally declared a \"war on drugs\" that would be directed toward eradication, interdiction, and incarceration.[14] In 2015, the Drug Policy Alliance, which advocates for an end to the War on Drugs, estimated that the United States spends $51 billion annually on these initiatives, and in 2021, after 50 years of the drug war, others have estimated that the US has spent a cumulative $1 trillion on it.[15][16]","image":"CIA_Map_of_International_illegal_drug_connections.gif","url":"War_on_drugs"}
