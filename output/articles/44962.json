{"title":"Thomas Brassey","summary":"Thomas Brassey (7 November 1805 – 8 December 1870[1]) was an English civil engineering contractor and manufacturer of building materials who was responsible for building much of the world's railways in the 19th century. By 1847, he had built about one-third of the railways in Britain, and by time of his death in 1870 he had built one in every twenty miles of railway in the world.  This included three-quarters of the lines in France, major lines in many other European countries and in Canada, Australia, South America and India.  He also built the structures associated with those railways, including docks, bridges, viaducts, stations, tunnels and drainage works.","image":"Brassey-2.jpg.webp"}
