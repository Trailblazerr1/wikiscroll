{"title":"Mutagen","summary":"In genetics, a mutagen is a physical or chemical agent that permanently changes genetic material, usually DNA, in an organism and thus increases the frequency of mutations above the natural background level. As many mutations can cause cancer, such mutagens are therefore carcinogens, although not all necessarily are. All mutagens have characteristic mutational signatures with some chemicals becoming mutagenic through cellular processes. Not all mutations are caused by mutagens: so-called \"spontaneous mutations\" occur due to spontaneous hydrolysis, errors in DNA replication, repair and recombination.","image":"GHS-pictogram-silhouette.svg.png.webp","url":"Mutagen"}
