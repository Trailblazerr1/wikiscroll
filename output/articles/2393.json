{"title":"Age of the universe","summary":"In physical cosmology, the age of the universe is the time elapsed since the Big Bang. Today, astronomers have derived two different measurements of the age of the universe:[1]\na measurement based on direct observations of an early state of the universe, which indicate an age of 13.787±0.020 billion years as interpreted with the Lambda-CDM concordance model as of 2018;[2]\nand a measurement based on the observations of the local, modern universe, which suggest a younger age.[3][4][5]\nThe uncertainty of the first kind of measurement has been narrowed down to 20 million years, based on a number of studies which all gave extremely similar  figures for the age. These include studies of the microwave background radiation by the Planck spacecraft, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and other space probes. Measurements of the cosmic background radiation give the cooling time of the universe since the Big Bang,[6]\nand measurements of the expansion rate of the universe can be used to calculate its approximate age by extrapolating backwards in time. The range of the estimate is also within the range of the estimate for the oldest observed star in the universe.","image":"Planck_satellite_cmb.jpg.webp"}
