{"title":"Clay","summary":"Clay is a type of fine-grained natural soil material containing clay minerals.[1] Clays develop plasticity when wet, due to a molecular film of water surrounding the clay particles, but become hard, brittle and nonâ€“plastic upon drying or firing.[2][3][4] Most pure clay minerals are white or light-coloured, but natural clays show a variety of colours from impurities, such as a reddish or brownish colour from small amounts of iron oxide.[5][6]","image":"Gay_head_cliffs_MV.JPG.webp"}
