{"title":"Honey","summary":"Honey is a sweet, viscous food substance made by honey bees and some other bees.[1][2] Bees produce honey from the sugary secretions of plants (floral nectar) or from secretions of other insects (such as honeydew), by regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. Honey bees store honey in wax structures called  honeycombs, whereas stingless bees store honey in pots made of wax and resin.[1][2][3] The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus Apis) is the best-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption.[4] Honey is collected from wild bee colonies, or from hives of domesticated bees, a practice known as beekeeping or apiculture (meliponiculture in the case of stingless bees).","image":"Runny_hunny.jpg.webp","url":"Honey"}
