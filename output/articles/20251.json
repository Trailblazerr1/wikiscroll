{"title":"Hezbollah","summary":"Hezbollah (/ˌhɛzbəˈlɑː/;[31] Arabic: حزب الله‎ Ḥizbu 'llāh, literally \"Party of Allah\" or \"Party of God\", also transliterated Hizbullah or Hizballah, among others)[32] is a Lebanese Shia Islamist political party and militant group,[33][34] led by its Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah since 1992. Hezbollah's paramilitary wing is the Jihad Council,[35] and its political wing is the Loyalty to the Resistance Bloc party in the Lebanese Parliament. Either the entire organization or only its military wing has been designated a terrorist organization by several countries, including by the European Union[36] and, since 2017, also by most member states of the Arab League, with two exceptions – Lebanon, where Hezbollah is the most powerful political party, and Iraq.[37] Russia does not view Hezbollah as a \"terrorist organization\" but as a \"legitimate socio-political force\".[38]","image":"Hezbollah_political_militia_logo.png.webp"}
