{"title":"Patrician (ancient Rome)","summary":"The patricians (from Latin: patricius) were originally a group of ruling class families in ancient Rome. The distinction was highly significant in the Roman Kingdom, and the early Republic, but its relevance waned after the Conflict of the Orders (494 BC to 287 BC). By the time of the late Republic and Empire, membership in the patriciate was of only nominal significance.","image":"She-wolf_suckles_Romulus_and_Remus.jpg.webp","url":"Patrician_(ancient_Rome)"}
