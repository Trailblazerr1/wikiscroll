{"title":"A* search algorithm","summary":"A* (pronounced \"A-star\") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.[1] One major practical drawback is its \n  \n    \n      \n        O\n        (\n        \n          b\n          \n            d\n          \n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle O(b^{d})}\n  \n space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance,[2] as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases.[3]","image":"c99d691c81f015266d1626ef381d2a1a49466fbb.svg"}
