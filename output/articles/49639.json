{"title":"Śvētāmbara","summary":"The Śvētāmbara (/ʃwɛˈtʌmbərə/; śvētapaṭa; also spelled Shwethambara, Svetambar, Shvetambara or Swetambar) is one of the two main branches of Jainism, the other being the Digambara. Śvētāmbara means \"white-clad\", and refers to its ascetics' practice of wearing white clothes, which sets it apart from the Digambara \"sky-clad\" Jains, whose ascetic practitioners go naked. Śvētāmbaras, unlike Digambaras, do not believe that ascetics must practice nudity.[1]","image":"Parshvanatha_Mysuru_Karnataka_Svetambara_Jain_temple.jpg.webp"}
