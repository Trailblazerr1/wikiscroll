{"title":"Boltzmann constant","summary":"The Boltzmann constant (kB or k) is the proportionality factor that relates the average relative kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the thermodynamic temperature of the gas.[2] It occurs in the definitions of the kelvin and the gas constant, and in Planck's law of black-body radiation and Boltzmann's entropy formula. The Boltzmann constant has dimensions of energy divided by temperature, the same as entropy.  It is named after the Austrian scientist Ludwig Boltzmann.","image":"Ideal_gas_law_relationships.svg.png.webp","url":"Boltzmann_constant"}
