{"title":"Translation lookaside buffer","summary":"A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location.[1] It is a part of the chip's memory-management unit (MMU). The TLB stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory and can be called an address-translation cache. A TLB may reside between the CPU and the CPU cache, between CPU cache and the main memory or between the different levels of the multi-level cache. The majority of desktop, laptop, and server processors include one or more TLBs in the memory-management hardware, and it is nearly always present in any processor that utilizes paged or segmented virtual memory.","image":"Translation_Lookaside_Buffer.png.webp","url":"Translation_lookaside_buffer"}
