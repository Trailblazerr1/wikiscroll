{"title":"Sarcopterygii","summary":"Sarcopterygii (/ˌsɑːrkɒptəˈrɪdʒi.aɪ/; from Ancient Greek  σάρξ (sárx) 'flesh', and  πτέρυξ (ptérux) 'wing, fins') — sometimes considered synonymous with Crossopterygii (from Ancient Greek  κροσσός (krossós) 'fringe') — is a taxon (traditionally a class or subclass) of the bony fishes whose members are known as lobe-finned fishes. The group Tetrapoda, a superclass including amphibians, reptiles (including dinosaurs and therefore birds), and mammals, evolved from certain sarcopterygians; under a cladistic view, tetrapods are themselves considered a group within Sarcopterygii.","image":"Sarcopterygii.png.webp"}
