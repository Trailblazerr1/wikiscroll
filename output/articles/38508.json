{"title":"Rosalind Franklin","summary":"Rosalind Elsie Franklin (25 July 1920 – 16 April 1958)[1] was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite.[2] Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely unrecognized during her life, for which she has been variously referred to as the \"wronged heroine\",[3] the \"dark lady of DNA\",[4] the \"forgotten heroine\",[5] a \"feminist icon\",[6] and the \"Sylvia Plath of molecular biology\".[7]","image":"Rosalind_Franklin_(1920-1958).jpg.webp","url":"Rosalind_Franklin"}
