{"title":"Lambeosaurus","summary":"Lambeosaurus (/ˌlæmbiəˈsɔːrəs/ LAM-bee-ə-SAWR-əs,[1] meaning \"Lambe's lizard\") is a genus of hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived about 75 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) of North America. This bipedal/quadrupedal, herbivorous dinosaur is known for its distinctive hollow cranial crest, which in the best-known species resembled a hatchet. Several possible species have been named, from Canada, the United States, and Mexico, but only the two Canadian species are currently recognized as valid.","image":"Lambeosaurus_ROM.jpg.webp","url":"Lambeosaurus"}
