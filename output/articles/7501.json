{"title":"Breast","summary":"The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants.[2] Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in female humans and to a much lesser extent in other primates.  Breast development in other primate females generally only occurs with pregnancy.","image":"Weibliche_brust_en.jpg.webp"}
