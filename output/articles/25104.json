{"title":"Kubernetes","summary":"Kubernetes (/ˌk(j)uːbərˈnɛtɪs, -ˈneɪtɪs, -ˈneɪtiːz, -ˈnɛtiːz/, commonly stylized as K8s[4]) is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.[5] It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a \"platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of container workloads\".[6] It works with a variety of container runtimes such as Docker, Containerd, and CRI-O.[7]  Kubernetes originally interfaced exclusively with the Docker runtime[8] through a \"Dockershim\"; however, the shim has since been deprecated in favor of directly interfacing with the container through containerd, or replacing Docker with a runtime that is compliant with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) introduced by Kubernetes in 2016.[9][10][11]","image":"Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg.png.webp"}
