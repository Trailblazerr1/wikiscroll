{"title":"Bam Bam Bigelow","summary":"Scott Charles Bigelow (September 1, 1961 â€“ January 19, 2007) was an American professional wrestler, better known by the ring name  Bam Bam Bigelow. Recognizable by his close to 400-pound frame and the distinctive flame tattoo that spanned most of his bald head, Bigelow was hailed by Ryan Murphy (a writer for Bigelow's former employer WWE) as \"the most natural, agile and physically remarkable big man of the past quarter century\",[3] while former co-worker Bret Hart described him as \"possibly the best working big man in the business.\"[4]","image":"Bigelow_at_Wembley.jpg.webp"}
