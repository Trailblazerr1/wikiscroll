{"title":"Sunspot","summary":"Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots appear within active regions, usually in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity.[2] Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.","image":"Solar_eclipse_of_October_23_2014_start_of_partial.jpg.webp","url":"Sunspot"}
