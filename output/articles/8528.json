{"title":"Capuchin monkey","summary":"The capuchin monkeys (/ˈkæpjʊ(t)ʃɪn/) are New World monkeys of the subfamily Cebinae. They are readily identified as the \"organ grinder\" monkey, and have been used in many movies and television shows. The range of capuchin monkeys includes some tropical forests in Central America and South America as far south as northern Argentina. In Central America, where they are called white-faced monkeys (\"carablanca\"), they usually occupy the wet lowland forests on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and Panama and deciduous dry forest on the Pacific coast.","image":"Capuchin_Costa_Rica.jpg.webp"}
