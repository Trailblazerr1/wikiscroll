{"title":"Great Flood (China)","summary":"The Great Flood of Gun-Yu (Chinese: 鯀禹治水), also known as the Gun-Yu myth,[1] was a major flood event in ancient China that allegedly continued for at least two generations, which resulted in great population displacements among other disasters, such as storms and famine.  People left their homes to live on the high hills and mounts, or nest on the trees.[2]  According to mythological and historical sources, it is traditionally dated to the third millennium BCE, or about 2300-2200 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Yao.","image":"Nine_Provinces_of_China.png.webp"}
