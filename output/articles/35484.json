{"title":"Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts","summary":"The Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts is a dicastery of the Roman Curia. Its work \"consists mainly in interpreting the laws of the Church\". (Pastor Bonus, 154).[1] It is distinct from the highest tribunal or court in the Church, which is the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, and does not have law-making authority to the degree the Pope and the Holy See's tribunals do. Its charge is the interpretation of existing canon laws, and it works closely with the Signatura and the other Tribunals and the Pope. Like the Signatura and the other two final appellate Tribunals, the Roman Rota and the Apostolic Penitentiary, it is led by a prefect who is a bishop or archbishop.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp"}
