{"title":"Kantian ethics","summary":"Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory developed by German philosopher Immanuel Kant that is based on the notion that: \"It is impossible to think of anything at all in the world, or indeed even beyond it, that could be considered good without limitation except a good will.\" The theory was developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, stating that an action can only be right if its maxim—the principle behind it—is duty to the moral law, and arises from a sense of duty in the actor.","image":"Immanuel_Kant_(painted_portrait).jpg.webp"}
