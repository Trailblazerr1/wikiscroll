They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland—which at the time were separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarch—were, in the words of the Treaty, \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\".[2]","image":"Coat_of_Arms_of_England_(1702-1707).svg.png.webp","url":"Acts_of_Union_1707"}
