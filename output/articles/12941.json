{"title":"Diet in Hinduism","summary":"Diet in Hinduism varies with its diverse traditions. Many Hindus follow a Lacto-vegetarian diet that they believe is in sync with nature, compassionate, respectful of other life forms.[1] Diet of non-vegetarian Hindus can include fish, poultry and red meat (mainly lamb, goat and buffalo but occasionally pork and wild boar[2]) in addition to eggs and dairy products. For slaughtering animals and birds for food, meat-eating Hindus often favor jhatka (quick death) style preparation of meat since  Hindus believe that this method minimizes trauma and suffering to the animal.[3][4] Ancient Hindu texts describe the whole of creation as a vast food chain, and the cosmos as a giant food cycle.[5]","image":"The_Complete_Meal.jpg.webp"}
