{"title":"Masdar City","summary":"Masdar City (Arabic: مدينة مصدر‎, romanized: Madīnat Maṣdar, lit. 'Source City')[1] is a planned city project in Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates. Its core is being built by Masdar, a subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company, with the majority of seed capital provided by the Government of Abu Dhabi.[2][3] Designed by the British architectural firm Foster and Partners. The city relies on solar energy and other renewable energy sources.[4][5] Masdar City is being constructed 17 kilometres (11 mi) east-south-east of the city of Abu Dhabi, a five minute drive from Abu Dhabi International Airport and 40 minutes from Dubai. The city will be connected to existing urban areas via roads and light-rail.[6] Masdar City hosts the headquarters of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).[7][8] The city is designed to be a hub for cleantech companies. Its first tenant was the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, which has been operating in the city since it moved into its campus in September 2010.[9][10][11]","image":"Masdar_City.jpg.webp"}
