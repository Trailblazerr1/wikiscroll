{"title":"Biochemical oxygen demand","summary":"Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)  is the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) needed (i.e. demanded) by aerobic biological organisms to break down organic material present in a given water sample at certain temperature over a specific time period. The BOD value is most commonly expressed in milligrams of oxygen consumed per litre of sample during 5 days of incubation at 20 °C and is often used as a surrogate of the degree of organic pollution of water.[1]","image":"BOD_test_bottles_(biological_oxygen_demand)_(3231600029).jpg.webp","url":"Biochemical_oxygen_demand"}
