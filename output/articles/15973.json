{"title":"Femininity","summary":"Femininity (also called womanliness or girlishness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles generally associated with women and girls. Although sociologists think of femininity as socially constructed,[1] there is also widespread recognition that some behaviors considered feminine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors.[1][2][3][4] To what extent femininity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.[2][3][4] It is distinct from the definition of the biological female sex,[5][6] as both males and females can exhibit feminine traits.","image":"Titian_-_Venus_with_a_Mirror_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp","url":"Femininity"}
