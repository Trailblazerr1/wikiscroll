{"title":"Health","summary":"Health, according to the World Health Organization, is \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity\".[1] A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular physical exercise and adequate sleep,[2] and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.","image":"Smallpox_eradication_team.jpg.webp","url":"Health"}
