{"title":"12 Years a Slave (film)","summary":"12 Years a Slave is a 2013 biographical period-drama film directed by Steve McQueen from a screenplay by John Ridley, based on  the 1853 slave memoir Twelve Years a Slave by Solomon Northup, a New York State-born free African-American man who was kidnapped in Washington, D.C. by two conmen in 1841 and sold into slavery. Northup was put to work on plantations in the state of Louisiana for 12 years before being released. The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited in 1968 by Sue Eakin and Joseph Logsdon, carefully retraced and validated the account and concluded it to be accurate.[4]","image":"12_Years_a_Slave_film_poster.jpg.webp"}
