{"title":"List of Masters Tournament champions","summary":"The Masters Tournament is a golf competition that was established in 1934, with Horton Smith winning the inaugural tournament.[1] The Masters is the first of four major championships to be played each year, with the final round of the Masters always being scheduled for the second Sunday in April.[2] The Masters is the only one of the four majors to use the same course every year; the Augusta National Golf Club.[3] Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the U.S. Open, the Open Championship (British Open), and the PGA Championship) for the next five years, and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters. They also receive membership on the PGA Tour for the following five seasons and invitations to the Players Championship for the five years following their victory.[4] The champion also receives the \"Green Jacket\", the first one being won by Sam Snead in 1949. The champion takes the jacket home for a year and returns it thereafter. A multiple champion will only have one jacket unless his size changes dramatically.[5]","image":"JackNicklaus.cropped.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Masters_Tournament_champions"}
