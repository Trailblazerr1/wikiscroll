{"title":"Braided river","summary":"A braided river, or braided channel, consists of a network of river channels separated by small, often temporary, islands called braid bars or, in English usage, aits or eyots. Braided streams tend to occur in rivers with high sediment loads and/or coarse grain sizes,[1][2] and in rivers with steeper slopes than typical rivers with straight or meandering channel patterns.[3] They are also associated with rivers with rapid and frequent variation in the amount of water they carry, i.e., with \"flashy\" rivers, and with rivers with weak banks.[4] Braided channels are found in a variety of environments all over the world, including gravelly mountain streams, sand bed rivers, on alluvial fans, on river deltas, and across depositional plains.[4][5]","image":"Waimakariri01_gobeirne.jpg.webp"}
