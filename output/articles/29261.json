{"title":"Melatonin","summary":"Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night, and has long been associated with control of the sleepâ€“wake cycle.[3][4] As a dietary supplement, it is often used for the short-term treatment of insomnia, such as from jet lag or shift work, and is typically taken orally.[5][6][7] Evidence of its benefit for this use, however, is not strong.[8] A 2017 review found that sleep onset occurred six minutes faster with use, but found no change in total time asleep.[6]","image":"Melatonin.svg.png.webp"}
