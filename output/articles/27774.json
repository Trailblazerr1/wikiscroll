{"title":"MD5","summary":"The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a cryptographically broken but still widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database, and may be preferred due to lower computational requirements than more recent Secure Hash Algorithms algorithms.[3]","image":"CPT-Hashing-File-Transmission.svg.png.webp","url":"MD5"}
