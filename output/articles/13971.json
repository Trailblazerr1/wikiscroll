{"title":"Earth Song","summary":"\"Earth Song\" is a song by American singer Michael Jackson from his ninth studio album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. It was released on November 27, 1995, by Epic Records as the third single from the album. It is a ballad that incorporates elements of blues, gospel and opera. Though Jackson had a long history of releasing socially conscious songs such as \"We Are the World\", \"Man in the Mirror\" and \"Heal the World\", \"Earth Song\" was his first to overtly discuss the environment and animal welfare. \"Earth Song\" was made for the Dangerous album but it failed to make the final cut.","image":"Earth_Song_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Earth_Song"}
