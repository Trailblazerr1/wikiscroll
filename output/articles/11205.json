{"title":"Corn Laws","summary":"The Corn Laws were tariffs and other trade restrictions on imported food and corn enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846. The word corn in British English denotes all cereal grains, including wheat, oats and barley. They were designed to keep corn prices high to favour domestic producers, and represented British mercantilism.[lower-alpha 1] The Corn Laws blocked the import of cheap corn, initially by simply forbidding importation below a set price, and later by imposing steep import duties, making it too expensive to import it from abroad, even when food supplies were short.","image":"1815_Corn_Law%2C_An_Act_to_amend_the_Laws_now_in_force_for_regulating_the_Importation_of_Corn.jpg.webp"}
