{"title":"Panama hat","summary":"A Panama hat, also known as an Ecuadorian hat, a jipijapa hat, or a toquilla straw hat, is a traditional brimmed straw hat of Ecuadorian origin. Traditionally, hats were made from the plaited leaves of the Carludovica palmata plant, known locally as the toquilla palm or jipijapa palm,[1] although it is a palm-like plant rather than a true palm.","image":"Panama_hat.jpg.webp"}
