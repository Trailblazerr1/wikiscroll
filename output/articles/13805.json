{"title":"Dust Bowl","summary":"The Dust Bowl was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent the aeolian processes (wind erosion) caused the phenomenon.[1][2] The drought came in three waves: 1934, 1936, and 1939â€“1940, but some regions of the High Plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.[3]","image":"Map_of_states_and_counties_affected_by_the_Dust_Bowl%2C_sourced_from_US_federal_government_dept._(NRCS_SSRA-RAD).svg.png.webp","url":"Dust_Bowl"}
