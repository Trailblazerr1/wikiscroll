{"title":"Internet Relay Chat","summary":"Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based chat (instant messaging) system. It enables discussions among any number of participants in so-called conversation channels, as well as discussions between only two partners â€” for example, in question-and-answer dialogues.[1] Any participant may open a new conversation channel, and a single computer user can also take part in several such simultaneous channels.","image":"Tolsun_2.jpg.webp"}
