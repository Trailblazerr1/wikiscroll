{"title":"Scania","summary":"Scania, also known by its native name of Skåne[3] (Swedish: [ˈskôːnɛ] (listen), Danish: [ˈskɔːnə]), is the southernmost of the historical provinces (landskap) of Sweden. The former province is roughly conterminous with Skåne County, created in 1997. Like the other former provinces of Sweden, Scania still features in colloquial speech and in cultural references, and can therefore not be regarded as an archaic concept. Within Scania there are 33 municipalities that are autonomous within the Skåne Regional Council. Scania's largest city, Malmö, is the third-largest city in Sweden, as well as the fifth-largest in Scandinavia.","image":"Skånska_flaggan.svg.png.webp","url":"Scania"}
