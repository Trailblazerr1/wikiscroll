{"title":"Evolution of lemurs","summary":"Lemurs, primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini which branched off from other primates less than 63 million years ago, evolved on the island of Madagascar, for at least 40Â million years.  They share some traits with the most basal primates, and thus are often confused as being ancestral to modern monkeys, apes, and humans.  Instead, they merely resemble ancestral primates.","image":"Microcebus_rufus_001b.jpg.webp","url":"Evolution_of_lemurs"}
