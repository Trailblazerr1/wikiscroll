{"title":"Infectious mononucleosis","summary":"Infectious mononucleosis (IM, mono), also known as glandular fever, is an infection usually caused by the Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV).[2][3] Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces few or no symptoms.[2] In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, and tiredness.[2] Most people recover in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months.[2] The liver or spleen may also become swollen,[3] and in less than one percent of cases splenic rupture may occur.[6]","image":"Lymphadanopathy.JPG.webp"}
