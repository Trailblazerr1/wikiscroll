{"title":"1996 Summer Olympics","summary":"The 1996 Summer Olympics (officially the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, also known as Atlanta 1996 and commonly referred to as the Centennial Olympic Games)[2][3][4] were an international multi-sport event held from July 19 to August 4, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. These were the fourth Summer Olympics to be hosted by the United States, and marked the centennial of the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, the inaugural edition of the modern Olympic Games. These were also the first Summer Olympics since 1924 to be held in a different year than the Winter Olympics, as part of a new IOC practice implemented in 1994 to hold the Summer and Winter Games in alternating, even-numbered years. These were also the last Summer Olympics to be held in North America until 2028, when Los Angeles will host the games for the third time.","image":"1996_Summer_Olympics_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"1996_Summer_Olympics"}
