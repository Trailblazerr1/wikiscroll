{"title":"Captopril","summary":"Captopril, sold under the brand name Capoten among others, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension and some types of congestive heart failure. Captopril was the first oral ACE inhibitor found for the treatment of hypertension.[2] Unlike beta-blockers, another class of drugs used to treat angina and hypertension, Captopril does not generally impair intellectual or sexual functions. It also does not cause fatigue as associated with beta-blockers. Due to the adverse drug event of causing hyperkalemia, as seen with most ACE Inhibitors, the medication is usually paired with a diuretic.","image":"Captopril_structure.svg.png.webp"}
