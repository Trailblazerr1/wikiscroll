{"title":"Zipf's law","summary":"Zipf's law (/zɪf/, not /tsɪpf/ as in German) is an empirical law formulated using mathematical statistics that refers to the fact that for many types of data studied in the physical and social sciences, the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. The Zipfian distribution is one of a family of related discrete power law probability distributions. It is related to the zeta distribution, but is not identical.","image":"Zipf_distribution_PMF.png.webp","url":"Zipf's_law"}
