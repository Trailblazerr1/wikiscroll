{"title":"Treponema pallidum","summary":"Treponema pallidum is a spirochaete bacterium with various subspecies that cause the diseases syphilis, bejel, and yaws. It is transmitted only amongst humans.[1] It is a helically coiled microorganism usually 6–15 μm long and 0.1–0.2 μm wide.[2] T. pallidum's lack of either tricarboxylic acid cycle or oxidative phosphorylation results in minimal metabolic activity.[3] The treponemes have a cytoplasmic and an outer membrane. Using light microscopy, treponemes are visible only by using dark field illumination. Treponema pallidum consists of three subspecies, T. p. pallidum, T. p. endemicum, and T. p. pertenue, each of which has a distinct associated disease.[4]","image":"Treponema_pallidum.jpg.webp","url":"Treponema_pallidum"}
