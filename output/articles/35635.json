{"title":"Portrait of an American Family","summary":"Portrait of an American Family is the debut studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on July 19, 1994 by Nothing and Interscope Records. The group was formed in 1989 by vocalist Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz, whose names were created by combining the given name of a pop culture icon with the surname of a serial killer: a naming convention which all other band members would conform to for the next seven years. The most prominent lineup of musicians during their formative years included keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy, bassist Gidget Gein and drummer Sara Lee Lucas.","image":"Marilyn_Manson_-_Portrait_of_an_American_Family.png.webp","url":"Portrait_of_an_American_Family"}
