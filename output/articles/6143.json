{"title":"Bell's theorem","summary":"Bell's theorem proves that quantum physics is incompatible with certain types of local hidden-variable theories. It was introduced by physicist John Stewart Bell in a 1964 paper titled \"On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox\", referring to a 1935 thought experiment that Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen used in order to argue that quantum physics is an \"incomplete\" theory.[1][2] By 1935, it was already recognized that the predictions of quantum physics are probabilistic. Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen presented a scenario that, in their view, indicated that quantum particles, like electrons and photons, must carry physical properties or attributes not included in quantum theory, and the uncertainties in quantum theory's predictions were due to ignorance of these properties, later termed \"hidden variables\". Their scenario involves a pair of widely separated physical objects, prepared in such a way that the quantum state of the pair is entangled.","image":"page1-400px-Mermin's_inequality.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Bell's_theorem"}
