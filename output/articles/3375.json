{"title":"Amoraim","summary":"Amoraim (Aramaic: plural אמוראים‎ ʔamoraˈʔim or ʔamorajim, singular Amora אמורא‎ ʔamoˈʁa or Amoray; \"those who say\" or \"those who speak over the people\", or \"spokesmen\")[1] refers to Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who \"said\" or \"told over\" the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were primarily located in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The Amoraim followed the Tannaim in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The Tannaim were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the Amoraim expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification.","image":"fb780d4de9eebee62e5d4da757063f9e.png.webp"}
