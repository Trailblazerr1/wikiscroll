{"title":"Vaslav Nijinsky","summary":"Vaslav (or Vatslav) Nijinsky (/ˌvɑːtslɑːf nɪˈ(d)ʒɪnski/; Russian: Вацлав Фомич Нижинский, tr. Václav Fomíč Nižínskij, IPA: [ˈvatsləf fɐˈmʲitɕ nʲɪˈʐɨnskʲɪj]; Polish: Wacław Niżyński, IPA: [ˈvatswaf ɲiˈʐɨj̃skʲi]; 12 March 1889[1][2]/1890[3] – 8 April 1950) was a ballet dancer and choreographer cited as the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century.[3] Born in Kiev to Polish parents, Nijinsky grew up in Imperial Russia but considered himself to be Polish.[4] He was celebrated for his virtuosity and for the depth and intensity of his characterizations. He could dance en pointe, a rare skill among male dancers at the time,[5] and was admired for his seemingly gravity-defying leaps.","image":"Talisman_-Vayou_-Vaslav_Nijinsky_-1909.JPG.webp"}
