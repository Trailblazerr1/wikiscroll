{"title":"City","summary":"A city is a large human settlement.[1][2][lower-alpha 1] It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks.[3] Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, production of goods, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution.","image":"Palace_of_Westminster_from_the_dome_on_Methodist_Central_Hall_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"City"}
