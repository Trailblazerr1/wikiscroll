{"title":"Mahayana","summary":"Mahāyāna (/ˌmɑːhəˈjɑːnə/; \"Great Vehicle\") is a term for a broad group of Buddhist traditions, texts, philosophies, and practices. Mahāyāna Buddhism developed in India (c. 1st century BCE onwards) and is considered one of the two main existing branches of Buddhism (the other being Theravāda).[1] Mahāyāna accepts the main scriptures and teachings of early Buddhism, but also adds various new doctrines and texts such as the Mahāyāna Sūtras and its emphasis on the bodhisattva path and Prajñāpāramitā.[2] Vajrayāna or Mantra traditions are a subset of Mahāyāna, which make use of numerous tantric methods considered to be faster and more powerful at achieving Buddhahood by Vajrayānists.[1]","image":"Astasahasrika_Prajnaparamita_Maitreya_Detail.jpeg.webp","url":"Mahayana"}
