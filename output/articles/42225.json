{"title":"Stem rust","summary":"Stem rust, also known as cereal rust, black rust,[1][2] red rust or red dust,[3] is caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis, which causes significant disease in cereal crops. Crop species that are affected by the disease include bread wheat, durum wheat, barley and triticale.[1] These diseases have affected cereal farming throughout history. The annual recurrence of stem rust of wheat in North Indian plains was discovered by Prof. K.C. Mehta.[4] Since the 1950s, wheat strains bred to be resistant to stem rust have become available.[5] Fungicides effective against stem rust are available as well.[6]","image":"Stem_rust_close_up.jpg.webp"}
