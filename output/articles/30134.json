{"title":"Missouri River","summary":"The Missouri River is the longest river in North America.[13] Rising in the Rocky Mountains of the Eastern Centennial Mountains of Southwestern Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for 2,341 miles (3,767 km)[9] before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river drains a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles (1,300,000 km2), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Although nominally considered a tributary of the Mississippi, the Missouri River above the confluence is much longer[14] and carries a comparable volume of water.[11][15] When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.[13]","image":"Missouri_River_in_2021_01.jpg.webp"}
