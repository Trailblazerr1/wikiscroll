{"title":"Fructose","summary":"Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a ketonic simple sugar found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into blood during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847.[5][6] The name \"fructose\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller.[7] Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars.[8] Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.","image":"Skeletal_Structure_of_Cyclic_D-Fructose.svg.png.webp","url":"Fructose"}
