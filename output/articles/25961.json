{"title":"Let's Play","summary":"A Let's Play (LP)  is a video (or screenshots accompanied by text) documenting the playthrough of a video game, usually including commentary or a camera view of the gamer's face.[1] A Let's Play differs from a video game walkthrough or strategy guide by focusing on an individual's subjective experience with the game, often with humorous, irreverent, or critical commentary from the gamer, rather than being an objective source of information on how to progress through the game.[2] While Let's Plays and live streaming of game playthroughs are related, Let's Plays tend to be curated experiences that include editing and narration, can be scripted, while streaming is an unedited experience performed on the fly.[3]","image":"WPVG_icon_2016.svg.png.webp"}
