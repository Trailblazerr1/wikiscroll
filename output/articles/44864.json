{"title":"Thermal efficiency","summary":"In thermodynamics, the thermal efficiency ( Î· t h {\\displaystyle \\eta _{\\rm {th}}} ) is a dimensionless performance measure of a device that uses thermal energy, such as an internal combustion engine, a steam turbine or a steam engine, a boiler, furnace, or a refrigerator for example. For a heat engine, thermal efficiency is the fraction of the energy added by heat (primary energy) that is converted to net work output (secondary energy). In the case of a refrigeration or heat pump cycle, thermal efficiency is the ratio of net heat output for heating, or removal for cooling, to energy input (the coefficient of performance).","image":"3984ed6934114aa8b5067c79422883038ce012b1.svg","url":"Thermal_efficiency"}
