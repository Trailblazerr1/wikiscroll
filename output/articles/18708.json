{"title":"Graphic novel","summary":"A graphic novel is a book made up of comics content. Although the word \"novel\" normally refers to long fictional works, the term \"graphic novel\" is applied broadly and includes fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work. It is, at least in the United States, typically distinguished from the term \"comic book\", which is generally used for comics periodicals and trade paperbacks (see American comic book).[1][2]","image":"Contractwithgod.png.webp"}
