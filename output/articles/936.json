{"title":"8-bit computing","summary":"In computerÂ architecture, 8-bit integers or other data units are those that are 8 bits wide (1 octet).  Also, 8-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers or data buses of that size. Memory addresses (and thus address buses) for 8-bit CPUs are generally larger than 8-bit, usually 16-bit, while they could in theory be 8-bit, and in some situations 8-bit addresses are also used with 16-bit addresses mainly used. '8-bit' is also a generation of microcomputers in which 8-bit microprocessors were the norm.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"8-bit_computing"}
