{"title":"Milling cutter","summary":"Milling cutters are cutting tools typically used in milling machines or machining centres to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools). They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g., a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g., a form tool such as a hobbing cutter).","image":"End_Mill_02_labels.png.webp","url":"Milling_cutter"}
