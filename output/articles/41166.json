Its formation was initiated in 1941, and achieved in 1944–1946, when it was established as a federated republic within Yugoslavia. In that form, it lasted until the constitutional reforms from 1990 to 1992, when it was reconstituted, as the Republic of Serbia within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was the largest constituent state of Yugoslavia, in terms of population and territory. Its capital, Belgrade, was also the federal capital of Yugoslavia.[1][2][3]","image":"Flag_of_Serbia_(1947–1992)%3B_Flag_of_Montenegro_(1946–1993).svg.png.webp","url":"Socialist_Republic_of_Serbia"}
