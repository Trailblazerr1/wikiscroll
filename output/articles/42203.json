{"title":"Stefan–Boltzmann law","summary":"The Stefan–Boltzmann law describes the power radiated from a black body in terms of its temperature.  Specifically, the Stefan–Boltzmann law states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a black body across all wavelengths per unit time \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          j\n          \n            ⋆\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle j^{\\star }}\n  \n (also known as the black-body radiant emittance) is directly proportional to the fourth power of the black body's thermodynamic temperature T:","image":"5f59b290ce4b139034a47edaa26795c4616b0204.svg"}
