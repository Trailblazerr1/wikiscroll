{"title":"Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)","summary":"Frédéric Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, Op. 35, is a piano sonata in four movements. Chopin completed the work while living in George Sand's manor in Nohant, some 250 km (160 mi) south of Paris, a year before it was published in 1840. The first of the composer's three mature sonatas (the others being the Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor, Op. 58 and the Sonata for Piano and Cello in G minor, Op. 65), the work is considered to be one of the greatest piano sonatas of the literature.","image":"Chopin%2C_by_Wodzinska.JPG.webp","url":"Piano_Sonata_No._2_(Chopin)"}
