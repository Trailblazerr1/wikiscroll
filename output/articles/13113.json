{"title":"Disc brake","summary":"A disc brake is a type of brake that uses the calipers to squeeze pairs of pads against a disc or a \"rotor\"[1] to create friction.[2] This action slows the rotation of a shaft, such as a vehicle axle, either to reduce its rotational speed or to hold it stationary. The energy of motion is converted into waste heat which must be dispersed.","image":"Disk_brake_dsc03682.jpg.webp","url":"Disc_brake"}
