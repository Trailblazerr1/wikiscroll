{"title":"Fear of a Black Planet","summary":"Fear of a Black Planet is the third studio album by American hip hop group Public Enemy. It was released on April 10, 1990, by Def Jam Recordings and Columbia Records, and produced by the group's production team The Bomb Squad, who expanded on the sample-layered sound of Public Enemy's 1988 album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. Having fulfilled their initial creative ambitions with that album, the group aspired to create what lead rapper Chuck D called \"a deep, complex album\". Their songwriting was partly inspired by the controversy surrounding member Professor Griff and his dismissal from the group in 1989.","image":"Fear_of_a_Black_Planet.jpg.webp","url":"Fear_of_a_Black_Planet"}
