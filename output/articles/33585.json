{"title":"PGA European Tour","summary":"The PGA European Tour is an organisation which operates the three leading men's professional golf tours in Europe: the elite European Tour (currently known as the DP World Tour for sponsorships reasons),[1] which is the principal golf tour in Europe; the European Senior Tour, for players aged fifty or older; and the developmental Challenge Tour. Its headquarters are at Wentworth Club in Virginia Water, Surrey, England. The European Tour was established by the British-based Professional Golfers' Association through the 1970s, and responsibility was transferred to an independent PGA European Tour organisation in 1984.[2]","image":"Golf_current_event.svg.png.webp","url":"PGA_European_Tour"}
