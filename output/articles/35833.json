{"title":"Prehistoric religion","summary":"Prehistoric religion is the religious practice of prehistoric cultures. Prehistory, the period before written records, makes up the bulk of human experience; over 99% of human history occurred during the Paleolithic alone. Prehistoric cultures spanned the globe and existed for over two and a half million years; their religious practices were many and varied, and the study of them difficult due to the lack of written records describing the details of their faiths.","image":"Venus_of_Laussel_plate_(1915).jpg.webp"}
