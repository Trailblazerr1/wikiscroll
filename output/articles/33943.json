{"title":"Park Avenue Viaduct","summary":"The Park Avenue Viaduct, also known as the Pershing Square Viaduct, is a roadway in Manhattan in New York City.  It carries vehicular traffic on Park Avenue from 40th to 46th Streets around Grand Central Terminal and the MetLife Building, then through the Helmsley Building. All three buildings lie across the northâ€“south line of the avenue. The viaduct itself is composed of two sections: a steel viaduct with two roadways from 40th to 42nd Streets, and a pair of roadways between 42nd and 46th Streets. The street-level service roads of Park Avenue, which flank the viaduct between 40th and 42nd Streets, are called Pershing Square.","image":"GCT_PAV_2.jpg.webp","url":"Park_Avenue_Viaduct"}
