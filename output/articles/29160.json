{"title":"Medical prescription","summary":"A prescription, often abbreviated ℞ or Rx, is a formal communication from a physician or other registered health-care professional to a pharmacist, authorizing them to dispense a specific prescription drug for a specific patient. Historically, it was a physician's instruction to an apothecary listing the materials to be compounded into a treatment—the symbol ℞ (a capital letter R, crossed to indicate abbreviation) comes from the first word of a medieval prescription, Latin: Recipere (Take thou), that gave the list of the materials to be compounded.","image":"Printed_℞.jpg.webp","url":"Medical_prescription"}
