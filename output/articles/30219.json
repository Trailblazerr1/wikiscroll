{"title":"Modern Paganism","summary":"Modern Paganism, also known as Contemporary Paganism[1] and Neopaganism,[2] is a collective term for religious movements influenced by or derived from the various historical pagan beliefs of pre-modern peoples. Although they share similarities, contemporary Pagan religious movements are diverse, and do not share a single set of beliefs, practices, or texts.[3] Most academics who study the phenomenon treat it as a movement that is divided into different religions; others characterize it as a single religion of which different Pagan faiths are denominations.","image":"Sveriges_Asatrosamfunds_h√∂stblot_2009.jpg.webp","url":"Modern_Paganism"}
