{"title":"Phloem","summary":"Phloem (/ˈfloʊ.əm/, FLOH-əm) is the living tissue in vascular plants that transports the soluble organic compounds made during photosynthesis and known as photosynthates, in particular the sugar sucrose,[1] to parts of the plant where needed. This transport process is called translocation.[2] In trees, the phloem is the innermost layer of the bark, hence the name, derived from the Ancient Greek word φλοιός (phloiós), meaning \"bark\".[3][4] The term was introduced by Carl Nägeli in 1858.[5][6]","image":"Xylem_and_phloem_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Phloem"}
