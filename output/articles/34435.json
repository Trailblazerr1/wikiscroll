{"title":"Peranakans","summary":"The Peranakans (/pəˈrɑːnəˌkɑːn, -kən/), often referred to as the Straits Chinese or Straits–born Chinese, are an ethnic group defined by their genealogical descent from the first waves of Southern Chinese settlers to maritime Southeast Asia, known as Nanyang (Chinese: 南洋; pinyin: nán yáng; lit. 'Southern Ocean'), namely the ports in the Malay Peninsula, the Indonesian Archipelago as well as Singapore.[5][6] Peranakan culture, especially in the dominant Peranakan centres of Malacca, Singapore, Penang and Medan, is characterized by its unique hybridization of ancient Chinese culture with the local cultures of the Nusantara region, the result of a centuries-long history of transculturation and interracial marriage.","image":"Wedding_portrait_of_a_Peranakan_couple.jpg.webp"}
