{"title":"Shabbat","summary":"Shabbat (/ʃəˈbæt/, /ʃəˈbɑːt/, or /ʃəˈbʌt/; Hebrew: שַׁבָּת‎, romanized: Šabat, [ʃa'bat], lit. 'rest' or 'cessation') or the Sabbath, also called Shabbos (Yiddish: שבת‎) by Ashkenazim, is Judaism's day of rest on the seventh day of the week—i.e., Saturday. On this day, religious Jews remember the biblical stories describing the creation of the heaven and earth in six days and the redemption from slavery and The Exodus from Egypt, and look forward to a future Messianic Age. Since the Jewish religious calendar counts days from sunset to sunset, Shabbat begins in the evening of what on the civil calendar is Friday.","image":"Shabbat_Candles.jpg.webp","url":"Shabbat"}
