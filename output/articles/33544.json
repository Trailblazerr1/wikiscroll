{"title":"Oyo Empire","summary":"The Oyo Empire was a powerful Yoruba empire of Yorubaland made up of parts of present-day eastern Benin and western Nigeria (including Southwest zone and the western half of Northcentral zone). It grew to become the largest Yoruba-speaking state and rose through the outstanding organizational and administrative skills of the Yoruba people, wealth gained from trade, and a powerful cavalry. The Oyo Empire was one of the most politically important states in the entirety of Western Africa from the mid-7th to the late 18th century,[2] and held sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Yorubaland, but also over nearby African states, notably the Fon Kingdom of Dahomey in the modern Republic of Benin on its west.","image":"Oyo_Empire_at_Its_Greatest_Extent%2C_c._1780_(5).jpg.webp","url":"Oyo_Empire"}
