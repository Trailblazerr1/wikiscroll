{"title":"To Autumn","summary":"\"To Autumn\" is a poem by English Romantic poet John Keats (31 October 1795 â€“ 23 February 1821).   The work was composed on 19 September 1819 and published in 1820 in a volume of Keats's poetry that included Lamia and The Eve of St. Agnes. \"To Autumn\" is the final work in a group of poems known as Keats's \"1819 odes\". Although personal problems left him little time to devote to poetry in 1819, he composed \"To Autumn\" after a walk near Winchester one autumnal evening. The work marks the end of his poetic career, as he needed to earn money and could no longer devote himself to the lifestyle of a poet.  A little over a year after the publication of \"To Autumn\", Keats died in Rome.","image":"A_Day_with_Keats%2C_Neatby_plate_-_Autumn.png.webp"}
