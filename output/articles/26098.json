{"title":"Liege & Lief","summary":"Liege & Lief is the fourth album by the British folk rock band Fairport Convention. It is the third album the group released in the UK during 1969, all of which prominently feature Sandy Denny as lead female vocalist (Denny did not appear on the group's 1968 debut album), as well as the first to feature future long-serving personnel Dave Swarbrick and Dave Mattacks on violin/mandolin and drums, respectively, as full band members (Swarbrick had previously guested on Unhalfbricking). It is also the first Fairport album on which all songs are either adapted (freely) from traditional British and Celtic folk material (for example \"Matty Groves\", \"Tam Lin\"), or else are original compositions (such as \"Come All Ye\", \"Crazy Man Michael\") written and performed in a similar style. Although Denny (and also the founding member the bass player Ashley Hutchings) quit the band even before the album's release, Fairport Convention has continued to the present day to make music strongly based within the British folk rock idiom, and are still the band most prominently associated with it.","image":"Fairport_Convention-Liege_%26_Lief_(album_cover).jpg.webp","url":"Liege_&_Lief"}
