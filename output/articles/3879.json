{"title":"Anthocyanin","summary":"Anthocyanins (also anthocyans; from Greek: ἄνθος (anthos) \"flower\" and κυάνεος/κυανοῦς kyaneos/kyanous \"dark blue\") are water-soluble vacuolar pigments that, depending on their pH, may appear red, purple, blue, or black. In 1835, the German pharmacist Ludwig Clamor Marquart gave the name Anthokyan to a chemical compound that gives flowers a blue color for the first time in his treatise “Die Farben der Blüthen”. Food plants rich in anthocyanins include the blueberry, raspberry, black rice, and black soybean, among many others that are red, blue, purple, or black. Some of the colors of autumn leaves are derived from anthocyanins.[1][2]","image":"Purplec.png.webp"}
