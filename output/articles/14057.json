{"title":"Eastern wolf","summary":"The eastern wolf (Canis lupus lycaon[2][3] or Canis lycaon[4]) also known as the timber wolf,[5] Algonquin wolf or eastern timber wolf,[6] is a canine of debated taxonomy native to the Great Lakes region and southeastern Canada. It is considered to be either a unique subspecies of gray wolf or a separate species from the gray wolf.[7] Many studies have found the eastern wolf  to be the product of ancient and recent genetic admixture between the gray wolf and the coyote,[8][9] while other studies have found some or all populations of the eastern wolf, as well as coyotes, originally separated from a common ancestor with the wolf over 1 million years ago and that these populations of the eastern wolf may be the same species as or a closely related species to the red wolf (Canis lupus rufus or Canis rufus) of the Southeastern United States.[10][11][7]  Regardless of its status, it is regarded as unique and therefore worthy of conservation[12] with Canada citing the population in eastern Canada (also known as the \"Algonquin wolf\")  as being the eastern wolf population subject to protection.[13]","image":"Eastern-wolf.jpg.webp"}
