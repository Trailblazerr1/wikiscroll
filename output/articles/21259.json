{"title":"Hydrosphere","summary":"The hydrosphere (from Greek ὕδωρ hydōr, \"water\"[1] and σφαῖρα sphaira, \"sphere\"[2]) is the combined mass of water found on, under, and above the surface of a planet, minor planet, or natural satellite. Although Earth's hydrosphere has been around for about 4 billion years,[3][4] it continues to change in shape. This is caused by seafloor spreading and continental drift, which rearranges the land and ocean.[5]","image":"Iss007e10807.jpg.webp","url":"Hydrosphere"}
