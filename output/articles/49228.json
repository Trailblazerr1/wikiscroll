{"title":"Yield curve","summary":"In finance, the yield curve is a graph which depicts how the yields on debt instruments - such as bonds - vary as a function of their years remaining to maturity.[1][2] Typically, the graph's horizontal or x-axis is a time line of months or years remaining to maturity, with the shortest maturity on the left and progressively longer time periods on the right. The vertical or y-axis depicts the annualized yield to maturity.[3]","image":"Yield_curve_20180513.png.webp","url":"Yield_curve"}
