{"title":"DMC DeLorean","summary":"The DMC DeLorean (often referred to as the \"DeLorean\") is a rear-engine, two-door, two-passenger sports car manufactured and marketed by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) for the American market from 1981 until 1983â€”ultimately the only car brought to market by the fledgling company. The DeLorean is sometimes referred to by its internal DMC pre-production designation, DMC-12.[10][11][12] However, the DMC-12 name was never used in sales or marketing material for the production model.","image":"Delorean_DMC-12_side.jpg.webp","url":"DMC_DeLorean"}
