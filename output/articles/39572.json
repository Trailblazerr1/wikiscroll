{"title":"Scapa Flow","summary":"Scapa Flow (/ˈskɑːpə, ˈskæpə/; from Old Norse  Skalpaflói 'bay of the long isthmus')[1] is a body of water in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, sheltered by the islands of Mainland, Graemsay, Burray,[2] South Ronaldsay and Hoy. Its sheltered waters have played an important role in travel, trade and conflict throughout the centuries. Vikings anchored their longships in Scapa Flow more than a thousand years ago. It was the United Kingdom's chief naval base during the First and Second World Wars, but the facility was closed in 1956.","image":"Scotland_relief_location_map.jpg.webp","url":"Scapa_Flow"}
