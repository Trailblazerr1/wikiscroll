Completed in 1933, the 66-story, 850 ft (260 m) building was designed in the Art Deco style by Raymond Hood, Rockefeller Center's lead architect. 30 Rockefeller Center was formerly known as the RCA Building from its opening to 1988 and as the GE Building from 1988 to 2015.

The building's name is sometimes shortened to 30 Rock, a nickname that inspired an NBC sitcom of the same name.","image":"GE_Building_Oct_2005.jpg.webp","url":"30_Rockefeller_Plaza"}
