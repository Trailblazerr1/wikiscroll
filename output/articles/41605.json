{"title":"Spanish architecture","summary":"Spanish architecture refers to architecture in any area of what is now Spain, and by Spanish architects worldwide. The term includes buildings which were constructed within the current borders of Spain prior to its existence as a nation, when the land was called Iberia, Hispania, or was divided between several Christian and Muslim kingdoms. Spanish architecture demonstrates great historical and geographical diversity, depending on the historical period.[1] It developed along similar lines as other architectural styles around the Mediterranean and from Northern Europe, although some Spanish constructions are unique.","image":"Palacio_Real_1.jpg.webp"}
