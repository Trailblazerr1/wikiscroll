{"title":"Eliminative materialism","summary":"Eliminative materialism (also called eliminativism)  is a materialist position in the philosophy of mind. It is the idea that the majority of the mental states in modern psychology do not exist. [1] Some supporters of eliminativism argue that no coherent neural basis will be found for many everyday psychological concepts such as belief or desire, since they are poorly defined. Rather, they argue that psychological concepts of behaviour and experience should be judged by how well they reduce to the biological level.[2] Other versions entail the non-existence of conscious mental states such as pain and visual perceptions.[3]","image":"Cellarius_ptolemaic_system.jpg.webp","url":"Eliminative_materialism"}
