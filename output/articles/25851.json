{"title":"Leishmaniasis","summary":"Leishmaniasis is a wide array of clinical manifestations caused by parasites of the trypanosome genus Leishmania.[7] It is generally spread through the bite of phlebotomine sandflies, Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia, and occurs most frequently in the tropics and sub-tropics of Africa, Asia, the Americas, and southern Europe.[2][7] The disease can present in three main ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral.[2] The cutaneous form presents with skin ulcers, while the mucocutaneous form presents with ulcers of the skin, mouth, and nose. The visceral form starts with skin ulcers and later presents with fever, low count of red blood cells, and enlarged spleen and liver.[2][3]","image":"Skin_ulcer_due_to_leishmaniasis%2C_hand_of_Central_American_adult_3MG0037_lores.jpg.webp","url":"Leishmaniasis"}
