{"title":"Malaysian language","summary":"The Malaysian language (Malay: bahasa Malaysia, Jawi: بهاس مليسيا‎) or Malaysian Malay (Malay: bahasa Melayu Malaysia), is the name regularly applied to the standardized form of Malay language used in Malaysia (as opposed to the variety used in Indonesia, which is referred to as the \"Indonesian\" language). Constitutionally, however, the official language of Malaysia is stated as \"Malay\", but the term \"Malaysian\" or Bahasa Malaysia is used on official contexts from time to time. Malaysian is standardized from the Johore-Riau dialect of Malay. It is spoken by much of the Malaysian population, although most learn a vernacular form of Malay or another native language first.[1] Malay is a compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools.[3]","image":"Flag_of_Malaysia.svg.png.webp","url":"Malaysian_language"}
