{"title":"Ford Transit","summary":"The Ford Transit, also known as the Ford T-Series in some markets, is a family of light commercial vehicles manufactured by Ford since 1965, originally based on the FR layout, and now in its fourth generation. Sold primarily as a cargo van, the Transit is also built as a passenger van (marketed as the Ford Tourneo since 1995), minibus, cutaway van chassis, and as a pickup truck. Over 8,000,000 Transit vans have been sold, making it the third best-selling van of all time[1] and have been produced across four basic platform generations (debuting in 1965, 1986, 2000, and 2013 respectively), with various \"facelift\" versions of each.","image":"2016_Ford_Transit_350_2.2.jpg.webp"}
