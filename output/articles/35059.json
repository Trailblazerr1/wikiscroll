{"title":"Piper cubeba","summary":"Piper cubeba, cubeb or tailed pepper is a plant in genus Piper, cultivated for its fruit and essential oil. It is mostly grown in Java and Sumatra, hence sometimes called Java pepper. The fruits are gathered before they are ripe, and carefully dried. Commercial cubeb consists of the dried berries, similar in appearance to black pepper, but with stalks attached â€“ the \"tails\" in \"tailed pepper\".  The dried pericarp is wrinkled, and its color ranges from grayish brown to black. The seed is hard, white and oily. The odor of cubeb is described as agreeable and aromatic and the taste as pungent, acrid, slightly bitter and persistent.  It has been described as tasting like allspice, or like a cross between allspice and black pepper.[1]","image":"Piper_cubeba_muda.jpg.webp"}
