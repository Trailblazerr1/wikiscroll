{"title":"Monolith","summary":"A monolith is a geological feature consisting of a single massive stone or rock, such as some mountains. For instance, Savandurga mountain is a monolith mountain in India. Erosion usually exposes the geological formations, which are often made of very hard and solid igneous or metamorphic rock. Some monoliths are volcanic plugs, solidified lava filling the vent of an extinct volcano.","image":"Uluru%2C_helicopter_view%2C_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Monolith"}
