{"title":"When Love Takes Over","summary":"\"When Love Takes Over\" is a song by French DJ-music producer David Guetta with vocals by Kelly Rowland from his fourth studio album, One Love. It was released as the lead single from the album on 21 April 2009 by Virgin Records (EMI France). The song was conceived when Guetta played the instrumental version during one of his DJ sets in summer 2008; American recording artist Kelly Rowland, who fell in love with the track, convinced Guetta to allow her to take it so that she could write and record vocals for it. It was co-written by Nervo.","image":"When_Love_Takes_Over.jpg.webp","url":"When_Love_Takes_Over"}
