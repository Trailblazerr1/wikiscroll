{"title":"Van der Waals radius","summary":"The Van der Waals radius, rw, of an atom is the radius of an imaginary hard sphere representing the distance of closest approach for another atom. \nIt is named after Johannes Diderik van der Waals, winner of the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physics, as he was the first to recognise that atoms were not simply points and to demonstrate the physical consequences of their size through the Van der Waals equation of state.","image":"4decd5fa28f367b0fbdc8cb85d9c22d2b1a934e2.svg"}
