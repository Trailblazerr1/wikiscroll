{"title":"Rotten Tomatoes","summary":"Rotten Tomatoes is an American review-aggregation website for film and television. The company was launched in August 1998 by three undergraduate students at the University of California, Berkeley: Senh Duong, Patrick Y. Lee, and Stephen Wang.[5][6][7][8] Although the name \"Rotten Tomatoes\" connects to the practice of audiences throwing rotten tomatoes when disapproving of a poor stage performance, the original inspiration comes from a scene featuring tomatoes in the Canadian film LÃ©olo (1992).[9]","image":"Rotten_Tomatoes_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Rotten_Tomatoes"}
