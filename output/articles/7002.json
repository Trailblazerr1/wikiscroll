{"title":"Bluegrass music","summary":"Bluegrass music is a genre of American roots music that developed in the 1940s in the United States Appalachian region.[1] The genre derives its name from the band Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys.[2] Unlike mainstream country music, bluegrass is traditionally played on acoustic stringed instruments. Bluegrass has roots in traditional English, Scottish and Irish ballads and dance tunes, and in traditional African-American blues and jazz.[3]  Bluegrass was further developed by musicians who played with Monroe, including 5-string banjo player Earl Scruggs and guitarist Lester Flatt. Monroe characterized the genre as: \"Scottish bagpipes and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and jazz, and it has a high lonesome sound.\"[4]","image":"BluegrassBanjo.jpg.webp"}
