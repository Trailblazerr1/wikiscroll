{"title":"His Master's Voice","summary":"His Master's Voice (HMV) was the name of a major British record label created in 1901 by The Gramophone Co. Ltd.[1] The phrase was coined in the late 1890s as the title of a painting depicting a terrier-mix dog named Nipper listening to a wind-up disc gramophone and tilting his head.[2][3] In the original, unmodified 1898 painting, the dog was listening to a cylinder phonograph. The painting was also a famous trademark and logo of the Victor Talking Machine Company, later known as RCA Victor.","image":"His_Master's_Voice.jpg.webp","url":"His_Master's_Voice"}
