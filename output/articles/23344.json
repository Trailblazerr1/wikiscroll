{"title":"Jesus in Christianity","summary":"In Christianity, Jesus is the Son of God and in many mainstream Christian denominations he is God the Son, the second Person in the Trinity. He is believed to be the Jewish messiah (Christ) who is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible, which is called the Old Testament in Christianity. Jesus preached, taught in parables, and gathered disciples. It is believed that through his crucifixion and subsequent resurrection, God offered humans salvation and eternal life,[1] that Jesus died to atone for sin to make humanity right with God.[2]","image":"Ottavio_vannini%2C_san_giovanni_che_indica_il_Cristo_a_Sant'Andrea.jpg.webp","url":"Jesus_in_Christianity"}
