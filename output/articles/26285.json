{"title":"Linotype machine","summary":"The Linotype machine (/ˈlaɪnətaɪp/ LYNE-ə-type) is a \"line casting\" machine used in printing sold by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies.[1] It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype became one of the mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines, and posters from the late 19th century to the 1970s and 1980s,[1] when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting and computer typesetting. The name of the machine comes from the fact that it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e., manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and shallow subdivided trays, called \"cases\".","image":"Linotype-vorne-deutsches-museum-annotated.jpg.webp"}
