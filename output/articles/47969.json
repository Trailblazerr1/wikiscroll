{"title":"Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia","summary":"The Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, officially known as Operation Danube, was a joint invasion of Czechoslovakia by four Warsaw Pact countries (the Soviet Union, Poland, Bulgaria and Hungary) on the night of 20–21 August 1968.[20] Approximately 500,000[7] Warsaw Pact troops attacked Czechoslovakia that night, with Romania and Albania refusing to participate.[21][22] East German forces, except for a small number of specialists, did not participate in the invasion because they were ordered from Moscow not to cross the Czechoslovak border just hours before the invasion.[23] 137 Czechoslovakian civilians were killed[17] and 500 seriously wounded during the occupation.[18]","image":"František_Dostál_Srpen_1968_4_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
