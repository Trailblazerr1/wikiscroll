{"title":"North Africa","summary":"North Africa or Northern Africa is a region encompassing the northern portion of the African continent. There is no singularly accepted scope for the region, and it is sometimes defined as stretching from the Atlantic shores of Mauritania in the west, to Egypt's Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the east. Varying sources limit it to the countries of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia, a region that was known by the French during colonial times as \"Afrique du Nord\" and is known by Arabs as the Maghreb (\"West\", The western part of Arab World).[1] The United Nations definition includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, and the Western Sahara, the territory disputed between Morocco and the Sahrawi Republic.[4] The African Union definition includes the Western Sahara and Mauritania but not Sudan.[5] When used in the term Middle East and North Africa (MENA), it often refers only to the countries of the Maghreb.","image":"North_Africa_(orthographic_projection).svg.png.webp","url":"North_Africa"}
