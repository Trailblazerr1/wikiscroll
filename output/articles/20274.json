{"title":"Higgs boson","summary":"The Higgs boson is an elementary particle in the Standard Model of particle physics produced by the quantum excitation of the Higgs field,[8][9] one of the fields in particle physics theory.[9] In the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a massive scalar boson with zero spin, no electric charge, and no colour charge. It is also very unstable, decaying into other particles almost immediately.","image":"Candidate_Higgs_Events_in_ATLAS_and_CMS.png.webp","url":"Higgs_boson"}
