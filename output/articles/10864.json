{"title":"Condensation reaction","summary":"In organic chemistry, a condensation reaction is a type of chemical reaction in which two molecules are combined to form a single molecule, usually with the loss of a small molecule such as water.[1] If water is lost, the reaction is also known as a dehydration synthesis. However other molecules can also be lost, such as ammonia, ethanol, acetic acid and hydrogen sulfide.[2]","image":"AminoacidCondensation.svg.png.webp","url":"Condensation_reaction"}
