{"title":"Theology of Huldrych Zwingli","summary":"The theology of Ulrich Zwingli was based on an interpretation of the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired word of God and placing its authority higher than what he saw as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration, noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.","image":"Ulrich_Zwingli_by_Hans_Asper_1531.jpg.webp","url":"Theology_of_Huldrych_Zwingli"}
