{"title":"Electra Heart","summary":"Electra Heart is the second studio album by Welsh singer Marina Diamandis, released under the stage name Marina and the Diamonds. It was released on 27 April 2012 by 679 Artists and Atlantic Records. Diamandis collaborated with producers including Liam Howe, Greg Kurstin, Dr. Luke, Diplo and Stargate during its recording, and subsequently transitioned from the new wave musical styles seen throughout her debut studio album, The Family Jewels (2010). Their efforts resulted in a concept album consisting of electropop, dance-pop, and hyperpop music, a distinct departure from her earlier projects. Lyrically, the album discusses topics of love and identity. Diamandis created the title character \"Electra Heart\" to represent female archetypes in popular American culture (House Wife, Beauty Queen, Homewrecker and Idle Teen).","image":"Marina_and_the_Diamonds_-_Electra_Heart.png.webp"}
