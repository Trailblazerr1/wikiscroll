{"title":"Interstate 295 (Delaware–Pennsylvania)","summary":"Interstate 295 (I-295) in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, designated as a bypass around Philadelphia and a partial beltway of Trenton, New Jersey. The route begins at a junction with I-95 south of Wilmington, Delaware, and runs to an interchange with I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania. The highway heads east from I-95 and crosses the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Delaware Memorial Bridge concurrent with U.S. Route 40 (US 40). Upon entering New Jersey, I-295 splits from the New Jersey Turnpike and US 40, and runs parallel to the turnpike for most of its course in the state. After a concurrency with US 130 in Gloucester County, I-295 has an interchange with I-76 and Route 42 in Camden County. The freeway continues northeast toward Trenton, where it intersects I-195 and Route 29 before bypassing the city to the east, north, and west, crossing the Delaware River on the Scudder Falls Bridge into Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, I-295 is signed as an east–west road and heads south to its other terminus at I-95. I-295 is one of two three-digit interstates in the United States to enter three states, with the other one being the I-275 beltway around Cincinnati which enters Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.","image":"I-295.svg.png.webp","url":"Interstate_295_(Delaware–Pennsylvania)"}
