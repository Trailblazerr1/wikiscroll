{"title":"Lock (water navigation)","summary":"A lock is a device used for raising and lowering boats, ships and other watercraft between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways. The distinguishing feature of a lock is a fixed chamber in which the water level can be varied; whereas in a caisson lock, a boat lift, or on a canal inclined plane, it is the chamber itself (usually then called a caisson) that rises and falls.","image":"Lock_and_cottage_on_Aylesbury_Arm_of_Grand_Union_-_geograph.org.uk_-_112420.jpg.webp","url":"Lock_(water_navigation)"}
