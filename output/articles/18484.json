{"title":"Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.","summary":"Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc., 593 U.S. ___ (2021),[1] was a legal case within the United States related to the nature of computer code and copyright law. The dispute centered on the use of parts of the Java programming language's application programming interfaces (APIs) and about 11,000 lines of source code, which are owned by Oracle (through subsidiary, Oracle America, Inc., originating from Sun Microsystems), within early versions of the Android operating system by Google. Google has since transitioned Android to a copyright-unburdened engine without the source code, and has admitted to using the APIs but claimed this was within fair use.","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp","url":"Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc."}
