{"title":"Livestock","summary":"Livestock are the domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to provide labor and produce commodities such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, and wool. The term is sometimes used to refer solely to animals that are raised for consumption, and sometimes used to refer solely to farmed ruminants, such as cattle, sheep and goats.[1] Horses are considered livestock in the United States.[2] The USDA classifies pork, veal, beef, and lamb (mutton) as livestock, and all livestock as red meat. Poultry and fish are not included in the category.[3]","image":"20150728_xl_P1000804_Leck_mich_Zaertlichkeit_der_Rinder.JPG.webp","url":"Livestock"}
