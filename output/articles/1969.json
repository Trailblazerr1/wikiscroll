{"title":"Abu Simbel","summary":"Abu Simbel is two massive rock-cut temples in the village of Abu Simbel (Arabic: أبو سمبل‎), Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt, near the border with Sudan. They are situated on the western bank of Lake Nasser, about 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road). The complex is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Nubian Monuments\",[1] which run from Abu Simbel downriver to Philae (near Aswan), and include Amada, Wadi es-Sebua, and other Nubian sites. The twin temples were originally carved out of the mountainside in the 13th century BC, during the 19th Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Ramesses II. They serve as a lasting monument to the king Ramesses II. His wife  Nefertari and children can be seen in smaller figures by his feet, considered to be of lesser importance and were not given the same position of scale. This  commemorates his victory at the Battle of Kadesh. Their huge external rock relief figures have become iconic.","image":"Ramsis%2C_Aswan_Governorate%2C_Egypt_-_panoramio.jpg.webp"}
