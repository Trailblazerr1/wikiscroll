{"title":"Grubbs catalyst","summary":"Grubbs catalysts are a series of transition metal carbene complexes used as catalysts for olefin metathesis. They are named after Robert H. Grubbs, the chemist who supervised their synthesis. Several generations of the catalyst have been developed.[1][2] Grubbs catalysts tolerate many functional groups in the alkene substrates, are air-tolerant, and are compatible with a wide range of solvents.[3][4] For these reasons, Grubbs catalysts have become popular in synthetic organic chemistry.[5] Grubbs, together with Richard R. Schrock and Yves Chauvin, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in recognition of their contributions to the development of olefin metathesis.","image":"Grubbs_Catalyst_1st_Generation.svg.png.webp"}
