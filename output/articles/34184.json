{"title":"Paul Kruger","summary":"Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (Afrikaans pronunciation: [ˈkry.ər]; 10 October 1825 – 14 July 1904) was a South African politician. He was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century South Africa, and President of the South African Republic (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed Oom Paul (\"Uncle Paul\"), he came to international prominence as the face of the Boer cause—that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the Orange Free State—against Britain during the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. He has been called a personification of Afrikanerdom, and remains a controversial figure; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero.","image":"KrugerPaulusJohannes.jpg.webp"}
