{"title":"Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe","summary":"The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (TCE; commonly referred to as the European Constitution or as the Constitutional Treaty) was an unratified international treaty intended to create a consolidated constitution for the European Union (EU). It would have replaced the existing European Union treaties with a single text, given legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and expanded Qualified Majority Voting into policy areas which had previously been decided by unanimity among member states.","image":"ConstitutionEurope.jpg.webp","url":"Treaty_establishing_a_Constitution_for_Europe"}
