{"title":"History of the Yosemite area","summary":"Human habitation in the Sierra Nevada region of California reaches back  8,000 to 10,000 years ago.[1] Historically attested Native American populations, such as the Sierra Miwok, Mono and Paiute, belong to the Uto-Aztecan and Utian phyla. In the mid-19th century, a band of Native Americans called the Ahwahnechee lived in Yosemite Valley. The California Gold Rush greatly increased the number of non-indigenous people in the region.  Tensions between Native Americans and white settlers escalated into the Mariposa War. As part of this conflict, settler James Savage led the Mariposa Battalion into Yosemite Valley in 1851, in pursuit of Ahwaneechees led by Chief Tenaya.  The California state military forces burned the tribe's villages, destroyed their food stores, killed the chief's sons, and forced the tribe out of Yosemite. Accounts from the Mariposa Battalion, especially from Dr.Â Lafayette Bunnell, popularized Yosemite Valley as a scenic wonder.","image":"Galen_Clark_in_the_Big_Tree_Grove.jpeg.webp"}
