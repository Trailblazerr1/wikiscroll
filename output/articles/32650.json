{"title":"Obituary","summary":"An obituary (obit for short) is a news article that reports the recent death of a prominent person.[1]  In national newspapers, editorial obituaries are written only for people considered significant.[1]  In local newspapers, an obituary may be published for any local resident upon death. A necrology is a register or list of records of the deaths of people related to a particular organization, group or field, which may only contain the sparsest details, or small obituaries.  Historical necrologies can be important sources of information.","image":"Louis_Julius_Freudenberg_I_(1894â€“1918)_composite_obituary_in_the_Hudson_Observer_on_November_22%2C_1918.jpg.webp"}
