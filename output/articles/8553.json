{"title":"Carbon dioxide","summary":"Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is an acidic colorless gas with a density about 53% higher than that of dry air.  Carbon dioxide molecules consist of a carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms. It occurs naturally in Earth's atmosphere as a trace gas. The current concentration is about 0.04% (412 ppm) by volume, having risen from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm.[10][11]  Natural sources include volcanoes, forest fires, hot springs, geysers, and it is freed from carbonate rocks by dissolution in water and acids. Because carbon dioxide is soluble in water, it occurs naturally in groundwater, rivers and lakes, ice caps, glaciers and seawater. It is present in deposits of petroleum and natural gas. Carbon dioxide has a sharp and acidic odor and generates the taste of soda water in the mouth.[12] However, at normally encountered concentrations it is odorless.[1]","image":"Carbon-dioxide-2D-dimensions.svg.png.webp"}
