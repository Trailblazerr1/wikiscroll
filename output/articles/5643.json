{"title":"Barrel vault","summary":"A barrel vault, also known as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault, is an architectural element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, in the case of a pointed barrel vault) along a given distance. The curves are typically circular in shape, lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design. The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault: effectively a series of arches placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of barrel roof.","image":"Temple_of_Jupiter%2C_Diocletians_Palace%2C_Split_(11944057914).jpg.webp","url":"Barrel_vault"}
