{"title":"Buddhism in Myanmar","summary":"Buddhism (Burmese: ထေရဝါဒဗုဒ္ဓဘာသာ) is practiced by nearly 90% of the population of Myanmar, and is predominantly of the Theravada tradition.[2][3] It is the most religious Buddhist country in terms of the proportion of monks in the population and proportion of income spent on religion.[4] Adherents are most likely found among the dominant Bamar people, Shan, Rakhine, Mon, Karen, and Chinese who are well integrated into Burmese society. Monks, collectively known as the sangha (community), are venerated members of Burmese society. Among many ethnic groups in Myanmar, including the Bamar and Shan, Theravada Buddhism is practiced in conjunction with the worship of nats, which are spirits who can intercede in worldly affairs.","image":"Shwedagon_Pagoda_2017.jpg.webp","url":"Buddhism_in_Myanmar"}
