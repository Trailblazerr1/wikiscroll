{"title":"Empty tomb","summary":"The empty tomb is the Christian tradition that women coming to the tomb of Jesus on the third day after his crucifixion found it empty.[1] The story is found in all four gospels, but beyond this basic outline they agree on little.[2] However, the whole death, burial, and resurrection narrative predates the gospels and Paul's letters via oral traditions.[3] The gospel authors' usage of standard literary, historical, and biographical compositional practices of their day along with their use of multiple sources account for much of the differences, which were usually over peripheral details.[3] Mark's Gospel, in its original ending, the women who discover the tomb flee, telling no one, after meeting a young man who he tells them that Jesus will meet the disciples in Galilee;[4] Matthew introduces guards and a curious doublet whereby the women are told twice, by angels and then by Jesus, that he will meet the disciples in Galilee;[5] Luke changes Mark's one \"young man\" to two, adds Peter's inspection of the tomb,[6] and deletes the promise that Jesus would meet his disciples in Galilee;[7] John reduces the women to the solitary Mary Magdalene and introduces the \"beloved disciple\" who visits the tomb with Peter and is the first to understand its significance.[8][9]","image":"PericopesHenryIIFol117rAngelOnTomb.jpg.webp","url":"Empty_tomb"}
