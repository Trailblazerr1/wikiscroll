{"title":"Royal Question","summary":"The Royal Question (French: Question royale, Dutch: Koningskwestie) was a major political crisis in Belgium that lasted from 1945 to 1951, coming to a head between March and August 1950. The \"question\" at stake surrounded whether King Leopold III could return to the country and resume his constitutional role amid allegations that his actions during World War II had been contrary to the provisions of the Belgian Constitution. It was eventually resolved by the abdication of Leopold in favour of his son Baudouin in 1951.","image":"Leopold_III_van_BelgiÃ«_(1934)_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
