{"title":"Extracellular fluid","summary":"In cell biology, extracellular fluid (ECF) denotes all body fluid outside the cells of any multicellular organism. Total body water in healthy adults is about 60% (range 45 to 75%) of total body weight; women and the obese typically have a lower percentage than lean men.[1] Extracellular fluid makes up about one-third of body fluid, the remaining two-thirds is intracellular fluid within cells.[2] The main component of the extracellular fluid is the interstitial fluid that surrounds cells.","image":"Cellular_Fluid_Content.jpg.webp","url":"Extracellular_fluid"}
