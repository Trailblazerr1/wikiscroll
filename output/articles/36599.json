{"title":"Pyroclastic flow","summary":"A pyroclastic flow (also known as a pyroclastic density current or a pyroclastic cloud)[1] is a fast-moving current of hot gas and volcanic matter (collectively known as tephra) that flows along the ground away from a volcano at average speeds of 100 km/h (62 mph) but is capable of reaching speeds up to 700 km/h (430 mph).[2] The gases and tephra can reach temperatures of about 1,000 °C (1,830 °F).","image":"Pyroclastic_flows_at_Mayon_Volcano.jpg.webp"}
