{"title":"Image file formats","summary":"Image file formats are standardized means of organizing and storing digital images. An image file format may store data in an uncompressed format, a compressed format (which may be lossless or lossy), or a vector format. Image files are composed of digital data in one of these formats so that the data can be rasterized for use on a computer display or printer. Rasterization converts the image data into a grid of pixels. Each pixel has a number of bits to designate its color (and in some formats, its transparency). Rasterizing an image file for a specific device takes into account the number of bits per pixel (the color depth) that the device is designed to handle.","image":"CC-BY_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Image_file_formats"}
