{"title":"Archaeology","summary":"Archaeology or archeology[lower-alpha 1] is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, sites, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities.[1][2] In Europe it is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines, while in North America archaeology is a sub-field of anthropology.[3]","image":"Nabonidus_cylinder_sippar_bm1.jpg.webp","url":"Archaeology"}
