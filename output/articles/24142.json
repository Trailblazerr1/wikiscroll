It is the third installment of the Jumanji franchise, after Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), and it is a direct sequel to Jumanji (1995), which was based on the 1981 children's book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg. The story focuses on a group of teenagers who come across Jumanji—now transformed into a video game—twenty-one years after the events of the 1995 film. They find themselves trapped in the game as a set of adult avatars, seeking to complete a quest alongside another player who has been trapped since 1996.","image":"Jumanji_Welcome_to_the_Jungle.png.webp"}
