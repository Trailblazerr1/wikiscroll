{"title":"Coastline paradox","summary":"The coastline paradox is the counterintuitive observation that the coastline of a landmass does not have a well-defined length. This results from the fractal curve-like properties of coastlines, i.e., the fact that a coastline typically has a fractal dimension (which in fact makes the notion of length inapplicable). The first recorded observation of this phenomenon was by Lewis Fry Richardson[1][2] and it was expanded upon by Benoit Mandelbrot.[3][4]","image":"Britain-fractal-coastline-100km.png.webp","url":"Coastline_paradox"}
