{"title":"Amorphous solid","summary":"In condensed matter physics and materials science, an amorphous (from the Greek a, without, morph√©, shape, form) or non-crystalline solid is a solid that lacks the long-range order that is characteristic of a crystal. In some older books, the term has been used synonymously with glass. Nowadays, \"glassy solid\" or \"amorphous solid\" is considered to be the overarching concept, and glass the more special case: glass is an amorphous solid stabilized below its glass transition temperature.[1] Polymers are often amorphous. Other types of amorphous solids include gels, thin films, and nanostructured materials such as glass.","image":"Bulk_Metallic_Glass_Sample.jpg.webp"}
