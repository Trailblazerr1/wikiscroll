{"title":"Dominican Order","summary":"The Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans (Latin: Ordo Praedicatorum; abbreviated OP), is a order of the Catholic Church founded in Toulouse, France, by the Spanish priest Saint Dominic. It was approved by Pope Honorius III via the papal bull Religiosam vitam on 22 December 1216. Members of the order, who are referred to as Dominicans, generally carry the letters OP after their names, standing for Ordinis Praedicatorum, meaning of the Order of Preachers. Membership in the order includes friars,[lower-alpha 2] nuns, active sisters, and affiliated lay or secular Dominicans (formerly known as tertiaries, though recently there has been a growing number of associates who are unrelated to the tertiaries).","image":"EscOrdendePredicadores2Wikipedia.png.webp"}
