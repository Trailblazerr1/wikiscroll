{"title":"Thermodynamic temperature","summary":"Thermodynamic temperature is a quantity defined in thermodynamics as distinct from kinetic theory or statistical mechanics. A thermodynamic temperature reading of zero is of particular importance for the third law of thermodynamics. By courtesy, it reported on the Kelvin scale of temperature in which the unit of measure is the kelvin (unit symbol: K). For comparison, a temperature of 295 K is equal to 21.85 °C and 71.33 °F.","image":"Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png.webp"}
