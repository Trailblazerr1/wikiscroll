{"title":"Thermal equilibrium","summary":"Two physical systems are in thermal equilibrium if there is no net flow of thermal energy between them when they are connected by a path permeable to heat.  Thermal equilibrium obeys the zeroth law of thermodynamics.  A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially uniform and temporally constant.","image":"Thermal_equilibrium_in_closed_system.png.webp","url":"Thermal_equilibrium"}
