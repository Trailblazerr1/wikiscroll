{"title":"Angular resolution","summary":"Angular resolution describes the ability of any image-forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye, to distinguish small details of an object, thereby making it a major determinant of image resolution.  It is used in optics applied to light waves, in antenna theory applied to radio waves, and in acoustics applied to sound waves.  The colloquial use of the term \"resolution\" often causes confusion; when a camera is said to have high resolution because of its good image quality, it actually has a low angular resolution (because the angular distance, or difference in angle, at which it can still resolve individual objects is low).  The closely related term spatial resolution refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to space, which is directly connected to angular resolution in imaging instruments.  The Rayleigh criterion shows that the minimum angular spread that can be resolved by an image forming system is limited by diffraction to the ratio of the wavelength of the waves to the aperture width.  For this reason, high resolution imaging systems such as astronomical telescopes, long distance telephoto camera lenses and radio telescopes have large apertures.","image":"Airy_disk_spacing_near_Rayleigh_criterion.png.webp","url":"Angular_resolution"}
