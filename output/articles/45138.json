{"title":"Tick","summary":"Ticks (suborder Ixodida) are parasitic arachnids that are part of the mite superorder Parasitiformes. Adult ticks are approximately 3 to 5Â mm in length depending on age, sex, species, and \"fullness\". Ticks are external parasites, living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. The timing of the origin of ticks is uncertain, though the oldest known tick fossils are from the Cretaceous period, around 100 million years old. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.","image":"Ixodus_ricinus_5x.jpg.webp"}
