{"title":"Scone, Scotland","summary":"Scone (/ˈskuːn/ (listen); Scottish Gaelic: Sgàin; Scots: Scuin) is a town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. The medieval town of Scone, which grew up around the monastery and royal residence, was abandoned in the early 19th century when the residents were removed and a new palace was built on the site by the Earl of Mansfield. Hence the modern village of Scone, and the medieval village of Old Scone, can often be distinguished.","image":"Perth_and_Kinross_Scone_Palace_2.jpg.webp","url":"Scone,_Scotland"}
