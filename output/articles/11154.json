{"title":"Coppicing","summary":"Coppicing is a traditional method of woodland management which exploits the capacity of many species of trees to put out new shoots from their stump or roots if cut down. In a coppiced wood, which is called a copse, young tree stems are repeatedly cut down to near ground level, resulting in a stool. New growth emerges, and after a number of years, the coppiced tree is harvested, and the cycle begins anew. Pollarding is a similar process carried out at a higher level on the tree in order to prevent grazing animals from eating new shoots.[1] Daisugi (台杉, where sugi refers to Japanese cedar), is a similar Japanese technique.[2][3]","image":"Coppice_stool.jpg.webp","url":"Coppicing"}
