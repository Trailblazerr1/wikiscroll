{"title":"Continental drift","summary":"Continental drift is the hypothesis that the Earth's continents have moved over geologic time relative to each other, thus appearing to have \"drifted\" across the ocean bed.[1] The speculation that continents might have 'drifted' was first put forward by Abraham Ortelius in 1596.  The concept was independently and more fully developed by Alfred Wegener  in 1912, but his hypothesis was rejected by many for lack of any motive mechanism.  Arthur Holmes later proposed mantle convection for that mechanism.  The idea of continental drift has since been subsumed into the science of plate tectonics, which studies the movement of the continents as they ride on plates of the Earth's lithosphere.[2]","image":"Abraham_Ortelius_by_Peter_Paul_Rubens.jpg.webp"}
