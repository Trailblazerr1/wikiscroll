{"title":"Differential geometry","summary":"Differential geometry is a mathematical discipline that studies the geometry of smooth shapes and smooth spaces, otherwise known as smooth manifolds, using the techniques of differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra and multilinear algebra. The field has its origins in the study of spherical geometry as far back as antiquity, as it relates to astronomy and the geodesy of the Earth, and later in the study of hyperbolic geometry by Lobachevsky. The simplest examples of smooth spaces are the plane and space curves and surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean space, and the study of these shapes formed the basis for development of modern differential geometry during the 18th century and the 19th century.","image":"Hyperbolic_triangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Differential_geometry"}
