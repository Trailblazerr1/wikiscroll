{"title":"Seyfert galaxy","summary":"Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of electromagnetic radiation) with very high surface brightnesses whose spectra reveal strong, high-ionisation emission lines,[1] but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable.[2]","image":"Circinus.galaxy.750pix.jpg.webp","url":"Seyfert_galaxy"}
