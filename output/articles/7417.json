{"title":"Brahmo Samaj","summary":"Brahmo Samaj (Bengali: ব্রাহ্ম সমাজ, romanized: Brahmô Sômaj, Bengali pronunciation: [bram.ho ʃɔ.b̤a]) is the societal component of Brahmoism, which began as a monotheistic reformist movement of the Hindu religion that appeared during the Bengal Renaissance. It is practised today mainly as the Adi Dharm after its eclipse in Bengal consequent to the exit of the Tattwabodini Sabha from its ranks in 1839. The first Brahmo Samaj was founded in 1861 at Lahore by Pandit Nobin Chandra Roy.","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp"}
