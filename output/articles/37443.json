{"title":"Reduced instruction set computer","summary":"In computer engineering, a reduced instruction-set computer (RISC) is a computer designed to simplify the individual instructions given to the computer in order to realise a task. Unlike the instructions given to a complex instruction-set computer (CISC), with a RISC computer, a task might require more instructions (code) in order to realise a task, because the individual instructions are written in simpler code, and implementing an instruction pipeline may be simpler.[1]","image":"KL_Sun_UltraSparc.jpg.webp"}
