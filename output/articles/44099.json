{"title":"The Dresden Dolls","summary":"The Dresden Dolls are an American musical duo from Boston, Massachusetts. Formed in 2000, the group consists of Amanda Palmer (lead vocals and piano; additional: keyboards, harmonica, ukulele) and Brian Viglione (drums and backing vocals; additional: guitar, bass guitar). The two describe their style as \"Brechtian punk cabaret\", a phrase invented by Palmer because she was \"terrified\" that the press would invent a name that \"would involve the word gothic\".[3] The Dresden Dolls are part of an underground dark cabaret movement that started gaining momentum in the early 2000s.","image":"Dresden_Dolls2.jpg.webp"}
