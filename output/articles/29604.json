{"title":"Mi último adiós","summary":"\"Mi último adiós\" (English: \"My Last Farewell\") is a poem written by Filipino propagandist and writer Dr. José Rizal before his execution by firing squad on December 30, 1896. The piece was one of the last notes he wrote before his death. Another that he had written was found in his shoe, but because the text was illegible, its contents remain a mystery.","image":"Mi_Ultimo_Adios_stanza_1.jpg.webp","url":"Mi_último_adiós"}
