{"title":"Freediving blackout","summary":"Freediving blackout, breath-hold blackout[1] or apnea blackout is a class of hypoxic blackout, a loss of consciousness caused by cerebral hypoxia towards the end of a breath-hold (freedive or dynamic apnea) dive, when the swimmer does not necessarily experience an urgent need to breathe and has no other obvious medical condition that might have caused it. It can be provoked by hyperventilating just before a dive, or as a consequence of the pressure reduction on ascent, or a combination of these. Victims are often established practitioners of breath-hold diving, are fit, strong swimmers and have not experienced problems before.[2][3][4] Blackout may also be referred to as a syncope or fainting.","image":"Oxygen-Haemoglobin_dissociation_curves.svg.png.webp"}
