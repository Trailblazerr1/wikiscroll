{"title":"River Trent","summary":"The River Trent is the third-longest river in the United Kingdom. Its source  is in Staffordshire on the southern edge of Biddulph Moor.  It flows through and drains most of the metropolitan central and northern Midlands south and east of its source north of Stoke-on-Trent. The river is known for dramatic flooding after storms and spring snowmelt, which in past times often caused the river to change course.","image":"RiverTrentNottingham.jpg.webp"}
