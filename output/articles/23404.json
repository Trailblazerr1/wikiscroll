{"title":"Jim Crow laws","summary":"Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States.[1] Other areas in the United States were also affected by formal and informal policies of segregation,[2] but many states outside the South had adopted laws, beginning in the late nineteenth century, that variously banned discrimination in public accommodations and voting.[3]  Southern laws were enacted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by white Southern Democrat-dominated state legislatures to disenfranchise and remove political and economic gains made by black people during the Reconstruction period.[4] Jim Crow laws were enforced until 1965.[5]","image":"ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg.webp","url":"Jim_Crow_laws"}
