{"title":"Nynorsk","summary":"Nynorsk (translates to “Modern Norwegian”, literally “New Norwegian”)[5] is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 12 May 1885, it became the state-sanctioned version of Ivar Aasen's standard Norwegian language (Norwegian: Landsmål) parallel to the Dano-Norwegian written language (Riksmål). Nynorsk became the name in 1929, and it is after a series of reforms still a variation which is closer to Landsmål, whereas Bokmål is closer to Riksmål and Danish.","image":"Flag_of_Norway.svg.png.webp"}
