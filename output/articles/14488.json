{"title":"Electronic oscillator","summary":"An electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave or a triangle wave.[1][2][3]  Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current (AC) signal.  They are widely used in many electronic devices ranging from simplest clock generators to digital instruments (like calculators) and complex computers and peripherals etc.[3]  Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games.[1]","image":"OpAmpHystereticOscillator.svg.png.webp"}
