{"title":"Rape culture","summary":"Rape culture is a sociological theory of a setting in which rape is pervasive and normalized due to societal attitudes about gender and sexuality.[1][2] Behaviors commonly associated with rape culture include victim blaming, slut-shaming, sexual objectification, trivializing rape, denial of widespread rape, refusing to acknowledge the harm caused by sexual violence, or some combination of these.[3][4] It has been used to describe and explain behavior within social groups, including prison rape and in conflict areas where war rape is used as psychological warfare. Entire societies have been alleged to be rape cultures.[5][6][7][8][9] It is associated with rape fantasy and rape pornography.","image":"(A)_Rape_rates_per_100000_population_2010-2012%2C_world.jpg.webp"}
