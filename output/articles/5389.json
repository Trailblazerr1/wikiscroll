{"title":"Baking powder","summary":"Baking powder is a dry chemical leavening agent, a mixture of a carbonate or bicarbonate and a weak acid. The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as cornstarch. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing carbon dioxide gas into a batter or dough through an acidâ€“base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus leavening the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder, which releases carbon dioxide at room temperature as soon as it is dampened, was  developed by food manufacturer Alfred Bird in England in 1843. The first double-acting baking powder, which releases some carbon dioxide when dampened, and later releases more of the gas when heated by baking, was first developed by Eben Norton Horsford in the U.S. in the 1860s.","image":"BakingPowder.jpg.webp"}
