{"title":"Electroplating","summary":"Electroplating is a general name for processes that produce a metal coating on a solid substrate through the reduction of cations of that metal by means of a direct electric current. The part to be coated acts as the cathode (negative electrode) of an electrolytic cell; the electrolyte is a solution of a salt of the metal to be coated; and the anode (positive electrode) is usually either a block of that metal, or of some inert conductive material.  The current is provided by an external power supply.","image":"PCB_copper_layer_electroplating_machine.jpg.webp"}
