{"title":"Meadow","summary":"A meadow is an open habitat, or field, vegetated by grasses, herbs, and other non-woody plants. Trees or shrubs may sparsely populate meadows, as long as these areas maintain an open character. Meadows may be naturally occurring or artificially created from cleared shrub or woodland. They can occur naturally under favourable conditions (see perpetual meadows), but they are often maintained by humans for the production of hay, fodder, or livestock.[1] Meadow habitats, as a group, are characterized as \"semi-natural grasslands\", meaning that they are largely composed of species native to the region, with only limited human intervention.","image":"Blumenwiese_bei_Obermaiselstein05.jpg.webp"}
