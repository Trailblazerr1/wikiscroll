{"title":"JEL classification codes","summary":"Articles in economics journals are usually classified according to JEL classification codes, which derive from the Journal of Economic Literature.  The JEL is published quarterly by the American Economic Association (AEA) and contains survey articles and information on recently published books and dissertations. The AEA maintains EconLit, a searchable data base of citations for articles, books, reviews, dissertations, and working papers classified by JEL codes for the years from 1969. A recent addition to EconLit is indexing of economics-journal articles from 1886 to 1968[1] parallel to the print series Index of Economic Articles.[2]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"JEL_classification_codes"}
