{"title":"Cell potency","summary":"Cell potential, based on the 2007 works of Hans R. Sch√∂ler \"The Potential of Stem Cells: An Inventory\",  is a cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types.[1][2][3] The more cell types a cell can differentiate into, the greater its potency. Potency is also described as the gene activation potential within a cell, which like a continuum, begins with totipotency to designate a cell with the most differentiation potential, pluripotency, multipotency, oligopotency, and finally unipotency.","image":"Stem_cells_diagram.png.webp","url":"Cell_potency"}
