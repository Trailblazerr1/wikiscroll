{"title":"Ivory","summary":"Ivory is a hard, white material from the tusks (traditionally from elephants) and teeth of animals, that consists mainly of dentine, one of the physical structures of teeth and tusks. The chemical structure of the teeth and tusks of mammals is the same, regardless of the species of origin.  The trade in certain teeth and tusks other than elephant is well established and widespread; therefore, \"ivory\" can correctly be used to describe any mammalian teeth or tusks of commercial interest which are large enough to be carved or scrimshawed.[1]","image":"Horn_Louvre_OA4069.jpg.webp","url":"Ivory"}
