{"title":"Pulp magazine","summary":"Pulp magazines (often referred to as \"the pulps\") were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the late 1950s. The term \"pulp\" derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called \"glossies\" or \"slicks\". The typical pulp magazine had 128 pages; it was 7 inches (18 cm) wide by 10 inches (25 cm) high, and 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) thick, with ragged, untrimmed edges.","image":"Spicy_Mystery_Stories_February_1936.jpg.webp"}
