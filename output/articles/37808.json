{"title":"Rhinoplasty","summary":"Rhinoplasty (Ancient Greek: ῥίς, romanized: rhī́s, nose + Ancient Greek: πλάσσειν, romanized: plássein, to shape), commonly known as a nose job, is a plastic surgery procedure for altering and reconstructing the nose. There are two types of plastic surgery used – reconstructive surgery that restores the form and functions of the nose and cosmetic surgery that changes the appearance of the nose. Reconstructive surgery seeks to resolve nasal injuries caused by various traumas including blunt, and penetrating trauma and trauma caused by blast injury. Reconstructive surgery also treats birth defects,[1] breathing problems, and failed primary rhinoplasties. Rhinoplasty may remove a bump, narrow nostril width, change the angle between the nose and the mouth, or address injuries, birth defects, or other problems that affect breathing, such as a deviated nasal septum or a sinus condition.","image":"Exposing_lower_lateral_cartilage_during_rhinoplasty.jpg.webp"}
