{"title":"Middle East","summary":"The Middle East (Arabic: الشرق الأوسط‎, ISO 233: ash-Sharq al-Awsat) is a geopolitical term[2] that commonly refers to the region spanning the Levant, Arabian Peninsula, Anatolia (including modern Turkey and Cyprus), Egypt, Iran and Iraq.  The term came into widespread usage as a replacement of the term Near East (as opposed to the Far East) beginning in the early 20th century. The term \"Middle East\" has led to some confusion over its changing definitions, and has been viewed by some to be discriminatory[3] or too Eurocentric.[4] The region includes the vast majority of the territories included in the closely associated definition of Western Asia, but without the Caucasus and including all of Egypt, and not just the Sinai Peninsula.","image":"Middle_East_(orthographic_projection).svg.png.webp","url":"Middle_East"}
