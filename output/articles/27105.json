{"title":"Little brown bat","summary":"The little brown bat or little brown myotis[3] (Myotis lucifugus)[1] is an endangered species of mouse-eared microbat found in North America. It has a small body size and glossy brown fur. It is similar in appearance to several other mouse-eared bats, including the Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and Arizona myotis, to which it is closely related. Despite its name, the little brown bat is not closely related to the big brown bat, which belongs to a different genus.","image":"Little_Brown_Myotis_(cropped).JPG.webp"}
