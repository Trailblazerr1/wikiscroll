Ltd. in 1915.[3][4][5][6] After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name (montre is French for a watch (timepiece)); it later became Rolex SA.[2][4][7][8] Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.[5][9][10]","image":"Rolex_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Rolex"}
