{"title":"Islamic schools and branches","summary":"Islamic schools and branches have different understandings of Islam. There are many different sects or denominations, schools of Islamic jurisprudence, and schools of Islamic theology, or aqidah (creed). Within Islamic groups themselves there may be differences, such as different orders (tariqa) within Sufism, and within Sunnī Islam different schools of theology (Aṯharī, Ashʿarī, Māturīdī) and jurisprudence (Ḥanafī, Mālikī, Shāfiʿī, Ḥanbalī).[1] Groups in Islam may be quite large (for example, Sunnīs) or relatively small in size (Ibadis, Zaydis, Ismailis). Differences between the groups may not be well known to Muslims outside of scholarly circles or may have induced enough passion to have resulted in political and religious violence (Barelvi, Deobandi, Salafism, Wahhabism). There are informal movements driven by ideas (such as Islamic modernism and Islamism) as well as organized groups with a governing body (Ahmadiyya, Nation of Islam). Some Islamic sects and groups regard certain others as deviant or not truly Muslim (Ahmadiyya, Alawites, Quranists). Some Islamic sects and groups date back to the early history of Islam between the 7th-9th centuries CE (Kharijites, Sunnīs, Shiʿas), whereas others have arisen much more recently (Islamic neo-traditionalism, liberalism and progressivism, Islamic modernism, Salafism and Wahhabism) or even in the 20th century (Nation of Islam). Still others were influential in their time but are not longer in existence (Kharijites, Muʿtazila, Murji'ah).","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp"}
