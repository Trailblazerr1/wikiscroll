{"title":"Otaku","summary":"Otaku (Japanese: おたく, オタク, or ヲタク) is a Japanese word that describes people with consuming interests, particularly in anime and manga. Its contemporary use originated with a 1983 essay by Akio Nakamori in Manga Burikko. Otaku may be used as a pejorative with its negativity stemming from a stereotypical view of otaku as social outcasts and the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, \"The Otaku Murderer\", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now identify themselves as otaku,[1] both in Japan and elsewhere. Out of 137,734 teens surveyed in Japan in 2013, 42.2% self-identified as a type of otaku.[1]","image":"Akihabara_picture.jpg.webp","url":"Otaku"}
