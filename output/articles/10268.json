{"title":"Climate","summary":"Climate is the long-term pattern of weather in an area, typically averaged over a period of 30 years.[1][2] More rigorously, it is the mean and variability of meteorological variables over a time spanning from months to millions of years.[1] Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, which includes the ocean, land, and ice on Earth.[1] The climate of a location is affected by its latitude/longitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents.","image":"ShipTracks_MODIS_2005may11.jpg.webp"}
