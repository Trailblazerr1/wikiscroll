{"title":"Yoni","summary":"Yoni (IAST: yoni; sometimes also IAST: yonī), sometimes referred to as pindika, is an abstract or aniconic representation of the Hindu goddess Shakti.[3][4] It is usually shown with linga – its masculine counterpart.[3][5] Together, they symbolize the merging of microcosmos and macrocosmos,[5] the divine eternal process of creation and regeneration, and the union of the feminine and the masculine that recreates all of existence.[4][2] The yoni is conceptualized as nature's gateway of all births, particularly in the esoteric Kaula and Tantra practices, as well as the Shaktism and Shaivism traditions of Hinduism.[6]","image":"Shiva_Lingam_with_Gauripatta_at_Mahasthangarh_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"Yoni"}
