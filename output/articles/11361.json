{"title":"Courtship","summary":"Courtship is the period of development towards a sexual relationship wherein a couple get to know each other and decide whether there will be an engagement, followed by a marriage. A courtship may be an informal and private matter between two people or may be a public affair, or a formal arrangement with family approval. Traditionally, in the case of a formal engagement, it is the role of a male to actively \"court\" or \"woo\" a female, thus encouraging her to understand him and her receptiveness to a marriage proposal.","image":"Together.png.webp","url":"Courtship"}
