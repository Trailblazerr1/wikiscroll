{"title":"Be Here Now (album)","summary":"Be Here Now is the third studio album by English rock band Oasis, released on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. The album was recorded at multiple recording studios in London, including Abbey Road Studios, as well as Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey. Although most tracks retain the anthemic quality of previous releases, the songs on Be Here Now are longer and contain many guitar overdubs. Noel Gallagher said this was done to make the album sound as \"colossal\" as possible. The album cover features a shot of the band members at Stocks House in Hertfordshire.","image":"BeHereNowcover.jpg.webp"}
