{"title":"Phytoestrogen","summary":"A phytoestrogen is a  plant-derived xenoestrogen (see estrogen) not generated within the endocrine system, but consumed by eating phytoestrogenic plants. Also called a \"dietary estrogen\", it is a diverse group of naturally occurring  nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of its structural similarity with estradiol (17-Î²-estradiol), have the ability to cause estrogenic and/or antiestrogenic effects.[1] Phytoestrogens are not essential nutrients because their absence from the diet does not cause a disease, nor are they known to participate in any normal biological function.[1]","image":"Phytoestrogens2.png.webp"}
