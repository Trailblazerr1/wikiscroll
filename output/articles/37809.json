{"title":"Rhinorrhea","summary":"Rhinorrhea or rhinorrhoea is the free discharge of a thin nasal mucus fluid.[1] The condition, commonly known as a runny nose, occurs relatively frequently. Rhinorrhea is a common symptom of allergies (hay fever) or certain viral infections, such as the common cold. It can be a side effect of crying, exposure to cold temperatures, cocaine abuse,[2] or withdrawal, such as from opioids like methadone.[3] Treatment for rhinorrhea is not usually necessary, but there are a number of medical treatments and preventive techniques available.","image":"Illu_nose_nasal_cavities.jpg.webp","url":"Rhinorrhea"}
