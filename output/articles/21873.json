{"title":"Indigenous peoples in Brazil","summary":"Indigenous peoples in Brazil (Portuguese: povos indígenas no Brasil) or Indigenous Brazilians (Portuguese: indígenas brasileiros) once comprised an estimated 2000 tribes and nations inhabiting what is now the country of Brazil, before European contact around 1500. Christopher Columbus thought he had reached the East Indies, but Portuguese Vasco da Gama had already reached India via the Indian Ocean route, when Brazil was colonized by Portugal. Nevertheless, the word índios (\"Indians\") was by then established to designate the people of the New World and continues to be used in the Portuguese language to designate these people, while a person from India is called indiano in order to distinguish the two.","image":"Menina_da_etnia_Terena.jpg.webp"}
