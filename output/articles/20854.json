{"title":"Hounds of Love","summary":"Hounds of Love is the fifth studio album by British singer-songwriter and musician Kate Bush, released by EMI Records on 16 September 1985. It was a commercial success and marked a return to the public eye for Bush after the relatively poor sales of her previous album, 1982's The Dreaming. The album's lead single, \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\", became one of Bush's biggest hits. The album's first side produced three further successful singles, \"Cloudbusting\", \"Hounds of Love\", and \"The Big Sky\". The second side, subtitled The Ninth Wave, forms a conceptual suite about a woman drifting alone in the sea at night.","image":"Katebushhoundsoflove.png.webp"}
