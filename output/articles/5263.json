{"title":"Babirusa","summary":"The babirusas, also called deer-pigs (Indonesian: babi rusa[1]) are a genus, Babyrousa, in the swine family found in the Indonesian islands of Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru.[2] All members of this genus were considered part of a single species until 2002, the babirusa, B. babyrussa, but following that, was split into several species. This scientific name is restricted to the Buru babirusa from Buru and Sula, whereas the best-known species, the north Sulawesi babirusa, is named B. celebensis.[3] The remarkable \"prehistoric\" appearance of these mammals is largely due to the prominent upwards incurving canine tusks of the males, which actually pierce the flesh in the snout.[4]","image":"Hirscheber1a.jpg.webp"}
