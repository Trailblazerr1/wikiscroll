{"title":"Destroyer","summary":"In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort\nlarger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against  powerful short range attackers. They were originally developed in 1885 by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy[1][2] as a defense against torpedo boats, and by the time of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these \"torpedo boat destroyers\" (TBDs) were \"large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats designed to destroy other torpedo boats\".[3] Although the term \"destroyer\" had been used interchangeably with \"TBD\" and \"torpedo boat destroyer\" by navies since 1892, the term \"torpedo boat destroyer\" had been generally shortened to simply \"destroyer\" by nearly all navies by the First World War.[4]","image":"USS_Winston_S._Churchill.jpg.webp"}
