{"title":"New Zealand dollar","summary":"The New Zealand dollar (sign: $; code: NZD, also abbreviated NZ$) (Māori: tāra o Aotearoa) is the official currency and legal tender of New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross Dependency, Tokelau, and a British territory, the Pitcairn Islands.[1] Within New Zealand, it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ($), with \"NZ$\" sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. In the context of currency trading, it is rarely informally called the \"Kiwi\" or \"Kiwi dollar\",[2] since New Zealand is commonly associated with the kiwi and the one-dollar coin depicts the indigenous bird on its reverse.","image":"NZ_one_dollar_reverse.jpg.webp","url":"New_Zealand_dollar"}
