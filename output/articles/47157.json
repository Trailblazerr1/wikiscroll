{"title":"Variety (botany)","summary":"In botanical nomenclature, variety (abbreviated var.; in Latin: varietas) is a taxonomic rank below that of species and subspecies, but above that of  form.[1] As such, it gets a three-part infraspecific name. It is sometimes recommended that the subspecies rank should be used to recognize geographic distinctiveness, whereas the variety rank is appropriate if the taxon is seen throughout the geographic range of the species.[2]","image":"Biological_classification_L_Pengo_vflip.svg.png.webp","url":"Variety_(botany)"}
