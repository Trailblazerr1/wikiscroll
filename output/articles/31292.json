{"title":"Nasir al-Din al-Tusi","summary":"Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Tūsī (Persian: محمد ابن محمد ابن حسن طوسی‎ 18 February 1201 – 26 June 1274), better known as Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (Persian: نصیر الدین طوسی‎; or simply Tusi /ˈtuːsi/[4] in the West), was a Persian polymath, architect, philosopher, physician, scientist, and theologian.[5] Nasir al-Din al-Tusi was a well published author, writing on subjects of math, engineering, prose, and mysticism. Additionally, al-Tusi made several scientific advancements. In astronomy, al-Tusi created very accurate tables of planetary motion, an updated planetary model, and critiques of Ptolemaic astronomy. He also made strides in logic, mathematics but especially trigonometry, biology, and chemistry. Nasir al-Din al-Tusi left behind a great legacy as well. Some consider Tusi one of the greatest scientists of medieval Islam,[6] since he is often considered the creator of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right.[7][8][9]\nThe  Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) considered Tusi to be the greatest of the later Persian scholars.[10] There is also reason to believe that he may have influenced Copernican heliocentrism.[11][12][13][14][15][16]","image":"Nasir_al-Din_Tusi.jpg.webp"}
