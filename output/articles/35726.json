{"title":"Pound sign","summary":"The pound sign £ is the symbol for the pound sterling – the currency of the United Kingdom and previously of Great Britain and of the Kingdom of England. The same symbol is used for other currencies called pound, such as the Gibraltar, Egyptian, Manx and Syrian pounds. The sign may be drawn with one or two bars (this is a font design choice) but the Bank of England has used the one-bar style exclusively since 1975.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
