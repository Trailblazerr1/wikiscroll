{"title":"Cumbric","summary":"Cumbric was a variety of the Common Brittonic language spoken during the Early Middle Ages in the Hen Ogledd or \"Old North\" in what is now Northern England and southern Lowland Scotland.[2] It was closely related to Old Welsh and the other Brittonic languages. Place name evidence suggests Cumbric may also have been spoken as far south as Pendle and the Yorkshire Dales. The prevailing view is that it became extinct in the 12th century, after the incorporation of the semi-independent Kingdom of Strathclyde into the Kingdom of Scotland.","image":"Cumbric_region.png.webp","url":"Cumbric"}
