{"title":"Parliament of the United Kingdom","summary":"The Parliament of the United Kingdom[note 1] is the supreme legislative body of the United Kingdom, the Crown dependencies and the British overseas territories.[5][6] It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and the overseas territories. Parliament is bicameral but has three parts, consisting of the sovereign (Crown-in-Parliament), the House of Lords, and the House of Commons (the primary chamber).[7][8] Both houses of Parliament meet in separate chambers at the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, one of the inner boroughs of the capital city, London.","image":"Crowned_Portcullis.svg.png.webp"}
