{"title":"Field-programmable gate array","summary":"A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing – hence the term field-programmable. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Circuit diagrams were previously used to specify the configuration, but this is increasingly rare due to the advent of electronic design automation tools.","image":"Altera_StratixIVGX_FPGA.jpg.webp","url":"Field-programmable_gate_array"}
