{"title":"Fentanyl","summary":"Fentanyl, also spelled fentanil, is a powerful opioid used as a pain medication and, together with other medications, for anesthesia.[3] It is also used as a recreational drug, sometimes mixed with heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine, and its potentially deadly overdose effects can be neutralized by naloxone.[5] Fentanyl is commonly used to create counterfeit drugs marketed as OxyContin, Xanax, Adderall, and other pills. It has a rapid onset and its effects generally last under two hours.[3] Medically, it is used by injection, nasal spray, or skin patch, or absorbed through the cheek as a lozenge or tablet.[3][6]","image":"Fentanyl2DCSD.svg.png.webp"}
