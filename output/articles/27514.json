{"title":"Low-pressure area","summary":"In meteorology, a low-pressure area, low area or low is a region where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that of surrounding locations.  Low-pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the atmosphere. The formation process of a low-pressure area is known as cyclogenesis. In meteorology, atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two kinds of places:","image":"Southern_hemisphere_extratropical_cyclone.jpg.webp","url":"Low-pressure_area"}
