{"title":"Labia","summary":"The labia are part of the female genitalia; they are the major externally visible portions of the vulva. In humans, there are two pairs of labia: the labia majora (or the outer labia) are larger and thicker, while the labia minora are folds of skin between the outer labia.  The labia surround and protect the clitoris and the openings of the vagina and the urethra.","image":"Grosse_und_kleine_Schamlippen.jpg.webp"}
