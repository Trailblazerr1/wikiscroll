{"title":"Electromagnetic coil","summary":"An electromagnetic coil is an electrical conductor such as a wire in the shape of a coil, spiral or helix.[1][2]  Electromagnetic coils are used in electrical engineering, in applications where electric currents interact with magnetic fields, in devices such as electric motors, generators, inductors, electromagnets, transformers, and sensor coils.  Either an electric current is passed through the wire of the coil to generate a magnetic field, or conversely, an external time-varying magnetic field through the interior of the coil generates an EMF (voltage) in the conductor.","image":"Magnetic_field_of_loop_3.svg.png.webp","url":"Electromagnetic_coil"}
