{"title":"Subprime mortgage crisis","summary":"The United States subprime mortgage crisis was a multinational financial crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010 that contributed to the 2007â€“2008 global financial crisis.[1][2] It was triggered by a large decline in US home prices after the collapse of a housing bubble, leading to mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures, and the devaluation of housing-related securities. Declines in residential investment preceded the Great Recession and were followed by reductions in household spending and then business investment. Spending reductions were more significant in areas with a combination of high household debt and larger housing price declines.[3]","image":"President_Discusses_Education%2C_Entrepreneurship_%26_Home_Ownership_at_Indiana_Black_Expo.jpg.webp","url":"Subprime_mortgage_crisis"}
