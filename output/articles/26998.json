{"title":"List of songs recorded by Coldplay","summary":"British rock band Coldplay have recorded over 175 songs during their career. Since their formation in 1996, Coldplay have credited all of their songs to all four members of the group. At the beginning of their career, Coldplay's music was described as post-Britpop,[1] with the band Travis being one of their primary influences.[2] The group also has an alternative rock style,[3] said to be reminiscent of Oasis and Radiohead.[4] After releasing two EPs, Safety (1998) and The Blue Room (1999),[5] the group released their debut album Parachutes in 2000. It showcased the group's alternative rock, post-Britpop and indie rock side (\"Shiver\", \"Don't Panic\", \"Yellow\"), with moody, atmospheric songs characterised as dream pop.[4][6] Compared to its predecessor, A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) contains more piano-driven (\"Clocks\", \"The Scientist\") and guitar-driven songs (\"God Put a Smile upon Your Face\", \"A Whisper\"),[7] as well as ballads (\"In My Place\") and lyrical themes that reflect love and relationships.[8][9]","image":"ColdplayParis160717-7_(35938478112).jpg.webp","url":"List_of_songs_recorded_by_Coldplay"}
