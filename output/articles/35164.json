{"title":"Planets in astrology","summary":"Planets in astrology have a meaning different from the astronomical understanding of what a planet is. Before the age of telescopes, the night sky was thought to consist of two very similar components: fixed stars, which remained motionless in relation to each other, and \"wandering stars\" (Ancient Greek: ἀστέρες πλανῆται asteres planetai), which moved relative to the fixed stars over the course of the year.","image":"Astrological_Chart_-_New_Millennium.JPG.webp","url":"Planets_in_astrology"}
