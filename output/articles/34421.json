{"title":"Peppered moth evolution","summary":"The evolution of the peppered moth is an evolutionary instance of directional colour change in the moth population as a consequence of air pollution during the Industrial Revolution. The frequency of dark-coloured moths increased at that time, an example of industrial melanism. Later, when pollution was reduced, the light-coloured form again predominated. Industrial melanism in the peppered moth was an early test of Charles Darwin's natural selection in action, and remains as a classic example in the teaching of evolution.[1][2] In 1978 Sewall Wright described it as \"the clearest case in which a conspicuous evolutionary process has actually been observed.\"[3][4]","image":"Biston.betularia.7200.jpg.webp","url":"Peppered_moth_evolution"}
