{"title":"Projections of population growth","summary":"Population projections are attempts to show how the human population living today will change in the future.[1] These projections are an important input to forecasts of the population's impact on this planet and humanity's future well-being.[2] Models of population growth take trends in human development, and apply projections into the future.[3] These models use trend-based-assumptions about how populations will respond to economic, social and technological forces to understand how they will affect fertility and mortality, and thus population growth.[3]","image":"World_population_growth%2C_1700-2100%2C_2019_revision.png.webp","url":"Projections_of_population_growth"}
