{"title":"Price elasticity of demand","summary":"A good's 'price elasticity of demand' ( E d {\\displaystyle E_{d}} , PED) is a measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to its price. When the price rises, quantity demanded falls for almost any good, but it falls more for some than for others. The price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant. If the elasticity is -2, that means a one percent price rise leads to a two percent decline in quantity demanded. Other elasticities measure how the quantity demanded changes with other variables (e.g. the income elasticity of demand for consumer income changes).[1]","image":"a5309595859d5c22cc6542e45ce7e5b0dc9db73d.svg","url":"Price_elasticity_of_demand"}
