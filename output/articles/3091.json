{"title":"Alteplase","summary":"Alteplase (t-PA) is a thrombolytic medication, used to treat acute ischemic stroke, acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (a type of heart attack), pulmonary embolism associated with low blood pressure, and blocked central venous catheter.[4] It is given by injection into a vein or artery.[4] Alteplase is the same as the normal human plasminogen activator produced in vascular endothelial cells[5] and is synthesized via recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). Alteplase causes the breakdown of a clot by inducing fibrinolysis.[6]","image":"\"Localisation_du_thrombus_et_cons√©quences_2\"_by_Servier_Medical_Art_is_licensed_under_CC_BY_2.0.jpg.webp","url":"Alteplase"}
