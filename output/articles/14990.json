{"title":"Epithelial sodium channel","summary":"The epithelial sodium channel (short: ENaC, also: amiloride-sensitive sodium channel) is a membrane-bound ion channel that is selectively permeable to the ions of sodium (Na+) and that is assembled as a heterotrimer composed of three homologous subunits α or δ, β, and γ,[2] These subunits are encoded by four genes: SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D. It is involved primarily in the reabsorption of sodium ions at the collecting ducts of the kidney's nephrons. In addition to being implicated in diseases where fluid balance across epithelial membranes is perturbed, including pulmonary edema, cystic fibrosis, COPD and COVID-19, proteolyzed forms of ENaC function as the human salt taste receptor.[3]","image":"ENaC_6BQN_subunit-colored.png.webp"}
