{"title":"Ganges","summary":"The Ganges (/ˈɡændʒiːz/ GAN-jeez) (in India: Ganga (/ˈɡʌŋɡə/ GUNG-gə); in Bangladesh: Padma (/ˈpʌdmə/ PUD-mə))[5][6][7][8] is a trans-boundary river of Asia which flows through India and Bangladesh. The 2,525 km (1,569 mi) river rises in the western Himalayas in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It flows south and east through the Gangetic plain of North India, where it receives the right-bank tributary, the Yamuna and left-bank tributaries from Nepal that account for the bulk of its flow.[9][10] It then enters Bangladesh, its name changing to Padma, is joined by the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra, and eventually breaks up, forming the major portion of the Ganges Delta, and emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Ganges is the third largest river on earth by discharge.[11]","image":"Varanasiganga.jpg.webp","url":"Ganges"}
