{"title":"Sampling (signal processing)","summary":"In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal).","image":"Signal_Sampling.svg.png.webp","url":"Sampling_(signal_processing)"}
