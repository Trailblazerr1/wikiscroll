{"title":"Corundum","summary":"Corundum is a crystalline form of aluminium oxide (Al2O3) typically containing traces of iron, titanium, vanadium and chromium.[2][3] It is a rock-forming mineral. It is a naturally transparent material, but can have different colors depending on the presence of transition metal impurities in its crystalline structure.[6] Corundum has two primary gem varieties: ruby and sapphire. Rubies are red due to the presence of chromium, and sapphires exhibit a range of colors depending on what transition metal is present.[6] A rare type of sapphire, padparadscha sapphire, is pink-orange.","image":"Several_corundum_crystals.jpg.webp"}
