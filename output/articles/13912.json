{"title":"EPR paradox","summary":"The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox (EPR paradox) is a thought experiment proposed by physicists Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR), with which they argued that the description of physical reality provided by quantum mechanics was incomplete.[1] In a 1935 paper titled \"Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?\", they argued for the existence of \"elements of reality\" that were not part of quantum theory, and speculated that it should be possible to construct a theory containing them. Resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"EPR_paradox"}
