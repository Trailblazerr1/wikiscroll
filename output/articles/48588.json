{"title":"William M. Jennings Trophy","summary":"The William M. Jennings Trophy is an annual National Hockey League (NHL) award given to \"the goaltender(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it ... based on regular-season play.\"[1] From 1946 until 1981, the Vezina Trophy had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. It is named in honor of William M. Jennings, the longtime governor and president of the New York Rangers. Since its beginnings in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 32 seasons to 53 different players; mostly in tandems of two goaltenders.","image":"William_M._Jennings_Trophy_(Hockey_Hall_of_Fame%2C_Toronto).jpg.webp"}
