{"title":"Nevada Test Site","summary":"The Nevada National Security Site (N2S2[1] or NNSS), known as the Nevada Test Site (NTS) until August 23, 2010,[2] is a United States Department of Energy (DoE) reservation located in southeastern Nye County, Nevada, about 65 miles (105 km) northwest of the city of Las Vegas. Formerly known as the Nevada Proving Grounds, the site was established on January 11, 1951 for the testing of nuclear devices, covering approximately 1,360 square miles (3,500 km2) of desert and mountainous terrain. Nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site began with a 1-kiloton-of-TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951. Over the subsequent four decades, over one thousand nuclear explosions were detonated at the NTS.[3] Many of the iconic images of the nuclear era come from the NTS. NNSS is operated by Mission Support and Test Services, LLC.","image":"Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_(Buster-Jangle_Dog)_002.jpg.webp","url":"Nevada_Test_Site"}
