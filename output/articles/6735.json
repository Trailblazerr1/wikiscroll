{"title":"Bishops in the Catholic Church","summary":"In the Catholic Church, a bishop is an ordained minister who holds the fullness of the sacrament of holy orders and is responsible for teaching doctrine,[1] governing Catholics in his jurisdiction,[2] sanctifying the world[3] and representing the Church.[4][5] Catholics trace the origins of the office of bishop to the apostles, who it is believed were endowed with a special charism by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.[6] Catholics believe this special charism has been transmitted through an unbroken succession of bishops by the laying on of hands in the sacrament of holy orders.[7]","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp","url":"Bishops_in_the_Catholic_Church"}
