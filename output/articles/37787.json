{"title":"Rhamphorhynchus","summary":"Rhamphorhynchus (/ˌræmfəˈrɪŋkəs/,[1] \"beak snout\") is a genus of long-tailed pterosaurs in the Jurassic period. Less specialized than contemporary, short-tailed pterodactyloid pterosaurs such as Pterodactylus, it had a long tail, stiffened with ligaments, which ended in a characteristic soft-tissue tail vane. The mouth of Rhamphorhynchus housed needle-like teeth, which were angled forward, with a curved, sharp, beak-like tip lacking teeth, indicating a diet mainly of fish; indeed, fish and cephalopod remains are frequently found in Rhamphorhynchus abdominal contents, as well as in their coprolites.[2]","image":"Rhamphorhynchus_munsteri.jpg.webp","url":"Rhamphorhynchus"}
