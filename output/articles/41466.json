{"title":"South Downs","summary":"The South Downs are a range of chalk hills that extends for about 260 square miles (670Â km2)[1] across the south-eastern coastal counties of England from the Itchen valley of Hampshire in the west to Beachy Head, in the Eastbourne Downland Estate, East Sussex, in the east. The Downs are bounded on the northern side by a steep escarpment, from whose crest there are extensive views northwards across the Weald. The South Downs National Park forms a much larger area than the chalk range of the South Downs and includes large parts of the Weald.","image":"Seven_Sisters_cliffs_and_the_coastguard_cottages%2C_from_Seaford_Head_showing_Cuckmere_Haven_(looking_east_-_2003-05-26).jpg.webp","url":"South_Downs"}
