{"title":"Sepsis","summary":"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.[4] This initial stage is followed by suppression of the immune system.[8] Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion.[1] There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection.[2] The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may have no symptoms of a specific infection, and the body temperature may be low or normal instead of having a fever.[2] Severe sepsis causes poor organ function or blood flow.[9] The presence of low blood pressure, high blood lactate, or low urine output may suggest poor blood flow.[9] Septic shock is low blood pressure due to sepsis that does not improve after fluid replacement.[9]","image":"Sepsis-Mikrothomben1.JPG.webp","url":"Sepsis"}
