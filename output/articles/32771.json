{"title":"Ogham","summary":"Ogham (/ˈɒɡəm/ OG-əm,[4] Modern Irish: [ˈoː(ə)mˠ]; Middle Irish: ogum, ogom, later ogam [ˈɔɣəmˠ][5][6]) is an Early Medieval alphabet used primarily to write the early Irish language (in the \"orthodox\" inscriptions, 4th to 6th centuries CE), and later the Old Irish language (scholastic ogham, 6th to 9th centuries). There are roughly 400 surviving orthodox inscriptions on stone monuments throughout Ireland and western Britain, the bulk of which are in southern Munster.[7] The largest number outside Ireland are in Pembrokeshire, Wales.[8]","image":"Ogham_Stone_Rathass_Church_Tralee_Kerry.jpg.webp","url":"Ogham"}
