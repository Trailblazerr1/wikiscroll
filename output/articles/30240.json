{"title":"Module (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a module is one of the fundamental algebraic structures used in abstract algebra. A module over a ring is a generalization of the notion of vector space over a field, wherein scalars are elements of a given ring, and an operation called scalar multiplication is defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module. A module taking its scalars from a ring R is called an R-module.","image":"Latex_integers.svg.png.webp"}
