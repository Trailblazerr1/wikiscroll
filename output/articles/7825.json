{"title":"Buenos Aires","summary":"Buenos Aires (/ˌbweɪnəs ˈɛəriːz/ or /-ˈaɪrɪs/;[6] Spanish pronunciation: [ˈbwenos ˈajɾes] (listen)),[7] officially the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (Spanish: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires), is the capital and largest city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the Río de la Plata, on South America's southeastern coast. \"Buenos Aires\" can be translated as \"fair winds\" or \"good airs\", but the former was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\", named after the Madonna of Bonaria in Sardinia, Italy.","image":"Montaje_de_la_Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires.png.webp","url":"Buenos_Aires"}
