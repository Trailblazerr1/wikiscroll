{"title":"Durrell's vontsira","summary":"Durrell's vontsira (Salanoia durrelli)[3] is a mammal in the family Eupleridae of the order Carnivora, native to Madagascar. It is most closely related to the brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor), with which it forms the genus Salanoia. The two are genetically similar, but morphologically distinct, leading scientists to recognize them as separate species. After an individual was observed in 2004, the animal became known to science and S.Â durrelli was described as a new species in 2010. It is found only in the Lac Alaotra area.","image":"Alaotra_carnivore_credit_Fidimalala_Bruno_Ralainasolo.jpg.webp","url":"Durrell's_vontsira"}
