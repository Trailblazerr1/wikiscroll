{"title":"Life peer","summary":"In the United Kingdom, life peers are appointed members of the peerage whose titles cannot be inherited, in contrast to hereditary peers. In modern times, life peerages, always created at the rank of baron, are created under the Life Peerages Act 1958 and entitle the holders to seats in the House of Lords, presuming they meet qualifications such as age and citizenship. The legitimate children of a life peer are entitled to style themselves with the prefix \"The Honourable\", although they cannot inherit the peerage itself.","image":"Coronet_of_a_British_Duke.svg.png.webp"}
