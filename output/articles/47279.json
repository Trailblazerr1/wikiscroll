{"title":"Vermiculite","summary":"Vermiculite is a hydrous phyllosilicate mineral which undergoes significant expansion when heated. Exfoliation occurs when the mineral is heated sufficiently, and commercial furnaces can routinely produce this effect. Vermiculite forms by the weathering or hydrothermal alteration of biotite or phlogopite.[2]\nLarge commercial vermiculite mines currently exist in the United States, Russia, South Africa, China, and Brazil.","image":"VermiculiteUSGOV.jpg.webp"}
