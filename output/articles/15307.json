{"title":"Eurasia","summary":"Eurasia (/jʊəˈreɪʒə/) is the largest continental area on Earth, comprising all of Europe and Asia.[3][4] Primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it spans from the British Isles and the Iberian Peninsula in the west to the Japanese archipelago in the east. The continental landmass is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean and Africa to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south.[5] The division between Europe and Asia as two continents is a historical social construct, as much of their borders is over land; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six, five, or four continents on Earth.[4] In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on paleomagnetic data.[6][7]","image":"Eurasia_(orthographic_projection).svg.png.webp","url":"Eurasia"}
