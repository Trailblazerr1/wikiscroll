{"title":"Cave of the Patriarchs","summary":"The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews as the Cave of Machpelah (Hebrew: מערת המכפלה‎, Me'arat HaMakhpela , lit. 'Cave of the Double Caves') and to Muslims as the Sanctuary of Abraham (Arabic: الحرم الإبراهيمي‎, al-Haram al-Ibrahimi ), is a series of caves situated 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological.[2][3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
