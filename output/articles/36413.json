{"title":"Psychiatric medication","summary":"A psychiatric or psychotropic medication is a psychoactive drug taken to exert an effect on the chemical makeup of the brain and nervous system. Thus, these medications are used to treat mental illnesses. These medications are typically made of synthetic chemical compounds and are usually prescribed in psychiatric settings, potentially involuntarily during commitment. Since the mid-20th century, such medications have been leading treatments for a broad range of mental disorders and have decreased the need for long-term hospitalization, therefore, lowering the cost of mental health care.[1][2][3][4] The recidivism or rehospitalization of the mentally ill is at a high rate in many countries and the reasons for the relapses are under research.[5][6][7][8]","image":"Ritalin-SR-20mg-full.jpg.webp"}
