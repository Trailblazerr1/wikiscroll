{"title":"Speaking in tongues","summary":"Speaking in tongues, also known as glossolalia, is a practice in which people utter words or speech-like sounds, often thought by believers to be languages unknown to the speaker. One definition used by linguists is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning, in some cases as part of religious practice in which some believe it to be a divine language unknown to the speaker.[2] Glossolalia is practiced in Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity,[3][4] as well as in other religions.[5][6]","image":"Pentecost_icon.jpg.webp"}
