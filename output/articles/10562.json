{"title":"Colorado Plateau","summary":"The Colorado Plateau, also known as the Colorado Plateau Province,[1] is a physiographic and desert region of the Intermontane Plateaus, roughly centered on the Four Corners region of the southwestern United States. This province covers an area of 336,700 km2 (130,000 mi2) within western Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, southern and eastern Utah, northern Arizona, and a tiny fraction in the extreme southeast of Nevada. About 90% of the area is drained by the Colorado River and its main tributaries: the Green, San Juan, and Little Colorado.  Most of the remainder of the plateau is drained by the Rio Grande and its tributaries.[2][3]: 395","image":"Colorado_Plateaus_map.png.webp","url":"Colorado_Plateau"}
