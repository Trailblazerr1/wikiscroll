Artisanal gelato in Italy generally contains 6-10% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert.[1][2] Gelato typically contains 70% less air and more flavoring than other kinds of frozen desserts, giving it a density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.[3][4]","image":"CafeMia.jpg.webp","url":"Gelato"}
