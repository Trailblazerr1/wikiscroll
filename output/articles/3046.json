{"title":"AlphaGo","summary":"AlphaGo is a computer program that plays the board game Go.[1] It was developed by DeepMind Technologies[2] a subsidiary of Google (now Alphabet Inc.). Subsequent versions of AlphaGo became increasingly powerful, including a version that competed under the name Master.[3] After retiring from competitive play, AlphaGo Master was succeeded by an even more powerful version known as AlphaGo Zero, which was completely self-taught without learning from human games. AlphaGo Zero was then generalized into a program known as AlphaZero, which played additional games, including chess and shogi.  AlphaZero has in turn been succeeded by a program known as MuZero which learns without being taught the rules.","image":"Alphago_logo_Reversed.svg.png.webp"}
