{"title":"Vasectomy","summary":"Vasectomy is a surgical procedure for male sterilization or permanent contraception. During the procedure, the male vasa deferentia are cut and tied or sealed so as to prevent sperm from entering into the urethra and thereby prevent fertilization of a female through sexual intercourse. Vasectomies are usually performed in a physician's office, medical clinic, or, when performed on an animal, in a veterinary clinicâ€”hospitalization is not normally required as the procedure is not complicated, the incisions are small, and the necessary equipment routine.","image":"Vasectomy_diagram-en.svg.png.webp"}
