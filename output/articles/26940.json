{"title":"List of national anthems","summary":"Most nation states have an anthem, defined as \"a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism\";[1] most anthems are either marches or hymns in style. A song or hymn can become a national anthem under the state's constitution, by a law enacted by its legislature, or simply by tradition.[2] A royal anthem is a patriotic song similar to a national anthem, but it specifically praises or prays for a monarch or royal dynasty. Such anthems are usually performed at public appearances by the monarch or during other events of royal importance.[3] Some states use their royal anthem as the national anthem, such as the state anthem of Jordan.","image":"Pils_rouget_lisle_chantant_marseillaise_mb_(Mus√©e).jpg.webp"}
