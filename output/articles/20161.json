{"title":"Here Come the Warm Jets","summary":"Here Come the Warm Jets is the debut solo album by British musician Brian Eno, released on Island Records in January 1974. It was recorded and produced by Eno following his departure from the band Roxy Music, and blends glam and pop stylings with avant-garde approaches. The album features numerous guests, including three of Eno's former Roxy bandmates (guitarist Phil Manzanera, saxophonist/keyboardist Andy Mackay and drummer Paul Thompson), drummer Simon King (of Hawkwind), bassist Bill MacCormick (of Matching Mole), guitarist/bassist Paul Rudolph (of Pink Fairies) and guitarist Robert Fripp and bassist John Wetton (both of King Crimson). Notable contributions were also made by some members of rock band Sharks, including guitarist Chris Spedding, bassist Busta Jones, keyboardist Nick Judd and drummer Marty Simon, and gospel vocal group Sweetfeed. In developing the material with the various musicians, Eno devised unusual methods and instructions to obtain unexpected results.[2]","image":"Warmjetsvinyl.jpg.webp","url":"Here_Come_the_Warm_Jets"}
