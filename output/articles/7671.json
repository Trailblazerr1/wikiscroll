{"title":"Broadwell (microarchitecture)","summary":"Broadwell is the fifth generation of the Intel Core Processor. It is Intel's codename for the 14 nanometer die shrink of its Haswell microarchitecture. It is a \"tick\" in Intel's tickâ€“tock principle as the next step in semiconductor fabrication.[2][3][4] Like some of the previous tick-tock iterations, Broadwell did not completely replace the full range of CPUs from the previous microarchitecture (Haswell), as there were no low-end desktop CPUs based on Broadwell.[5]","image":"Fully_Integrated_Voltage_Regulator.svg.png.webp"}
