{"title":"Cannon","summary":"A cannon is a large-caliber gun classified as a type of artillery, and usually launches a projectile using explosive chemical propellant. Gunpowder (\"black powder\") was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder during the late 19th century. Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield.","image":"Cannon%2C_Ch√¢teau_du_Haut-Koenigsbourg%2C_France.jpg.webp","url":"Cannon"}
