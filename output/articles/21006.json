{"title":"Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup","summary":"In human genetics, a human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup is a haplogroup defined by mutations in the non-recombining portions of DNA from the male-specific Y chromosome (called Y-DNA). Many people within a haplogroup share similar numbers of short tandem repeats (STRs) and types of mutations called single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).[2]","image":"Human_Y-DNA_phylogeny_and_haplogroup_distribution.png.webp"}
