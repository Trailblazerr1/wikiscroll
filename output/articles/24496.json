{"title":"Katyn massacre","summary":"The Katyn massacre[lower-alpha 1] was a series of mass executions of nearly 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia carried out by the Soviet Union, specifically the NKVD (\"People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs\", the Soviet secret police) in April and May 1940. Though the killings also occurred in the Kalinin and Kharkiv prisons and elsewhere, the massacre is named after the Katyn Forest, where some of the mass graves were first discovered.","image":"Trzy_krzyze.jpg.webp"}
