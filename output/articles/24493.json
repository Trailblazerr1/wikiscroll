{"title":"Katy Perry","summary":"Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry, is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. She sang in church during her childhood before pursuing a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and released her debut studio album, Katy Hudson, under her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. After Red Hill ceased operations, she moved to Los Angeles the following year to venture into secular music, adopting the stage name \"Katy Perry\" from her mother's maiden name. Perry subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard, Dr. Luke, and Max Martin on two albums that were later shelved, with much of the material being reworked onto One of the Boys.[1] Prior to signing a recording contract with Capitol Records in April 2007, she was also dropped by The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records.","image":"Katy_Perry_2019_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Katy_Perry"}
