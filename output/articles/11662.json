{"title":"Cultural assimilation of Native Americans","summary":"The cultural assimilation was a series of efforts by the United States to assimilate Native Americans into mainstream Europeanâ€“American culture between the years of 1790 and 1920.[1][2] George Washington and Henry Knox were first to propose, in an American context, the cultural assimilation of Native Americans.[3] They formulated a policy to encourage the so-called \"civilizing process\".[2] With increased waves of immigration from Europe, there was growing public support for education to encourage a standard set of cultural values and practices to be held in common by the majority of citizens. Education was viewed as the primary method in the acculturation process for minorities.","image":"Map_of_territorial_growth_1775.jpg.webp"}
