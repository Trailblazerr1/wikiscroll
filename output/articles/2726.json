{"title":"Aldfrith of Northumbria","summary":"Aldfrith (Early Modern Irish: Flann FÃ­na mac Ossu; Latin: Aldfrid, Aldfridus; died 14 December 704 or 705) was king of Northumbria from 685 until his death.  He is described by early writers such as Bede, Alcuin and Stephen of Ripon as a man of great learning.  Some of his works and some letters written to him survive. His reign was relatively peaceful, marred only by disputes with Bishop Wilfrid, a major figure in the early Northumbrian church.","image":"Aldfrith_sceat_beast_1.png.webp"}
