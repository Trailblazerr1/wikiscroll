{"title":"19 (Adele album)","summary":"19 is the debut studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele released on 28 January 2008, by XL Recordings. Following Adele's graduation from the BRIT School in April 2006, she began publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend, who posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to interest from the record label. This led to Adele signing a recording contract at age 17 with the label and providing vocals for Jack Peñate. During this session for Peñate's song she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album.","image":"Adele_-_19.png.webp","url":"19_(Adele_album)"}
