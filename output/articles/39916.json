{"title":"Sefer Yetzirah","summary":"Sefer Yetzirah (Hebrew: סֵפֶר יְצִירָה‎‎ Sēp̄er Yəṣīrā, Book of Formation, or Book of Creation) is the title of the earliest extant book on Jewish mysticism, although some early commentators treated it as a treatise on mathematical and linguistic theory as opposed to Kabbalah. Yetzirah is more literally translated as \"Formation\"; the word Briah is used for \"Creation\".[1] The book is traditionally ascribed to the patriarch Abraham, although others attribute its writing to Rabbi Akiva. Modern scholars have not reached consensus on the question of its origins. According to Rabbi Saadia Gaon, the objective of the book's author was to convey in writing how the things of our universe came into existence.[2] Conversely, Judah Halevi asserts that the main objective of the book, with its various examples, is to give to man the means by which he is able to understand the unity and omnipotence of God, which are multiform on one side and, yet, uniform on the other.[3]","image":"Yetzirah.png.webp","url":"Sefer_Yetzirah"}
