{"title":"Learning disability","summary":"Learning disability, learning disorder, or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors.  Given the \"difficulty learning in a typical manner\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \"learning difference\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \"learning disability\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \"learning difficulties\".[6]","image":"Take_a_picture_with_a_proud_dyslexic.jpg.webp"}
