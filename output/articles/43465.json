{"title":"Tautiška giesmė","summary":"\"Tautiška giesmė\" (pronounced [ˈtɐʊtʲɪʃkɐ ɡʲɪɛsʲˈmʲeː]; literally \"The National Hymn\") is the national anthem of Lithuania, also known by its opening words \"Lietuva, Tėvyne mūsų\" (official translation of the lyrics:[1] \"Lithuania, Our Homeland\", literally: \"Lithuania, Our Fatherland\") and as \"Lietuvos himnas\" (The National Anthem of Lithuania). The music and lyrics were written in 1898 by Vincas Kudirka, when Lithuania was still part of the Russian Empire. The fifty-word poem was a condensation of Kudirka's conceptions of the Lithuanian state, the Lithuanian people, and their past. Shortly before his death in 1899, the anthem was performed for Lithuanians living in Saint Petersburg, Russia.","image":"Lithuanian_national_anthem_sheet_music.jpg.webp"}
