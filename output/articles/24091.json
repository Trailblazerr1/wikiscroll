{"title":"Jugendstil","summary":"Jugendstil (\"Youth Style\") was an artistic movement, particularly in the decorative arts, that was influential primarily in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to a lesser extent from about 1895 until about 1910.[1]  It was the German counterpart of Art Nouveau. The members of the movement were reacting against the historicism and neo-classicism of the official art and architecture academies. It took its name from the art journal Jugend, founded by the German artist Georg Hirth. It was especially active in the graphic arts and interior decoration.","image":"Mathildenhoehe-ernst-ludwig-haus-076.jpg.webp"}
