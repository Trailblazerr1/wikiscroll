{"title":"Genital herpes","summary":"Genital herpes is an infection by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) of the genitals.[1] Most people either have no or mild symptoms and thus do not know they are infected.[1] When symptoms do occur, they typically include small blisters that break open to form painful ulcers.[1] Flu-like symptoms, such as fever, aching, or swollen lymph nodes, may also occur.[2] Onset is typically around 4 days after exposure with symptoms lasting up to 4 weeks.[1] Once infected further outbreaks may occur but are generally milder.[1]","image":"SOA-Herpes-genitalis-female.jpg.webp","url":"Genital_herpes"}
