{"title":"James Dunn (actor)","summary":"James Howard Dunn (November 2, 1901 – September 1, 1967), billed as Jimmy Dunn in his early career,[1] was an American stage, film, and television actor, and vaudeville performer. The son of a New York stockbroker, he initially worked in his father's firm but was more interested in theater. He landed jobs as an extra in short films produced by Paramount Pictures in its Long Island studio, and also performed with several stock theater companies, culminating with playing the male lead in the 1929 Broadway musical Sweet Adeline. This performance attracted the attention of film studio executives, and in 1931, Fox Film signed him to a Hollywood contract.","image":"James_Dunn.jpg.webp"}
