{"title":"Neman","summary":"The Nemunas, Nioman, Neman or Memel[nb 1] is a river in Europe that rises in central Belarus and flows through Lithuania then along the northern border of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia's western exclave which specifically then takes its southern mouth. It drains into its Curonian Lagoon, narrowly connected to the Baltic Sea. It flows about 937 km (582 mi), so it is considered a major Eastern European river. It flows generally west (to come at Grodno within 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of Poland), north, then westward.","image":"Neman_river.jpg.webp"}
