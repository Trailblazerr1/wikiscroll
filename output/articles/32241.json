{"title":"Node (networking)","summary":"In telecommunications networks, a node (Latin: nodus,  ‘knot’) is either  a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communication channel.[1] A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.","image":"Telecom-icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Node_(networking)"}
