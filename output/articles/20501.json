{"title":"History of anime","summary":"The history of anime can be traced back to the start of the 20th century, with the earliest verifiable films dating from 1907.[1] Before the advent of film, Japan already had a rich tradition of entertainment with colourful painted figures moving across the projection screen in utsushi-e (写し絵), a particular Japanese type of magic lantern show popular in the 19th century. Possibly inspired by European phantasmagoria shows, utsushi-e showmen used mechanical slides and developed lightweight wooden projectors (furo) that were handheld so that several performers could each control the motions of different projected figures.[2][3]","image":"Anime_eye.svg.png.webp"}
