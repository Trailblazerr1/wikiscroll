{"title":"Population of Canada","summary":"Canada ranks 37th by population, comprising about 0.5% of the world's total,[2] with over 38 million Canadians as of 2021.[3] Being, however, the fourth-largest country by land area (second-largest by total area), the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north and more than half of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec. Though Canada's population density is low, many regions in the south such as the Quebec Cityâ€“Windsor Corridor, have population densities higher than several European countries. Canada's largest population centres are Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa, with those six being the only ones with more than one million people.","image":"Canada_Population_density_map.jpg.webp"}
