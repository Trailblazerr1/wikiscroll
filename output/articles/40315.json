{"title":"Shasta Dam","summary":"Shasta Dam (called Kennett Dam[3] before its construction) is a concrete arch-gravity dam[4] across the Sacramento River in Northern California in the United States. At 602 feet (183 m) high, it is the eighth-tallest dam in the United States. Located at the north end of the Sacramento Valley, Shasta Dam creates Shasta Lake for long-term water storage, flood control, hydroelectricity and protection against the intrusion of saline water.[3] The largest reservoir in the state, Shasta Lake can hold about 4,500,000 acre-feet (5,600 GL).[5]","image":"Water_released_from_Shasta_Dam_(2017).jpg.webp"}
