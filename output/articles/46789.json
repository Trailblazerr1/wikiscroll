{"title":"United States v. Microsoft Corp.","summary":"United States v. Microsoft Corporation, 253 F.3d 34 (D.C. Cir. 2001)[1] is a noted American antitrust law case in which the U.S. government accused Microsoft of illegally maintaining its monopoly position in the personal computer (PC) market primarily through the legal and technical restrictions it put on the abilities of PC manufacturers (OEMs) and users to uninstall Internet Explorer and use other programs such as Netscape and Java. At trial, the district court ruled that Microsoft's actions constituted unlawful monopolization under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed most of the district court's judgments.","image":"Seal_of_the_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia.png.webp","url":"United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp."}
