{"title":"Zeolite","summary":"Zeolites are microporous, aluminosilicate minerals commonly used as commercial adsorbents and catalysts.[1] The term zeolite was originally coined in 1756 by Swedish mineralogist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who observed that rapidly heating a material, believed to have been stilbite, produced large amounts of steam from water that had been adsorbed by the material. Based on this, he called the material zeolite, from the Greek ζέω (zéō), meaning \"to boil\" and λίθος (líthos), meaning \"stone\".[2] The classic reference for the field has been Breck's book Zeolite Molecular Sieves: Structure, Chemistry, And Use.[3]","image":"Thomsonite-61017.jpg.webp","url":"Zeolite"}
