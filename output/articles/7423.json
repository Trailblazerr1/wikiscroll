{"title":"Brain death","summary":"Brain death is the complete loss of brain function, including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life.[1][2][3][4] It differs from persistent vegetative state, in which the person is alive and some autonomic functions remain.[5] It is also distinct from comas as long as some brain and bodily activity and function remain, and it is also not the same as the condition locked-in syndrome. A differential diagnosis can medically distinguish these differing conditions.","image":"Radionuclide_Cerebral_Blood_Flow_Scan.png.webp","url":"Brain_death"}
