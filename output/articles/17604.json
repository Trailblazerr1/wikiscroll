{"title":"Gene delivery","summary":"Gene delivery is the process of introducing foreign genetic material, such as DNA or RNA, into host cells.[1] Gene delivery must reach the genome of the host cell to induce gene expression.[2] Successful gene delivery requires the foreign gene delivery to remain stable within the host cell and can either integrate into the genome or replicate independently of it.[3] This requires foreign DNA to be synthesized as part of a vector, which is designed to enter the desired host cell and deliver the transgene to that cell's genome.[4] Vectors utilized as the method for gene delivery can be divided into two categories, recombinant viruses and synthetic vectors (viral and non-viral).[2][5]","image":"Genetic_engineering_logo.png.webp"}
