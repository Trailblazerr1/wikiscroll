{"title":"Helsinki Accords","summary":"The Helsinki Final Act, also known as Helsinki Accords or Helsinki Declaration was the document signed at the closing meeting of the third phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held in Helsinki, Finland, during 30 July – 1 August 1975, following two years of negotiations known as the Helsinki Process.[1] All then-existing European countries (except pro-Chinese Albania and semi-sovereign Andorra) as well as United States and Canada, altogether 35 participating states, signed the Final Act in an attempt to improve the détente between the East and the West. The Helsinki Accords, however, were not binding as they did not have treaty status that would have to be ratified by parliaments.[2] Sometimes the term \"Helsinki pact(s)\" was also used unofficially.[3]","image":"Schlussakte_Helsinki_1975_(KSZE).jpg.webp"}
