{"title":"Meta-analysis","summary":"A meta-analysis is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple scientific studies. Meta-analyses can be performed when there are multiple scientific studies addressing the same question, with each individual study reporting measurements that are expected to have some degree of error. The aim then is to use approaches from statistics to derive a pooled estimate closest to the unknown common truth based on how this error is perceived.","image":"Integrated_Molecular_Meta-Analysis_of_1%2C000_Pediatric_High-Grade_and_Diffuse_Intrinsic_Pontine_Glioma_-_graphical_abstract.jpg.webp"}
