Its aim is to create a comprehensive free content catalogue of all species; the project is directed at scientists, rather than at the general public. Jimmy Wales stated that editors are not required to fax in their degrees, but that submissions will have to pass muster with a technical audience.[1][2] Wikispecies is available under the GNU Free Documentation License and CC BY-SA 3.0.","image":"WikiSpecies.svg.png.webp"}
