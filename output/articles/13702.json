{"title":"Dual-clutch transmission","summary":"A dual-clutch transmission (DCT) (sometimes referred to as a twin-clutch transmission) is a type of multi-speed vehicle transmission system, that uses two separate clutches for odd and even gear sets.[1] The design is often similar to two separate manual transmissions with their respective clutches contained within one housing, and working as one unit.[2][3] In car and truck applications, the DCT functions as an automatic transmission, requiring no driver input to change gears.","image":"Dual-clutch_transmission.svg.png.webp"}
