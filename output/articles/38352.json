Before the displacement crisis in 2017, when over 740,000 fled to Bangladesh, an estimated 1.4 million Rohingya lived in Myanmar.[26][1][27][28] Described by journalists and news outlets as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world,[29][30][31] the Rohingya are denied citizenship under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law.[32][33][34] There are also restrictions on their freedom of movement, access to state education and civil service jobs.[34][35] The legal conditions faced by the Rohingya in Myanmar have been compared to apartheid[36][37][38][39] by some academics, analysts and political figures, including Nobel laureate Bishop Desmond Tutu, a South African anti-apartheid activist.[40] The most recent mass displacement of Rohingya in 2017 led the International Criminal Court investigating crimes against humanity, and led to the International Court of Justice investigating genocide.[41]","image":"Displaced_Rohingya_people_in_Rakhine_State_(8280610831)_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Rohingya_people"}
