{"title":"Tzedakah","summary":"Tzedakah or Ṣedaqah (Hebrew: צדקה‎ [ts(e)daˈka]) is a Hebrew word meaning \"righteousness\", but commonly used to signify charity.[1] This concept of \"charity\" differs from the modern Western understanding of \"charity.\" The latter is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity; tzedakah is an ethical obligation.","image":"Tzedakah_(charity)_box%2C_Charleston%2C_1820%2C_silver%2C_National_Museum_of_American_Jewish_History.JPG.webp"}
