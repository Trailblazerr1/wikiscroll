{"title":"Ulster loyalism","summary":"Ulster loyalism is a strand of Ulster unionism associated with working class Ulster Protestants in Northern Ireland. Like unionists, loyalists support the continued existence of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom, and oppose a united Ireland. Unlike other strands of unionism, loyalism has been described as an ethnic nationalism of Ulster Protestants and \"a variation of British nationalism\".[1][2] Loyalists are often said to have a conditional loyalty to the British state so long as it defends their interests.[3][4][5] They see themselves as loyal primarily to the Protestant British monarchy rather than to British governments and institutions,[6] while Garret FitzGerald argued they are loyal to 'Ulster' over 'the Union'.[7] A small minority of loyalists have called for an independent Ulster Protestant state, believing they cannot rely on British governments to support them (see Ulster nationalism). The term 'loyalism' is usually associated with paramilitarism.[3][8][9]","image":"Newbuildings_flags.jpg.webp"}
