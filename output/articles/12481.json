{"title":"Dehydroepiandrosterone","summary":"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), also known as androstenolone, is an endogenous steroid hormone precursor.[4] It is one of the most abundant circulating steroids in humans.[5] DHEA is produced in the adrenal glands,[6] the gonads, and the brain.[7] It functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids both in the gonads and in various other tissues.[4][8][9] However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors,[10] and acting as a neurosteroid and modulator of neurotrophic factor receptors.[11]","image":"Dehydroepiandrosteron.svg.png.webp","url":"Dehydroepiandrosterone"}
