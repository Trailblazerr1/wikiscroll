{"title":"Ganges Delta","summary":"The Ganges Delta (also known as the Sundarbans Delta or the Bengal Delta[1]) is a river delta in the Bengal region of South Asia, consisting of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. It is the world's largest river delta[2][3] and it empties into the Bay of Bengal with the combined waters of several river systems, mainly those of the Brahmaputra river and the Ganges river. It is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname the Green Delta. The delta stretches from the Hooghly River east as far as the Meghna River.","image":"Ganges_Delta_ESA22274217.jpeg.webp","url":"Ganges_Delta"}
