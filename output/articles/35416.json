{"title":"Polo Grounds","summary":"The Polo Grounds was the name of three stadiums in Upper Manhattan, New York City, used mainly for professional baseball and American football from 1880 through 1963. The original Polo Grounds, opened in 1876 and demolished in 1889, was built for the sport of polo. Bound on the south and north by 110th and 112th Streets and on the east and west by Fifth and Sixth (Lenox) Avenues, just north of Central Park, it was converted to a baseball stadium when leased by the New York Metropolitans in 1880. The third Polo Grounds, built in 1890, was renovated after a fire in 1911 and became Polo Grounds IV.  The fourth Polo Grounds is the one generally indicated when the Polo Grounds is referenced.   It was located in Coogan's Hollow and was noted for its distinctive bathtub shape, very short distances to the left and right field walls, and an unusually deep center field.","image":"No_Known_Restrictions_Polo_Grounds_during_World_Series_Game%2C_1913_from_the_Bain_Collection_(LOC)_(434431507).jpg.webp","url":"Polo_Grounds"}
