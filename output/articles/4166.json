The fiscal year is the accounting period of the federal government, which runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year.[3] Appropriations bills are under the jurisdiction of the United States House Committee on Appropriations and the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations.[2] Both Committees have twelve matching subcommittees, each tasked with working on one of the twelve annual regular appropriations bills.","image":"CapitalBuilding_Moon_ReflectingPool_12x18Print.jpg.webp","url":"Appropriations_bill_(United_States)"}
