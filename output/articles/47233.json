{"title":"Venetian glass","summary":"Venetian glass (Italian: vetro veneziano) is glassware made in Venice, typically on the island of Murano near the city.  Traditionally it is made with a soda-lime \"metal\" and is typically elaborately decorated, with various \"hot\" glass-forming techniques, as well as gilding, enamel, or engraving. Production has been concentrated on the Venetian island of Murano since the 13th century. Today Murano is known for its art glass, but it has a long history of innovations in glassmaking in addition to its artistic fame—and was Europe's major center for luxury glass from the High Middle Ages to the Italian Renaissance. During the 15th century, Murano glassmakers created cristallo—which was almost transparent and considered the finest glass in the world. Murano glassmakers also developed a white-colored glass (milk glass called lattimo) that looked like porcelain. They later became Europe's finest makers of mirrors.","image":"Vetro_di_murano%2C_vaso_biansato%2C_vetro_trasperente_blu%2C_fine_xvi-inizio_xvii_sec.JPG.webp","url":"Venetian_glass"}
