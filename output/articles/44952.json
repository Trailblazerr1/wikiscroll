{"title":"Thistle, Utah","summary":"Thistle is a ghost town in Spanish Fork Canyon in southeastern Utah County, Utah, United States.[1] During the era of steam locomotives, the town's primary industry was servicing trains for the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (often shortened to D&RG, D&RGW, or Rio Grande). The fortunes of the town were closely linked with those of the railroad until the changeover to diesel locomotives, when the town started to decline.","image":"Thistle-School_house.jpg.webp"}
