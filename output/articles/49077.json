{"title":"Xenon difluoride","summary":"Xenon difluoride is a powerful fluorinating agent with the chemical formula XeF2, and one of the most stable xenon compounds. Like most covalent inorganic fluorides it is moisture-sensitive. It decomposes on contact with water vapor, but is otherwise stable in storage.  Xenon difluoride is a dense, colourless crystalline solid.","image":"XeF2_kristalle.png.webp"}
