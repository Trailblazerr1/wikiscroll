{"title":"CBGB","summary":"CBGB was a New York City music club opened in 1973 by Hilly Kristal in Manhattan's East Village. The club was previously a biker bar and before that was a dive bar.[2] The letters CBGB were for Country, BlueGrass, and Blues, Kristal's original vision, yet CBGB soon became a famed venue of punk rock and new wave bands like the Ramones, Television, Patti Smith Group, Blondie, and Talking Heads.  From the early 1980s onward, CBGB was known for hardcore punk.[3]","image":"CBGB_club_facade.jpg.webp","url":"CBGB"}
