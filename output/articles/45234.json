{"title":"Timeline of the far future","summary":"While the future cannot be predicted with certainty, present understanding in various scientific fields allows for the prediction of some far-future events, if only in the broadest outline.[1][2] These fields include astrophysics, which studies how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia; and sociology, which examines how human societies and cultures evolve.","image":"Red_Giant_Earth_warm.jpg.webp","url":"Timeline_of_the_far_future"}
