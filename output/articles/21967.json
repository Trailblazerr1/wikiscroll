{"title":"Influenza vaccine","summary":"Influenza vaccines, also known as flu jabs or flu shots, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses.[3] New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes.[3] While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza.[3][4] The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths.[5][6] Immunized workers who do catch the flu return to work half a day sooner on average.[7] Vaccine effectiveness in those over 65 years old remains uncertain due to a lack of high-quality research.[8][9] Vaccinating children may protect those around them.[3]","image":"Defense.gov_News_Photo_041028-N-9864S-021.jpg.webp"}
