{"title":"Criticism of communist party rule","summary":"The actions by governments of communist states have been subject to criticism across the political spectrum.[1] According to the critics, the rule by communist parties leads to totalitarianism, political repression, restrictions of human rights, poor economic performance and cultural and artistic censorship.[1][2] Communist party rule has been especially criticized by anti-communists and right-wing critics, but also by other socialists such as anarchists, communists, democratic socialists, libertarian socialists and Marxists. Ruling communist parties have also been challenged by domestic dissent.[3]","image":"Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg.png.webp","url":"Criticism_of_communist_party_rule"}
