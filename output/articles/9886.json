{"title":"Christianization of the Roman Empire","summary":"Christianization of the Roman Empire took place within the ancient pre-Christian spiritual landscape known as paganism (Roman polytheism). For the ancients, many divine beings populated this world, and no one (openly) doubted the god's existence, not even Christians, who only doubted their nature. Roman polytheism was originally a city-based religion. Practitioners demonstrated their support through established protocols and customs such as offerings and festivals. Support for paganism began slowly declining in the two centuries before Christianity, probably due to a combination of external factors such as war and invasions, and internal factors such as traditional polytheism's formal nature and frequent political manipulation. The open nature of Roman polytheism and the importing of foreign cults offered alternatives to traditional polytheism, and this may have also contributed to its decline. Other possible reasons for its decline include the effects of nature through plague, earthquakes and other natural disasters, the rise of secularism, and the advent of Christianity.","image":"Roman_Gods.png.webp"}
