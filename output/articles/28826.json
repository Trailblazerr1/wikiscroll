{"title":"Mass number","summary":"The mass number (symbol A, from the German word Atomgewicht [atomic weight]),[1] also called  atomic mass number or nucleon number, is the total number of protons and neutrons (together known as nucleons) in an atomic nucleus. It is approximately equal to the atomic (also known as isotopic) mass of the atom expressed in atomic mass units. Since protons and neutrons are both baryons, the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B of the nucleus (and also of the whole atom or ion). The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element. Hence, the difference between the mass number and the atomic number Z gives the number of neutrons (N) in a given nucleus: N = A − Z.[2]","image":"NuclearReaction.svg.png.webp","url":"Mass_number"}
