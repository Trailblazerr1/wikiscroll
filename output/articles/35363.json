{"title":"Police Scotland","summary":"Police Scotland (Scottish Gaelic: Poileas Alba), legally named the Police Service of Scotland (Seirbheis Phoilis na h-Alba),[6] is the national police force of Scotland. It was formed in 2013, with the merger of eight regional police forces in Scotland, as well as the specialist services of the Scottish Police Services Authority, including the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency. Although not formally absorbing it, the merger also resulted in the winding up of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland.","image":"Logo_of_Police_Scotland.svg.png.webp"}
