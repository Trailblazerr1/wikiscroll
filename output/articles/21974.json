{"title":"Information asymmetry","summary":"In contract theory and economics, information asymmetry deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other. This asymmetry creates an imbalance of power in transactions, which can sometimes cause the transactions to be inefficient causing market failure in the worst case. Examples of this problem are adverse selection,[1] moral hazard, and monopolies of knowledge.[2]","image":"Balance_of_Power_Graph.jpg.webp"}
