{"title":"Hypotension","summary":"Hypotension is low blood pressure.[1] Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood.[2] Blood pressure is indicated by two numbers, the systolic blood pressure (the top number) and the diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number), which are the maximum and minimum blood pressures, respectively.[3] A systolic blood pressure of less than 90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or diastolic of less than 60Â mm Hg is generally considered to be hypotension.[4][5] Different numbers apply to children.[6] However, in practice, blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present.[7]","image":"Depiction_of_a_hypotension_(low_blood_pressure)_patient_getting_her_blood_pressure_checked.png.webp","url":"Hypotension"}
