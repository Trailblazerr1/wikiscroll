{"title":"Distributism","summary":"Distributism is an economic theory asserting that the world's productive assets should be widely owned rather than concentrated.[1] In its furthest extent some supporters of distributism (to an extent), support the redistribution of the means of production (productive assets) - in some ideological circles the redistribution of wealth - to a wider portion of society instead of concentrating it in the hands of a minority wealth elite as seen in their criticism of capitalism nor concentrating it in the hands of the state as seen in their criticism of communism and socialism.[1][2] On the other hand, more capitalist-oriented supporters support a Distributism-influenced Social Market Economy (also known as Rhine capitalism).[3][4][5][6]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Distributism"}
