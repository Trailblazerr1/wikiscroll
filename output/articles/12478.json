{"title":"Degrowth","summary":"Degrowth (French: d√©croissance) is a term used for both a political, economic, and social movement as well as a set of theories  that critiques the paradigm of economic growth.[1] It is based on ideas from a diverse range of lines of thought such as political ecology, ecological economics, feminist political ecology, and environmental justice, pointing out the social and ecological harm caused by the pursuit of infinite growth and Western \"development\" imperatives.[2] Degrowth emphasizes the need to reduce global consumption and production (social metabolism) and advocates a socially just and ecologically sustainable society with social and environmental well-being replacing GDP as the indicator of prosperity. Hence, although GDP is likely to shrink in a \"Degrowth society\", i.e. a society in which the objectives of the Degrowth movement are achieved, this is not the primary objective of Degrowth.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Degrowth"}
