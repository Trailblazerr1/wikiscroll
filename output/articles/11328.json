{"title":"Countable set","summary":"In mathematics, a set is countable if it has the same cardinality (the number of elements of the set) as some subset of the set of natural numbers N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Equivalently, a set S is countable if there exists an injective function f : S → N from S to N; it simply means that every element in S has the correspondence to a different element in N.","image":"721cd7f8c15a2e72ad162bdfa5baea8eef98aab1.svg"}
