{"title":"Intel 80286","summary":"The Intel 80286[3] (also marketed as the iAPX 286[4] and often called Intel 286) is a 16-bit microprocessor that was introduced on February 1, 1982. It was the first 8086-based CPU with separate, non-multiplexed address and data buses and also the first with memory management and wide protection abilities. The 80286 used approximately 134,000 transistors in its original nMOS (HMOS) incarnation and, just like the contemporary 80186,[5] it could correctly execute most software written for the earlier Intel 8086 and 8088 processors.[6]","image":"KL_Intel_i286.jpg.webp","url":"Intel_80286"}
