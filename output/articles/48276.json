{"title":"Western Ghats","summary":"The Western Ghats, is a mountain range that covers an area of 160,000 km2 (62,000 sq mi) in a stretch of 1,600 km (990 mi) parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula, traversing the states of Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.[1] It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the eight hotspots of biological diversity in the world.[2][3] It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India.[4] It contains a very large proportion of the country's flora and fauna, many of which are only found in India and nowhere else in the world.[5] According to UNESCO, the Western Ghats are older than the Himalayas. They influence Indian monsoon weather patterns by intercepting the rain-laden monsoon winds that sweep in from the south-west during late summer.[1] The range runs north to south along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, and separates the plateau from a narrow coastal plain, called Konkan, along the Arabian Sea. A total of thirty-nine areas in the Western Ghats, including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests, were designated as world heritage sites in 2012 – twenty in Kerala, ten in Karnataka, six in Tamil Nadu and four in Maharashtra.[6][7]","image":"Anamudi_peak%2C_Munnar.jpg.webp"}
