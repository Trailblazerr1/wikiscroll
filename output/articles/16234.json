{"title":"Fire ecology","summary":"Fire ecology is a scientific discipline concerned with natural processes involving fire in an ecosystem and the ecological effects, the interactions between fire and the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, and the role as an ecosystem process. Many ecosystems, particularly prairie, savanna, chaparral and coniferous forests, have evolved with fire as an essential contributor to habitat vitality and renewal.[1] Many plant species in  fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce.  Wildfire suppression not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them.[2]","image":"Wildfire-ISS007_Mosaic2.jpg.webp","url":"Fire_ecology"}
