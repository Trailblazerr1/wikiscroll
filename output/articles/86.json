{"title":"16-bit computing","summary":"In computer architecture, 16-bit integers, memory addresses, or other data units are those that are  16 bits (2 octets) wide.  Also, 16-bit CPU and ALU architectures are those that are based on registers, address buses, or data buses of that size. 16-bit microcomputers are computers in which 16-bit microprocessors were the norm.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
