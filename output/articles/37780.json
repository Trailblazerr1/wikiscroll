{"title":"Reynolds number","summary":"The Reynolds number (Re) helps predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations.  At low Reynolds numbers, flows tend to be dominated by laminar (sheet-like) flow, while at high Reynolds numbers flows tend to be turbulent.  The turbulence results from differences in the fluid's speed and direction, which may sometimes intersect or even move counter to the overall direction of the flow (eddy currents). These eddy currents begin to churn the flow, using up energy in the process, which for liquids increases the chances of cavitation.  Reynolds numbers are an important dimensionless quantity in fluid mechanics.","image":"Laminar-turbulent_transition.jpg.webp","url":"Reynolds_number"}
