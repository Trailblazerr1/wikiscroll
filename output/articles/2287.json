{"title":"Aegis","summary":"The aegis (/ˈiːdʒɪs/ EE-jis;[1] Ancient Greek: αἰγίς aigís), as stated in the Iliad, is a device carried by Athena and Zeus, variously interpreted as an animal skin or a shield and sometimes featuring the head of a Gorgon. There may be a connection with a deity named Aex or Aix, a daughter of Helios and a nurse of Zeus or alternatively a mistress of Zeus (Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 13).[2]","image":"Lemnia_torso04_pushkin.jpg.webp","url":"Aegis"}
