{"title":"Luteinizing hormone","summary":"Luteinizing hormone (LH, also known as lutropin and sometimes lutrophin[1]) is a hormone produced by gonadotropic cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The production of LH is regulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.[2] In females, an acute rise of LH (\"LH surge\") triggers ovulation[3] and development of the corpus luteum. In males, where LH had also been called interstitial cellâ€“stimulating hormone (ICSH),[4] it stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone.[3] It acts synergistically with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).","image":"Figure_28_03_01.jpg.webp","url":"Luteinizing_hormone"}
