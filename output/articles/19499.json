{"title":"Hamlet (place)","summary":"A hamlet is a small human settlement. In different jurisdictions and geographies, a hamlet may be the size of a town,  village or parish, or may be considered to be a smaller settlement or subdivision or satellite entity to a larger settlement. The word and concept of a hamlet have roots in the Anglo-Norman settlement of England, where the old French hamlet came to apply to small human settlements. In British geography, a hamlet is considered smaller than a village and distinctly without a church or other place of worship (e.g. one road or a crossroads, with houses either side).","image":"Waldkirch_Oberwil.jpg.webp","url":"Hamlet_(place)"}
