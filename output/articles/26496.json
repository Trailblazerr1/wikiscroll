{"title":"List of Leeds United F.C. seasons","summary":"Leeds United Football Club were founded in October 1919, taking the place in the Midland League vacated by Leeds City Reserves, and were elected to The Football League for the 1920–21 season.[1] They won the Second Division title four years later to gain promotion to the top tier of English football, but had to wait almost 50 years before winning any major silverware, with success in the 1968 Football League Cup Final accompanied by success in Europe in the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The following season brought league success when Leeds won the First Division championship. Their success continued into the 1970s with victory in the 1971 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, the 1972 FA Cup Final, another league title in the 1973–74 season and runners-up in the 1975 European Cup Final. Leeds won the Second Division title in the 1989–90 season and were promoted back to the First Division. A third league title in the 1991–92 season, a second FA Charity Shield in the 1992 FA Charity Shield and a semi-final appearance in the UEFA Champions League in 2001, preceded a period of turbulence which culminated in relegation to League One in the 2006–07 season. They dropped out of the top two tiers of English football for the first time in their history, in a season that saw them deducted ten points for going into administration.[2] In 2010, Leeds United were promoted back into the Championship. Ten years later, in 2020, the club were promoted back to the Premier League after a 16-year absence.","image":"Bremner_statue.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Leeds_United_F.C._seasons"}
