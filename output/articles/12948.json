{"title":"Dieting","summary":"Dieting is the practice of eating food in a regulated way to decrease, maintain, or increase body weight, or to prevent and treat diseases such as diabetes and obesity. Dieting to lose weight is recommended for people with weight-related health problems, but not otherwise healthy people.[1][2] As weight loss depends on calorie intake, different kinds of calorie-reduced diets, such as those emphasising particular macronutrients (low-fat, low-carbohydrate, etc), have been shown to be no more effective than one another.[3][4][5][6][7] As weight regain is common, diet success is best predicted by long-term adherence.[4][7][8] Regardless, the outcome of a diet can vary widely depending on the individual.[4][9]","image":"William_Banting.png.webp"}
