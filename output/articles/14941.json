{"title":"Enzyme catalysis","summary":"Enzyme catalysis is the increase in the rate of a process by a biological molecule, an \"enzyme\". Most enzymes are proteins, and most such processes are chemical reactions. Within the enzyme, generally catalysis occurs at a localized site, called the active site.","image":"Hexokinase_induced_fit.svg.png.webp","url":"Enzyme_catalysis"}
