{"title":"Kobold","summary":"A kobold (occasionally cobold) is a sprite, originating in ancient Greece as the kobalos (pl. kobaloi) (Ancient Greek: Κόβαλος, plural: Κόβαλοι) which was a sprite, a mischievous creature fond of tricking and frightening mortals, even robbing Heracles/Hercules. Greek myths depict the kobaloi as impudent, thieving, droll, idle, mischievous, gnome-dwarfs, and as funny, little triksy elves of a phallic nature. Depictions of kobaloi are common in ancient Greek art.[1] Having spread into Europe with various spellings including \"goblin\" and \"hobgoblin\", and later taking root and stemming from Germanic mythology, they survived into modern times in German folklore.","image":"Kobold_and_flowers.jpeg.webp"}
