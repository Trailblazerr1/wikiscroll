{"title":"Pseudorandom number generator","summary":"A pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG),[1] is  an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate the properties of sequences of random numbers. The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined by an initial value, called the PRNG's seed (which may include truly random values). Although sequences that are closer to truly random can be generated using hardware random number generators, pseudorandom number generators are important in practice for their speed in number generation and their reproducibility.[2]","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg"}
