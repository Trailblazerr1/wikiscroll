{"title":"List of Liverpool F.C. managers","summary":"Liverpool Football Club is an English association football club based in Liverpool, Merseyside. The club was formed in 1892 following a disagreement between the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. The disagreement between the two parties over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park from Anfield, which left Houlding with no tenant. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C. to play in the empty stadium.[1] Liverpool won the First Division title for the first time in 1901; since then, the club has won a further 18 league titles, along with seven FA Cups and eight Football League Cups. They have also been crowned champions of European football on six occasions by winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019.[2] The club was one of 22 members of the Premier League when it was formed in 1992.","image":"Liverpool_vs._Chelsea%2C_UEFA_Super_Cup_2019-08-14_04.jpg.webp"}
