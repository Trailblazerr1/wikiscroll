{"title":"Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone","summary":"Mediterranean tropical-like cyclones, often referred to as medicanes (a portmanteau of Mediterranean hurricanes) but sometimes also as Mediterranean cyclones or as Mediterranean hurricanes, are meteorological phenomena occasionally observed over the Mediterranean Sea. On a few rare occasions, some storms have been observed reaching the strength of a Category 1 hurricane, on the Saffirâ€“Simpson scale,[1] and one storm has been recorded reaching Category 2 intensity.[2] The main societal hazard posed by medicanes is not usually from destructive winds, but through life-threatening torrential rains and flash floods.","image":"Ianos_2020-09-17_1140Z.jpg.webp"}
