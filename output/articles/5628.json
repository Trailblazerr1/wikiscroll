{"title":"Barnum effect","summary":"The Barnum effect, also called the Forer effect or, less commonly, the Barnumâ€“Forer effect, is a common psychological phenomenon whereby individuals give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically to them, yet which are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people.[1] This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some paranormal beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, aura reading, and some types of personality tests.[1][2]","image":"Baphosimb.svg.png.webp"}
