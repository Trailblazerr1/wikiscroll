{"title":"Articulated bus","summary":"An articulated bus, also referred to as a bendybus, tandem bus, vestibule bus, stretch bus, or an accordion bus, (either a motor bus or trolleybus) is an articulated vehicle used in public transportation. It is usually a single-decker, and comprises two or more rigid sections linked by a pivoting joint (articulation) enclosed by protective bellows inside and outside and a cover plate on the floor. This allows a longer legal length than rigid-bodied buses, and hence a higher passenger capacity (94â€“120),[1][2] while still allowing the bus to maneuver adequately.","image":"Transperth_2015_Volgren_Optimus_bodied_Volvo_B8RLEA_diesel_Rt._530.jpg.webp","url":"Articulated_bus"}
