{"title":"Diverticulosis","summary":"Diverticulosis is the condition of having multiple pouches (diverticula) in the colon that are not inflamed. These are outpockets of the colonic mucosa and submucosa through weaknesses of muscle layers in the colon wall,[1] and may be due in part to low-fiber diet prompting changes in intestinal microflora with consequent low-grade inflammation.[2] Diverticula do not cause symptoms in most people.[3] Diverticular disease occurs when diverticula become clinically inflamed, a condition known as diverticulitis.[4]","image":"Diverticulosis_2.jpg.webp","url":"Diverticulosis"}
