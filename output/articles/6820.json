{"title":"Black Tortoise","summary":"The Black Tortoise or Black Turtle (Chinese: 玄武; pinyin: Xuánwǔ), known in Chinese as Xuanwu, is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese constellations. Despite its English name, it is usually depicted as a turtle entwined together with a snake. Furthermore, in East Asian mythology it is not called after either animal, but is instead known as the \"Black Warrior\" under various local pronunciations. It is known as Xuanwu in Chinese. It represents the north and the winter season, thus it is sometimes called Black Tortoise of the North (Chinese: 北方玄武; pinyin: Běifāng Xuánwǔ).","image":"Wadang-xuanwu.jpg.webp","url":"Black_Tortoise"}
