{"title":"Lawrence v. Texas","summary":"Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that sanctions of criminal punishment for those who commit sodomy are unconstitutional.[1][2] The Court reaffirmed the concept of a \"right to privacy\" that earlier cases, such as Roe v. Wade, had found the U.S. Constitution provides, even though it is not explicitly enumerated.[3] The Court based its ruling on the notions of personal autonomy to define one's own relationships and of American traditions of non-interference with private sexual decisions between consenting adults.[4]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp"}
