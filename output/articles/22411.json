{"title":"Iraqi Turkmen","summary":"Iraqi Turkmen (also spelled as Turkoman and Turcoman; Turkish: Irak Türkmenleri), also referred to as Iraqi Turks,[6] (Arabic: تركمان العراق‎; Turkish: Irak Türkleri) are Iraqis of a Turkic ethnicity, language, and origin.[7] The precise historical origins of the Iraqi Turkmens as a distinct ethnic group is an under-researched field and subject to debate, however Turkic migration to Mesopotamia, Syria and Eastern Anatolia dates back to the 7th century. Additionally, there were several centuries of rule over these areas by the Ottoman Empire, where it would seem the numbers of those who identified as Turks - especially in the cities (Kirkuk and Mosul in particular) - increased.[8][9][10]","image":"Flag_of_the_Iraqi_Turkmen_Front.svg.png.webp"}
