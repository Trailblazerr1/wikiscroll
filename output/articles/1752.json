{"title":"ATLAS experiment","summary":"ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS)[1] is the largest, general-purpose particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland.[2] The experiment is designed to take advantage of the unprecedented energy available at the LHC and observe phenomena that involve highly massive particles which were not observable using earlier lower-energy accelerators. ATLAS was one of the two LHC experiments involved in the discovery of the Higgs boson in July 2012.[3][4] It was also designed to search for evidence of theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.","image":"CERN_ATLAS_Detector.jpg.webp","url":"ATLAS_experiment"}
