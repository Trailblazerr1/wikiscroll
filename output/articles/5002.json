{"title":"Austrian German","summary":"Austrian German[2] (German: Österreichisches Deutsch), Austrian Standard German (ASG),[3][4] Standard Austrian German[5] (Österreichisches Standarddeutsch), or Austrian High German[2][6] (Österreichisches Hochdeutsch), is the variety of Standard German written and spoken in Austria. It has the highest sociolinguistic prestige locally, as it is the variation used in the media and for other formal situations. In less formal situations, Austrians tend to use forms closer to or identical with the Bavarian and Alemannic dialects, traditionally spoken – but rarely written – in Austria.","image":"Flag_of_Austria.svg.png.webp","url":"Austrian_German"}
