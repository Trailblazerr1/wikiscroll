{"title":"Ammeter","summary":"An ammeter /ˈamɪtə/ (abbreviation of Ampere meter) is a measuring instrument used to measure the current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in Amperes (A), hence the name. The ammeter is usually connected in series with the circuit in which the current is to be measured. An ammeter usually has low resistance so that it does not cause a significant voltage drop in the circuit being measured.","image":"Amperemeter_hg.jpg.webp","url":"Ammeter"}
