{"title":"BlackBerry","summary":"BlackBerry is a brand of smartphones, tablets, and services originally designed and marketed by Canadian company BlackBerry Limited (formerly known as Research In Motion, or RIM).[1] Beginning in 2016, BlackBerry Limited licensed third-party companies to design, manufacture, and market smartphones under the BlackBerry brand. The original licensors were BB Merah Putih for the Indonesian market, Optiemus Infracom for the South Asian market, and BlackBerry Mobile (a trade name of TCL Technology) for all other markets.[2][3] In summer 2020, the Texas-based startup OnwardMobility signed a new licensing agreement with BlackBerry Limited to develop a new 5G BlackBerry Smartphone. The device, which will probably be released in 2021, is expected to have flagship specifications and a BlackBerry-typical physical keyboard. For the creation of the new BlackBerry-branded smartphones, OnwardMobility is cooperating with BlackBerry Limited and FIH Mobile (a subsidiary of Foxconn).[4]","image":"Blackberry_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
