{"title":"Immigration history of Australia","summary":"The immigration history of Australia began with the initial human migration to the continent around 80,000 years ago[1] when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians arrived on the continent via the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia and New Guinea.[2] From the early 17th century onwards, the continent experienced the first coastal landings and exploration by European explorers. Permanent European settlement began in 1788 with the establishment of a British penal colony in New South Wales. From early federation in 1901, Australia maintained the White Australia Policy, which was abolished after World War II, heralding the modern era of multiculturalism in Australia. From the late 1970s there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries.","image":"StateLibQld_1_110096_Drawing_of_migrants_disembarking_from_a_ship%2C_ca._1885.jpg.webp","url":"Immigration_history_of_Australia"}
