{"title":"Samaria","summary":"Samaria[lower-alpha 1] (/səˈmɛəriə/)[1] is a historical and biblical name used for the central region of the Land of Israel, bordered by Galilee to the north and Judaea to the south.[2][3] For the beginning of the Common Era, Josephus set the Mediterranean Sea as its limit to the west, and the Jordan River as its limit to the east.[3] Its territory largely corresponds to the biblical allotments of the tribe of Ephraim and the western half of Manasseh; after the death of Solomon and the splitting-up of his empire into the southern Kingdom of Judah and the northern Kingdom of Israel, this territory constituted the southern part of the Kingdom of Israel.[2] The border between Samaria and Judea is set at the latitude of Ramallah.[4]","image":"גבעות_יצהר.JPG.webp","url":"Samaria"}
