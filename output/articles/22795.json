{"title":"Jacob","summary":"Jacob (/ˈdʒeɪkəb/; Hebrew: יַעֲקֹב‎, Modern: Ya'aqōv , Tiberian: Ya'ăqōḇ; Arabic: يَعْقُوب‎, romanized: Yaʿqūb; Greek: Ἰακώβ, romanized: Iakṓb),[1] later given the name Israel, is regarded as a patriarch of the Israelites and is an important figure in Abrahamic religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Jacob first appears in the Book of Genesis, where he is described as the son of Isaac and Rebecca, and the grandson of Abraham, Sarah and Bethuel. According to the biblical account, he was the second-born of Isaac's children, the elder being Jacob's fraternal twin brother, Esau. Jacob is said to have bought Esau's birthright and, with his mother's help, deceived his aging father to bless him instead of Esau.[2] Later in the narrative, following a severe drought in his homeland of Canaan, Jacob and his descendants, with the help of his son Joseph (who had become a confidante of the pharaoh), moved to Egypt where Jacob died at the age of 147. He is supposed to have been buried in the Cave of Machpelah.","image":"Rembrandt_-_Jacob_Wrestling_with_the_Angel_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp","url":"Jacob"}
