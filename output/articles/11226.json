{"title":"Cornmeal","summary":"Cornmeal  is a meal (coarse flour) ground from dried corn. It is a common staple food, and is ground to coarse, medium, and fine consistencies, but not as fine as wheat flour can be.[1] In Mexico, very finely ground cornmeal is referred to as corn flour.[1] When fine cornmeal is made from maize that has been soaked in an alkaline solution, e.g., limewater (a process known as nixtamalization), it is called masa harina (or masa flour), which is used for making arepas, tamales and tortillas. Boiled cornmeal is called polenta in Italy and is also a traditional dish and bread substitute in Romania.","image":"Polenta_uncooked.jpg.webp"}
