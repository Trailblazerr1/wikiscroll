{"title":"Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)","summary":"The Kingdom of Hungary between 1526 and 1867 existed as a state outside the Holy Roman Empire,[lower-alpha 1] but part of the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy that became the Austrian Empire in 1804. After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the country was ruled by two crowned kings (John I and Ferdinand I). Initially, the exact territory under Habsburg rule was disputed because both rulers claimed the whole kingdom. This unsettled period lasted until 1570 when John Sigismund Zápolya (John II) abdicated as King of Hungary in Emperor Maximilian II's favor.","image":"Flag_of_the_Habsburg_Monarchy.svg.png.webp","url":"Kingdom_of_Hungary_(1526–1867)"}
