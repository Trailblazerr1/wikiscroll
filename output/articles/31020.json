{"title":"Myers–Briggs Type Indicator","summary":"In personality typology, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.[1][2][3] The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, such as \"INFJ\" or \"ENFP\".","image":"MyersBriggsTypes.png.webp","url":"Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator"}
