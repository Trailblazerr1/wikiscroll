{"title":"Varicocele","summary":"A varicocele is an abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum. This plexus of veins drains blood from the testicles back to the heart. The vessels originate in the abdomen and course down through the inguinal canal as part of the spermatic cord on their way to the testis. Varicoceles occur in around 15% to 20% of all men.[3][4] The incidence of varicocele increase with age.","image":"Photo_légendé_d'une_Varicocèle.jpg.webp","url":"Varicocele"}
