{"title":"Von Willebrand disease","summary":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common hereditary blood-clotting disorder in humans. An acquired form can sometimes result from other medical conditions.[1] It arises from a deficiency in the quality or quantity of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion. It is known to affect several breeds of dogs as well as humans. The three forms of VWD are hereditary, acquired, and pseudo or platelet type. The three types of hereditary VWD are VWD type 1, VWD type 2, and VWD type 3. Type 2 contains various subtypes.[2] Platelet type VWD is also an inherited condition.[3]","image":"Autosomal_dominant_-_en.svg.png.webp","url":"Von_Willebrand_disease"}
