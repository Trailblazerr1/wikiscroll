{"title":"Adultery","summary":"Adultery (from Latin adulterium) is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Although the sexual activities that constitute adultery vary, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and is similar in Christianity, Judaism and Islam.[1] Adultery is viewed by many jurisdictions as offensive to public morals, undermining the marriage relationship.[2][3]","image":"Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Adultery"}
