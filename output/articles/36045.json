{"title":"Priming (psychology)","summary":"Priming is a phenomenon whereby exposure to one stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention.[1][2] For example, the word NURSE is recognized more quickly following the word DOCTOR than following the word BREAD. Priming can be perceptual, associative, repetitive, positive, negative, affective, semantic, or conceptual. Research, however, has yet to firmly establish the duration of priming effects,[3][4] yet their onset can be almost instantaneous.[5]","image":"Priming_Web_Diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Priming_(psychology)"}
