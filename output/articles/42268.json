{"title":"Stereotype","summary":"Social psychology defines a stereotype as a generalized belief about a particular category of people.[2] It is an expectation that people might have about every person of a particular group. The type of expectation can vary; it can be, for example, an expectation about the group's personality, preferences, appearance or ability.  Stereotypes are sometimes overgeneralized, inaccurate, and resistant to new information, but can sometimes be accurate.[3]","image":"ProhibitionSign.svg.png.webp","url":"Stereotype"}
