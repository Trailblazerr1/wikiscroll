{"title":"Preparatory school (United Kingdom)","summary":"A preparatory school (or, shortened: prep school) in the United Kingdom is a fee-charging independent primary school that caters for children up to approximately the age of 13.  The term \"preparatory school\" is used as it prepares the children for the Common Entrance Examination in order to secure a place at an independent secondary school, typically one of the English public schools.[1]  They are also preferred by parents in the hope of getting their child into a  state selective grammar school.[1] Most prep schools are inspected by the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI), which is overseen by Ofsted on behalf of the Department for Education.[2]","image":"Lambrook_School.jpg.webp","url":"Preparatory_school_(United_Kingdom)"}
