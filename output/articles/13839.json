The experienced trekking group from the Ural Polytechnical Institute, led by Igor Dyatlov, had established a camp on the eastern slopes of Kholat Syakhl. During the night, something caused them to cut their way out of their tent and flee the campsite while inadequately dressed for the heavy snowfall and subzero temperatures.","image":"Памятник_дятловцам_на_Михайловском_кладбище.jpg.webp","url":"Dyatlov_Pass_incident"}
