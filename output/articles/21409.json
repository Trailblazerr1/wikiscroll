{"title":"iPad Pro","summary":"iPad Pro is a premium professional sub-lineup of the iPad tablet computers by Apple Inc.. It runs iPadOS, an optimized derivation from the predecessor iOS. The original iPad Pro was introduced in September 2015 which was originally based in iOS 9; the second generation, unveiled in June 2017, made uses of an upgraded A10X Fusion chip with an extended 10.5-inch screen display. The home button was eliminated following the third lineup (October 2018) for a full display at 11-inch, and it features an array sensor Face ID capable of performing unlocking at wide angles. The fourth-lineup, introduced in March 2020, included the A12Z chip with added compatibility to the Magic Keyboard. The current model fifth generation was announced in April 2021, incorporating a desktop-class SoC Apple silicon M1 chip, marking the first model to not use an A-series processor.","image":"IPad_Pro_(2017-present%2C_logo).svg.png.webp","url":"IPad_Pro"}
