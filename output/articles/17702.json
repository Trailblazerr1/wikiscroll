{"title":"Gentoo penguin","summary":"The gentoo penguin (/ˈdʒɛntuː/ JEN-too) (Pygoscelis papua) is a penguin species (or possibly a species complex) in the genus Pygoscelis, most closely related to the Adélie penguin (P. adeliae) and the chinstrap penguin (P. antarcticus). The earliest scientific description was made in 1781 by Johann Reinhold Forster with a type locality in the Falkland Islands. The species calls in a variety of ways, but the most frequently heard is a loud trumpeting, which the bird emits with its head thrown back.[2]","image":"Brown_Bluff-2016-Tabarin_Peninsula–Gentoo_penguin_(Pygoscelis_papua)_03.jpg.webp","url":"Gentoo_penguin"}
