{"title":"Common toad","summary":"The common toad, European toad, or in Anglophone parts of Europe, simply the toad (Bufo bufo, from Latin bufo \"toad\"), is an amphibian found throughout most of Europe (with the exception of Ireland, Iceland, and some Mediterranean islands), in the western part of North Asia, and in a small portion of Northwest Africa. It is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of toads and which form a species complex. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the invertebrates on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.","image":"Bufo_bufo_sitting-Iric2006.jpg.webp"}
