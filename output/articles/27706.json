{"title":"Lynyrd Skynyrd","summary":"Lynyrd Skynyrd (/ˌlɛnərd ˈskɪnərd/ LEN-ərd SKIN-ərd)[2] is an American rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida. The group originally formed as My Backyard in 1964 and comprised Ronnie Van Zant (lead vocalist), Gary Rossington (guitar), Allen Collins (guitar), Larry Junstrom (bass guitar) and Bob Burns (drums).  The band spent five years touring small venues under various names and with several lineup changes before deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1969. The band released its first album in 1973, having settled on a lineup that included bassist Leon Wilkeson, keyboardist Billy Powell and guitarist Ed King. Burns left and was replaced by Artimus Pyle in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by Steve Gaines in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the Southern rock genre with songs such as \"Sweet Home Alabama\" and \"Free Bird\". After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band's career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when their chartered airplane crashed, killing Van Zant, Gaines, and backup singer Cassie Gaines, and seriously injuring the rest of the band.","image":"Hellfest2019LynyrdSkynyrd_07.jpg.webp"}
