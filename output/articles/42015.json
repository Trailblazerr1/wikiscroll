{"title":"Staple food","summary":"A staple food, food staple, or simply a staple, is a food that is eaten routinely and in such quantities that it constitutes a dominant portion of a standard diet for a given person, supplying a large fraction of energy needs and generally forming a significant proportion of the intake of other nutrients as well.[1]  A staple food of a specific society may be eaten as often as every day or every meal, and most people live on a diet based on just a small number of food staples.[2] Specific staples vary from place to place, but typically are inexpensive or readily available foods that supply one or more of the macronutrients and micronutrients needed for survival and health: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, and vitamins.[1] Typical examples include tubers and roots, grains, legumes, and seeds. Among them, cereals, legumes, tubers and roots account for about 90% of the world's food calories intake.[1]","image":"Various_types_of_potatoes_for_sale.jpg.webp","url":"Staple_food"}
