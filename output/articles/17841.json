{"title":"George Stephenson","summary":"George Stephenson (9 June 1781 – 12 August 1848) was a British civil engineer and mechanical engineer. Renowned as the \"Father of Railways\",[1] Stephenson was considered by the Victorians a great example of diligent application and thirst for improvement. Self-help advocate Samuel Smiles particularly praised his achievements. His chosen rail gauge, sometimes called 'Stephenson gauge',[lower-roman 1] was the basis for the 4 feet 8+1⁄2 inches (1.435 m) standard gauge used by most of the world's railways.","image":"GeorgeStephenson.PNG.webp","url":"George_Stephenson"}
