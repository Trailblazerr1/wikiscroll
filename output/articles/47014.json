{"title":"Vaccine hesitancy","summary":"Vaccine hesitancy is a delay in acceptance, or refusal of vaccines despite the availability of vaccine services. The term covers outright refusals to vaccinate, delaying vaccines, accepting vaccines but remaining uncertain about their use, or using certain vaccines but not others.[1][2][3][4] \"Anti-vaccinationism\" refers to total opposition to vaccination; in more recent years, anti-vaccinationists have been known as \"anti-vaxxers\" or \"anti-vax\".[5] Vaccine hesitancy is complex and context-specific, varying across time, place and vaccines.[6] It can be influenced by factors such as lack of proper scientifically-based knowledge and understanding about how vaccines are made or how vaccines work, complacency, convenience, or even fear of needles.[2]","image":"Outline-body-aura.svg.png.webp"}
