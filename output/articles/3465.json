{"title":"Anarcho-capitalism","summary":"Anarcho-capitalism is a political philosophy and economic theory that advocates the elimination of centralized states in favor of a system of private property enforced by private agencies, free markets and the right-libertarian interpretation of self-ownership, which extends the concept to include control of private property as part of the self. In the absence of statute, anarcho-capitalists (or ancaps)[1] hold that society tends to contractually self-regulate and civilize through participation in the free market which they describe as a voluntary society.[2][3][4] In a theoretical anarcho-capitalist society, the system of private property would still exist and be enforced by private defense agencies and insurance companies selected by customers which would operate competitively in a market and fulfill the roles of courts and the police.[4][5][6]","image":"Flag_of_Anarcho-capitalism.svg.png.webp"}
