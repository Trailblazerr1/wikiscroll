{"title":"Kiel Canal","summary":"The Kiel Canal (German: Nord-Ostsee-Kanal, literally \"North-[to]-East [Baltic] Sea canal\", formerly known as the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Kanal) is a 98-kilometre-long (61 mi) freshwater canal in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. The canal was finished in 1895, but later widened, and links the North Sea at Brunsbüttel to the Baltic Sea at Kiel-Holtenau. An average of 250 nautical miles (460 km) is saved by using the Kiel Canal instead of going around the Jutland Peninsula. This not only saves time but also avoids storm-prone seas and having to pass through the Danish straits.","image":"Map_of_the_Kiel_Canal.png.webp"}
