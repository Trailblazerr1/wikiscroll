{"title":"Gran Colombia","summary":"Gran Colombia (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈɡɾaŋ koˈlombja] (listen), \"Great Colombia\"), also known as the Greater Colombia, and at the time known as the Republic of Colombia (Spanish: República de Colombia), was a state that encompassed much of northern South America and part of southern Central America from 1819 to 1831. It included present-day Colombia, mainland Ecuador (i.e. excluding the Galapagos Islands), Panama, and Venezuela, along with parts of northern Peru and northwestern Brazil. The terms Gran Colombia and Greater Colombia are used historiographically to distinguish it from the current Republic of Colombia,[2] which is also the official name of the former state.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
