{"title":"Victoria Cross","summary":"The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest and most prestigious award of the British honours system. It is awarded for valour \"in the presence of the enemy\" to members of the British Armed Forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two-thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.","image":"Victoria_Cross_2.jpg.webp","url":"Victoria_Cross"}
