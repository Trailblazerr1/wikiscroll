{"title":"Cumin","summary":"Cumin (/ˈkjuːmɪn/[2][3] or US: /ˈkuːmɪn/,[2][4][5][6] or /ˈkʌmɪn/[2][3]) (Cuminum cyminum) is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, native to the Irano-Turanian Region.[7] Its seeds – each one contained within a fruit, which is dried – are used in the cuisines of many cultures in both whole and ground form. Although cumin is thought to have uses in traditional medicine, there is no high-quality evidence that it is safe or effective as a therapeutic agent.[8]","image":"Cuminum_cyminum_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-198.jpg.webp","url":"Cumin"}
