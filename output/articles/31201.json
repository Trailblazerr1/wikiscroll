{"title":"Name of Canada","summary":"While a variety of theories have been postulated for the  name of Canada, its origin is now accepted as coming from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata, meaning \"village\" or \"settlement\".[1] In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona.[2] Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona (the chief at Stadacona);[2] by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada.[2]","image":"Dauphin_Map_of_Canada_-_circa_1543_-_Project_Gutenberg_etext_20110.jpg.webp","url":"Name_of_Canada"}
