{"title":"Love Story (Taylor Swift song)","summary":"\"Love Story\" is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on September 15, 2008, by Big Machine Records, as the lead single from Swift's second studio album Fearless (2008). Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman, the song was inspired by a love interest of Swift who was unpopular to her family and friends. Swift based the song's narrative on the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), as told from the perspective of Juliet, but replaced the play's tragic conclusion with a happy ending. Musically, \"Love Story\" is a midtempo country pop song featuring soprano vocals and a slow-building melody.","image":"Taylor_Swift_-_Love_Story.png.webp"}
