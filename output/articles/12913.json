{"title":"Dido","summary":"Dido (/ˈdaɪdoʊ/ DY-doh; Ancient Greek: Διδώ Greek pronunciation: [diː.dɔ̌ː], Latin pronunciation: [ˈdiːdoː]), also known as Alyssa or Elissa (/iːˈlɪsə/ ə-LISS-ə, Ἔλισσα),[1] was the legendary foundress and first queen of the Phoenician city-state of Carthage, located in modern Tunisia. Known only through ancient Greek and Roman sources, most of which were written well after Carthage's founding, her historicity remains uncertain. In most accounts, she was the queen of the Phoenician city-state of Tyre, today Ṣūr in Lebanon, who flees tyranny to found her own city in northwest Africa.","image":"Guérin_Énée_racontant_à_Didon_les_malheurs_de_la_ville_de_Troie_Louvre_5184.jpg.webp","url":"Dido"}
