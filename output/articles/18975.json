{"title":"Grenade","summary":"A grenade is an explosive weapon typically thrown by hand (also called by the retronym hand grenade), but can also refer to a shell (explosive projectile) shot from the muzzle of a rifle (as a rifle grenade) or a grenade launcher. A modern hand grenade generally consists of an explosive charge (\"filler\"), a detonator mechanism, an internal striker to trigger the detonator, and a safety lever secured by a linchpin. The user removes the safety pin before throwing, and once the grenade leaves the hand the safety lever gets released, allowing the striker to trigger a primer that ignites a fuze (sometimes called the delay element), which burns down to the detonator and explodes the main charge.","image":"DM51_2_noBG.jpg.webp"}
