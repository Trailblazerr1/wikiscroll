{"title":"Copán","summary":"Copán is an archaeological site of the Maya civilization in the Copán Department of western Honduras, not far from the border with Guatemala.  This ancient Maya city mirrors the beauty of the physical landscape in which it flourished—a fertile, well-watered mountain valley in western Honduras at an elevation of 600 meters (2,400 feet) above mean sea level.[2]  It was the capital city of a major Classic period kingdom from the 5th to 9th centuries AD. The city was in the extreme southeast of the Mesoamerican cultural region, on the frontier with the Isthmo-Colombian cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-Maya peoples.[3]","image":"Copan_sculpture.jpg.webp","url":"Copán"}
