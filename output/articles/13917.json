{"title":"ESRB re-rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion","summary":"In May 2006, the North American Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) changed the rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, a video game for PCs, the Xbox 360, and eventually (after the change took place) the PlayStation 3, from \"Teen\" (13+) to \"Mature\" (17+). The ESRB cited the presence of content not considered in their original review in the published edition of Oblivion. This included detailed depictions of blood and gore and sexually explicit content. The sexually explicit content was an art file, made accessible by a third-party modification called the Oblivion Topless Mod, that rendered the game with topless female characters.","image":"Corpse_of_Lucien_Lachance._Oblivion_2007-07-11.png.webp"}
