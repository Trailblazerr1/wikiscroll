{"title":"Hungarian names","summary":"Hungarian names include surnames and given names. Occasionally there are more than one of the latter, but normally just one is used. In the Hungarian language, whether written or spoken, these names are invariably given in the \"Eastern name order\", or family name followed by given name (in foreign-language texts, names are often given with the family name last). The Hungarian language is one of the few national languages in Europe to use the Eastern name order, among languages like Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and some Basque nationalists.[1]","image":"Specialkeys_hungarian_keyboard.svg.png.webp","url":"Hungarian_names"}
