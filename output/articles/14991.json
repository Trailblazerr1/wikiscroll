{"title":"Epithelium","summary":"Epithelium /ˌɛpɪˈθiːliəm/[1] is one of the four basic types of animal tissue, along with connective tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. It is a thin, continuous, protective layer of compactly packed cells with little intercellular matrix. Epithelial tissues line the outer surfaces of organs and blood vessels throughout the body, as well as the inner surfaces of cavities in many internal organs. An example is the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin.","image":"Illu_epithelium.jpg.webp"}
