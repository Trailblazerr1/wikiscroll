{"title":"End user","summary":"In product development, an end user (sometimes end-user)[lower-alpha 1] is a person who ultimately uses or is intended to ultimately use a product.[1][2][3] The end user stands in contrast to users who support or maintain the product,[4] such as sysops, system administrators, database administrators,[5] information technology experts, software professionals and computer technicians. End users typically do not possess the technical understanding or skill of the product designers,[6] a fact easily overlooked and forgotten by designers: leading to features creating low  customer satisfaction.[2] In information technology, end users are not \"customers\" in the usual senseâ€”they are typically employees of the customer.[7] For example, if a large retail corporation buys a software package for its employees to use, even though the large retail corporation was the \"customer\" which purchased the software, the end users are the employees of the company, who will use the software at work.","image":"Nurses_in_a_nurses'_station%2C_USA_1987.jpg.webp","url":"End_user"}
