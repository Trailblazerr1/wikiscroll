{"title":"Jallianwala Bagh massacre","summary":"The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place on 13 April 1919. A large but peaceful crowd had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab to protest against the arrest of pro-Indian independence leaders Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlew and Dr. Satya Pal. In response to the public gathering, the British Brigadier-General R. E. H. Dyer surrounded the Bagh with his soldiers. The Jallianwala Bagh could only be exited on one side, as its other three sides were enclosed by buildings. After blocking the exit with his troops, he ordered them to shoot at the crowd, continuing to fire even as the protestors tried to flee. The troops kept on firing until their ammunition was exhausted.[4] Estimates of those killed vary between 379 and 1500+ people [1] and over 1,200 other people were injured of whom 192 were seriously injured.[5][6]","image":"Jalian_Wala_Bagh_Memorial_311.jpg.webp","url":"Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre"}
