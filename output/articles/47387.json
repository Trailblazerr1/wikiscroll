{"title":"Video game genre","summary":"A video game genre is a classification assigned to a video game based on its core gameplay (type of interaction) rather than visual or narrative features.[1][2] A video game genre is  normally defined by a set of gameplay challenges considered independently of setting or game-world content, unlike works of fiction that are expressed through other media, such as films or books. For example, a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of where or when it takes place.[3][4]","image":"RosAsmGameSpace.png.webp","url":"Video_game_genre"}
