{"title":"Opiate","summary":"An opiate, in classical pharmacology, is a substance derived from opium. In more modern usage, the term opioid is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors in the brain (including antagonists).[1] Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant Papaver somniferum.[2] The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. Opiates have long been used for a variety of medical conditions with evidence of opiate trade and use for pain relief as early as the eighth century AD.[3] Opiates are considered drugs with moderate to high abuse potential and are listed on various \"Substance-Control Schedules\" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States of America.","image":"Harvesting_opium.jpg.webp","url":"Opiate"}
