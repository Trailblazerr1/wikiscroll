{"title":"Tomb of Tutankhamun","summary":"The tomb of young pharaoh Tutankhamun (designated KV62 in Egyptology) is located in the Valley of the Kings, near Thebes, Egypt (modern-day Luxor). It is renowned for the wealth of valuable antiquities that it contained.[1] Howard Carter discovered it in 1922 underneath the remains of workmen's huts built during the Ramesside Period; this explains why it was largely spared the desecration and tomb clearances at the end of the 20th Dynasty, although it was robbed and resealed twice in the period after its completion.","image":"Inside_Pharaoh_Tutankhamun's_tomb%2C_18th_dynasty.jpg.webp","url":"Tomb_of_Tutankhamun"}
