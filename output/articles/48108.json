{"title":"Weather front","summary":"A weather front is a boundary separating air masses of several characteristics such as air density, wind, and humidity. Disturbed weather often arises from these differences. For instance, cold fronts can bring bands of thunderstorms or be preceded by  squall lines, while warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. In summer, subtler humidity gradients known as dry lines can trigger severe weather. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift.[1]","image":"Unusually_well_defined_warm_front.jpg.webp"}
