{"title":"Taika Reform","summary":"The Taika Reforms (大化の改新, \"Taika no Kaishin, Reformation of Taika\") were a set of doctrines established by Emperor Kōtoku (孝徳天皇 Kōtoku tennō) in the year 645. They were written shortly after the death of Prince Shōtoku and the defeat of the Soga clan (蘇我氏 Soga no uji), uniting Japan. The reforms also artistically marked the end of the Asuka period and the beginning of the Hakuhō period.[1][2] Crown Prince Naka no Ōe (the future Emperor Tenji),Nakatomi no Kamatari, and Emperor Kōtoku jointly embarked on the details of the Reforms. Emperor Kōtoku then announced the era of \"Taika\" (大化), or \"Great Reform\".","image":"Irukaansatsuzu.jpg.webp","url":"Taika_Reform"}
