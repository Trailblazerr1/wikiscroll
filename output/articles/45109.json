The King of Rohan and Lord of the Mark or of the Riddermark, names used by the Rohirrim for their land, he appears as a major supporting character in The Two Towers and The Return of the King. When first introduced, Théoden is weak with age and sorrow and the machinations of his top advisor, Gríma Wormtongue, and he does nothing as his kingdom is crumbling.
