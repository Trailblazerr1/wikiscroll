{"title":"Chinese character classification","summary":"All Chinese characters are logograms, but several different types can be identified, based on the manner in which they are formed or derived. There are a handful which derive from pictographs (象形; xiàngxíng) and a number which are ideographic (指事; zhǐshì) in origin, including compound ideographs (會意; huìyì), but the vast majority originated as phono-semantic compounds (形聲; xíngshēng). The other categories in the traditional system of classification are rebus or phonetic loan characters (假借; jiǎjiè) and \"derivative cognates\" (轉注; zhuǎn zhù). Modern scholars have proposed various revised systems, rejecting some of the traditional categories.","image":"日-oracle.svg.png.webp","url":"Chinese_character_classification"}
