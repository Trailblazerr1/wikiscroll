{"title":"List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Avon","summary":"This is a list of the Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the former county of Avon, England, United Kingdom. In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is Natural England, which chooses a site because of its fauna, flora, geological or physiographical features.[1] Although the county of Avon no longer exists, Natural England still uses its former borders to mark one of its Areas of Search. As of 2006, there are 86 sites designated in this Area of Search, of which 38 have been designated due to their biological interest, 39 due to their geological interest, and 9 for both.[2]","image":"Bristol_ag_from_csb_041004.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Sites_of_Special_Scientific_Interest_in_Avon"}
