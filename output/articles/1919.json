{"title":"Abiogenesis","summary":"In biology, abiogenesis, or informally the origin of life (OoL),[3][4][5][lower-alpha 1] is the natural process by which life has arisen from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds.[6][4][7][8] While the details of this process are still unknown, the prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but an evolutionary process of increasing complexity that involved molecular self-replication, self-assembly, autocatalysis, and the emergence of cell membranes.[9][10][11] Although the occurrence of abiogenesis is uncontroversial among scientists, its possible mechanisms are poorly understood. There are several principles and hypotheses for how abiogenesis could have occurred.[12]","image":"Champagne_vent_white_smokers.jpg.webp","url":"Abiogenesis"}
