{"title":"The Three Stooges","summary":"The Three Stooges were an American vaudeville and comedy team active from 1922 until 1970, best remembered for their 190 short subject films by Columbia Pictures. Their hallmark styles were physical farce and slapstick. Six Stooges appeared over the act's run (with only three active at any given time): Moe Howard (true name (t/n) Moses Horwitz) and Larry Fine (t/n Louis Feinberg) were mainstays throughout the ensemble's nearly 50-year run and the pivotal \"third stooge\" was played by (in order of appearance) Shemp Howard (t/n Samuel Horwitz), Curly Howard (t/n Jerome Horwitz), Shemp Howard again, Joe Besser, and \"Curly Joe\" DeRita.","image":"Three_Stooges_1937.jpg.webp"}
