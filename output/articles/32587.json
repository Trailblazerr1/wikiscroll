{"title":"Nyquist stability criterion","summary":"In control theory and stability theory, the Nyquist stability criterion or Streckerâ€“Nyquist stability criterion, independently discovered by the German electrical engineer Felix Strecker at Siemens in 1930[1][2][3] and the Swedish-American electrical engineer Harry Nyquist at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1932,[4] is a graphical technique for determining the stability of a dynamical system. Because it only looks at the Nyquist plot of the open loop systems, it can be applied without explicitly computing the poles and zeros of either the closed-loop or open-loop system (although the number of each type of right-half-plane singularities must be known). As a result, it can be applied to systems defined by non-rational functions, such as systems with delays. In contrast to Bode plots, it can handle transfer functions with right half-plane singularities. In addition, there is a natural generalization to more complex systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, such as control systems for airplanes.","image":"Nyquist_example.svg.png.webp"}
