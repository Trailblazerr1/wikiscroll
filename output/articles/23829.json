{"title":"John Wycliffe","summary":"John Wycliffe (/ˈwɪklɪf/; also spelled Wyclif, Wickliffe, and other variants; c. 1320s – 31 December 1384)[2] was an English scholastic philosopher, theologian, biblical translator, reformer, priest, and a seminary professor at the University of Oxford. He became an influential dissident within the Roman Catholic priesthood during the 14th century and is considered an important predecessor to Protestantism. Wycliffe questioned the privileged status of the clergy which had bolstered their powerful role in England and the luxury and pomp of local parishes and their ceremonies.[3]","image":"John_Wycliffe-The_Morningstar_of_Protestant_Reformation_1320_to_1384.jpg.webp"}
