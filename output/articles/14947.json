{"title":"Eosinophilic esophagitis","summary":"Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus that involves eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.  In healthy individuals, the esophagus is typically devoid of eosinophils.[2] In EoE, eosinophils migrate to the esophagus in large numbers. When a trigger food is eaten, the eosinophils contribute to tissue damage and inflammation. Symptoms include swallowing difficulty, food impaction, vomiting, and heartburn.[3]","image":"Eosinophilic_esophagitis_-_very_high_mag.jpg.webp","url":"Eosinophilic_esophagitis"}
