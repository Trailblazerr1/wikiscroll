{"title":"Scientism","summary":"Scientism is the view that science is the best or only objective means by which society should determine normative and epistemological values. While the term was originally defined to mean \"methods and attitudes typical of or attributed to the natural scientist\", some religious scholars (and subsequently many others) adopted it as a pejorative with the meaning \"an exaggerated trust in the efficacy of the methods of natural science applied to all areas of investigation (as in philosophy, the social sciences, and the humanities)\".[1]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
