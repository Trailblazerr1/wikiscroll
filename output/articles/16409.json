{"title":"Flag of West Virginia","summary":"The flag of West Virginia is the official flag of the U.S. state of West Virginia and was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7, 1929. The present flag consists of a pure white field bordered by a blue stripe with the coat of arms of West Virginia in the center, wreathed by Rhododendron maximum and topped by an unfurled red ribbon reading, \"State of West Virginia.\" It is the only state flag to bear crossing rifles, meant to illustrate the importance of the state's fight for liberty during the Civil War as the southern unionist 35th state.[1][2]","image":"Flag_of_West_Virginia.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_West_Virginia"}
