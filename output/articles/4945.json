{"title":"Aurochs","summary":"The aurochs[lower-alpha 1] (Bos primigenius) (/ˈɔːrɒks/ or /ˈaʊrɒks/), also known as aurochsen, urus or ure, is a species of large wild cattle that inhabited Asia, Europe and North Africa. Whilst the wild subspecies, including the nominal subspecies Bos primigenius primigenius, is extinct, there are extant domestic cattle which are considered subspecies of the aurochs. Further discussion and use of the term \"aurochs\" in this article will, for simplicity, refer only to the extinct wild subspecies unless otherwise specified. Bos primigenius primigenius survived in Europe until 1627, when the last recorded aurochs died in the Jaktorów Forest in Poland.","image":"Copenhagen_Aurochse.jpg.webp","url":"Aurochs"}
