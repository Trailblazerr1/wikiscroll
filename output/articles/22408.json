{"title":"Iran–Iraq War","summary":"The Iran–Iraq War[lower-alpha 3] (Persian: جنگ ایران و عراق‎; Arabic: الحرب الإيرانية العراقية‎) was a protracted armed conflict that began on 22 September 1980 with a full-scale invasion of Iran by neighbouring Iraq. The war lasted for almost eight years, and ended in a stalemate on 20 August 1988, when Iran accepted Resolution 598 of the United Nations Security Council. Iraq's primary rationale for the invasion was to cripple Iran and prevent Ruhollah Khomeini from exporting the 1979 Iranian Revolution movement to Shia-majority Iraq and internally exploit religious tensions that would threaten the Sunni-dominated Ba'athist leadership. Iraq also wished to replace Iran as the dominant state in the Persian Gulf, which, prior to the Iranian Revolution, was not seen as an achievable objective by the Iraqi leadership due to pre-revolutionary Iran's colossal economic and military power as well as its close alliances with the United States, a superpower, and Israel, a major player in the Middle East. The war followed a long-running history of bilateral border disputes between the two states, as a result of which Iraq planned to retake the eastern bank of the Shatt al-Arab ceded in 1975. Iraq supported Arab separatists in the oil-rich territory of Khuzestan seeking an Arab state known as \"Arabistan\" who had started an insurgency in 1979 with support from Iraq. Iraq sought to seize control of and sever Khuzestan from Iran.[71] Saddam Hussein in November 1980 publicly stated that Iraq was not seeking annexation of Khuzestan into Iraq;[72] rather, it is believed that Iraq sought to establish a suzerainty over the territory.[73]","image":"Iran-Iraq_war-gallery.png.webp","url":"Iran–Iraq_War"}
