{"title":"King cake","summary":"A king cake, also known as a three king's cake, is a cake associated in many countries with Epiphany.[1] Its form and ingredients are variable, but in most cases a fève (lit. 'fava bean') such as a figurine, often said to represent the Christ Child, is hidden inside.[2] After the cake is cut, whoever gets the fève wins a prize.[3][2] Modern fèves can be made out of other materials, and can represent various objects and people.[4]","image":"KingCake.jpg.webp"}
