{"title":"Clavicle","summary":"The clavicle, or collarbone, is a slender, S-shaped long bone approximately 6 inches (15Â cm) long[1] that serves as a strut between the shoulder blade and the sternum (breastbone). There are two clavicles, one on the left and one on the right. The clavicle is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally. Together with the shoulder blade, it makes up the shoulder girdle. It is a touchable bone, and in people who have less fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible, as it creates a bulge in the skin. It receives its name from the Latin clavicula (\"little key\"), because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder is abducted. The clavicle is the most commonly fractured bone. It can easily be fractured by impacts to the shoulder from the force of falling on outstretched arms or by a direct hit.[2]","image":"Clavicle_-_anterior_view.png.webp","url":"Clavicle"}
