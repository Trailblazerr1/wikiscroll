A prominent object in the northern winter sky, it is circumpolar to observers north of 44°N. Its name meaning \"little goat\" in Latin, Capella depicted the goat Amalthea that suckled Zeus in classical mythology. Capella is relatively close, at 42.9 light-years (13.2 pc) from the Sun. It is one of the brightest X-ray sources in the sky, thought to come primarily from the corona of Capella Aa.","image":"Auriga_constellation_map.svg.png.webp"}
