{"title":"Taxidermy","summary":"Taxidermy is the art of preserving an animal's body via mounting (over an armature) or stuffing, for the purpose of display or study. Animals are often, but not always, portrayed in a lifelike state. The word taxidermy describes the process of preserving the animal, but the word is also used to describe the end product, which are called taxidermy mounts or referred to simply as \"taxidermy\". The word taxidermy is derived from the Greek words taxis and derma.[1] Taxis means \"arrangement\", and  derma means \"skin\" (the dermis).[1] The word taxidermy translates to \"arrangement of skin\".[1]","image":"Primate_Taxidermy%2C_Rahmat_International_Wildlife_Museum_and_Gallery.jpg.webp"}
