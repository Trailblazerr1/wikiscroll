{"title":"Shale oil extraction","summary":"Shale oil extraction is an industrial process for unconventional oil production.  This process converts kerogen in oil shale into shale oil by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution.  The resultant shale oil is used as fuel oil or upgraded to meet refinery feedstock specifications by adding hydrogen and removing sulfur and nitrogen impurities.","image":"Shell_insitu.gif"}
