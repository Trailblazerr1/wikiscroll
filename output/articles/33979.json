{"title":"Parody","summary":"A parody, also called a spoof, a send-up, a take-off, a lampoon, a play on (something), or a caricature, is a creative work designed to imitate, comment on, and/or make fun of its subject by means of satiric or ironic imitation. Often its subject is an original work or some aspect of it â€” theme/content, author, style, etc. But a parody can also be about a real-life person (e.g. a politician), event, or movement (e.g. the French Revolution or 1960s counterculture). Literary scholar Professor Simon Dentith defines parody as \"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice\".[1] The literary theorist Linda Hutcheon said \"parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\" \nParody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music, theater, television and film, animation, and gaming. Some parody is practiced in theater.","image":"Jan_Brueghel_the_Younger%2C_Satire_on_Tulip_Mania%2C_c._1640.jpg.webp"}
