{"title":"Feline viral rhinotracheitis","summary":"Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by Felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1), of the family Herpesviridae. It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition. Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats,[3] FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide. The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is feline calicivirus.","image":"Red_Pencil_Icon.png.webp"}
