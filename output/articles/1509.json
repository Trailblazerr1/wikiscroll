{"title":"Sex","summary":"Sex is a trait that determines an individual's reproductive function, male or female, in animals and plants that propagate their species through sexual reproduction.[1][2] The type of gametes produced by an organism define its sex. Commonly in plants and animals, male organisms produce smaller gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) while female organisms produce larger gametes (ova, often called egg cells).[3] Organisms that produce both types of gametes are called hermaphrodites.[2][4]  During sexual reproduction, male and female gametes fuse to form zygotes that develop into offspring that inherit a selection of the traits of each parent.","image":"Mice_X_Y_chromosomes.jpg.webp"}
