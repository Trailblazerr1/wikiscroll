{"title":"Epic of King Gesar","summary":"The Epic of King Gesar[lower-alpha 1] (/ˈɡɛzər, ˈɡɛs-/), also spelled Geser (especially in Mongolian contexts) or Kesar (/ˈkɛzər, ˈkɛs-/), is an epic cycle, of Tibet and greater Central Asia, believed to date from the 12th century, that relates the heroic deeds of the culture hero Gesar,[1] the fearless lord of the legendary kingdom of Ling (Wylie: gling). It is recorded variously in poetry and prose, through oral poetry performance, [2] it is sung widely throughout Central Asia and North East of South Asia. Its classic version is to be found in central Tibet.[3] Some 100 bards of this epic (Wylie: sgrung, \"tale\")[4] are still active today in the Gesar belt of China.[5] Tibetan, Mongolian, Buryat, Balti, Ladakhi and Monguor singers maintain the oral tradition and the epic has attracted intense scholarly curiosity as one of the few oral epic traditions to survive as a performing art.  Besides stories conserved by such Chinese minorities as the Bai, Naxi, the Pumi, Lisu, Yugur[6] and Salar,[7] versions of the epic are also recorded among the Balti of Baltistan, the Burusho people of Hunza and Gilgit[6] and the Kalmyk and Ladakhi peoples,[8][9] in Sikkim, Bhutan, Nepal, and among various Tibeto-Burmese, Turkic, and Tungus tribes.[10] The first printed version was a Mongolian text published in Beijing in 1716.[11]","image":"Gesar_Gruschke.jpg.webp"}
