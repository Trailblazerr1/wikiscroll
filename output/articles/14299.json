{"title":"Effective temperature","summary":"The effective temperature of a body such as a star or planet is the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total amount of electromagnetic radiation.[1]  Effective temperature is often used as an estimate of a body's surface temperature when the body's emissivity curve (as a function of wavelength) is not known.","image":"EffectiveTemperature_300dpi_e.png.webp","url":"Effective_temperature"}
