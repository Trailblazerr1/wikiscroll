{"title":"Megalograptus","summary":"Megalograptus is a genus of eurypterid, an extinct group of aquatic arthropods. Fossils of Megalograptus have been recovered in deposits of Katian (Late Ordovician) age in North America. The genus contains five species: M. alveolatus, M. ohioensis, M. shideleri, M. welchi and M. williamsae, all based on fossil material found in the United States. Fossils unassigned to any particular species have also been found in Canada. The generic name translates to \"great writing\" and originates from the mistaken original belief that Megalograptus was a type of graptolite, often given names ending with \"-graptus\" (writing).","image":"Megalograptus_ohioensis%2C_Elkhorn_Formation.jpg.webp"}
