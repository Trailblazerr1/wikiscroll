{"title":"United States Numbered Highway System","summary":"The United States Numbered Highway System (often called U.S. Routes or U.S. Highways) is an integrated network of roads and highways numbered within a nationwide grid in the contiguous United States. As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called Federal Highways, but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by state or local governments since their initial designation in 1926.","image":"US_shield_evolution.svg.png.webp","url":"United_States_Numbered_Highway_System"}
