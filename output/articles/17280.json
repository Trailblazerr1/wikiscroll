{"title":"G protein-coupled receptor","summary":"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), also known as seven-(pass)-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptors, and G protein-linked receptors (GPLR), form a large group of evolutionarily-related proteins that are cell surface receptors that detect molecules outside the cell and activate cellular responses. Coupling with G proteins, they are called seven-transmembrane receptors because they pass through the cell membrane seven times.[2]  Ligands can bind either to extracellular N-terminus and loops (e.g. glutamate  receptors)  or  to  the  binding  site  within  transmembrane  helices  (Rhodopsin-like  family).  They  are  all  activated  by  agonists although a spontaneous auto-activation of an empty receptor can also be observed.[2]","image":"Beta-2-adrenergic-receptor.png.webp"}
