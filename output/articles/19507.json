{"title":"Hammond organ","summary":"The Hammond organ is an electric organ invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert[6] and first manufactured in 1935.[7] Multiple models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to vary sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier to drive a speaker cabinet. The organ is commonly used with the Leslie speaker.","image":"Hammond_c3_Emilio_Mu√±oz.jpg.webp","url":"Hammond_organ"}
