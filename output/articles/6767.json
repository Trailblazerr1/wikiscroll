{"title":"Black-body radiation","summary":"Black-body radiation is the thermal electromagnetic radiation within or surrounding a body in thermodynamic equilibrium with its environment, emitted by a black body (an idealized opaque, non-reflective body). It has a specific spectrum of wavelengths, inversely related to intensity that depend only on the body's temperature, which is assumed for the sake of calculations and theory to be uniform and constant.[1][2][3][4]","image":"PlanckianLocus.png.webp","url":"Black-body_radiation"}
