Historically, they lived in most of present-day northwestern Texas and adjacent areas in eastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, western Oklahoma, and northern Chihuahua. The U.S. government recognizes the Comanche people as the Comanche Nation, headquartered in Lawton, Oklahoma.[1] The Comanche language is a Numic language of the Uto-Aztecan family.  Originally, it was a Shoshoni dialect, but diverged and became a separate language.[3]","image":"Flag_of_the_Comanche_Nation.svg.png.webp","url":"Comanche"}
