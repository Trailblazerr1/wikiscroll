{"title":"Voices of a Distant Star","summary":"Voices of a Distant Star (Japanese: ほしのこえ, Hepburn: Hoshi no Koe, lit. \"Voices of a Star\") is a Japanese science fiction original video animation (OVA) short film created and animated by Makoto Shinkai. It follows the lives of two close childhood friends, a boy and a girl, who get separated once the girl is sent into space to fight in a war against aliens. As the 15-year-old girl goes deeper and deeper into space, the texts she sends take longer to reach the Earth; the film simultaneously follows her battles and the boy's life as he receives her texts over the years.","image":"200517l002-210.jpg.webp","url":"Voices_of_a_Distant_Star"}
