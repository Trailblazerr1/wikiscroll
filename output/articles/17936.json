{"title":"German cruiser Deutschland","summary":"Deutschland was the lead ship of her class of heavy cruisers (often termed pocket battleships) which served with the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany during World War II. Ordered by the Weimar government for the Reichsmarine, she was laid down at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel in February 1929 and completed by April 1933. Originally classified as an armored ship (Panzerschiff) by the Reichsmarine, in February 1940 the Germans reclassified the remaining two ships of this class as heavy cruisers.[lower-alpha 1] In 1940, she was renamed Lützow, after the unfinished  Admiral Hipper-class heavy cruiser Lützow was sold to the Soviet Union the previous year.","image":"German_cruiser_Deutschland_in_1935.jpg.webp"}
