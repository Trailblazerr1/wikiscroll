Sophiatown was a legendary black cultural hub that was destroyed under apartheid, rebuilt under the name of Triomf, and in 2006 officially returned to its original name. Sophiatown was one of the oldest black areas in Johannesburg and its destruction represents some of the excesses of South Africa under apartheid.[2] It produced some of South Africa's most famous writers, musicians, politicians and artists.","image":"SophiatownStreetMap.jpg.webp"}
