{"title":"Foreign policy of the Ronald Reagan administration","summary":"The main goal of the US foreign policy during the presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–1989) was winning the Cold War and the rollback of Communism—which was achieved in the Revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe during 1989; in the German reunification in 1990; and in the Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Historians debate whom to credit, and how much. They agree that victory in the Cold War made the U.S. the world's only superpower, one with good relations with former Communist regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe.[1]","image":"President_Reagan_and_Prime_Minister_Margaret_Thatcher_at_Camp_David_1986.jpg.webp"}
