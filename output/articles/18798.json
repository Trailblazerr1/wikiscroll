{"title":"Great Leap Forward","summary":"The Great Leap Forward (Second Five Year Plan) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) was an economic and social \ncampaign led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1958 to 1962. Chairman Mao Zedong launched the campaign to reconstruct the country from an agrarian economy into a communist society through the formation of people's communes. Mao decreed increased efforts to multiply grain yields and bring industry to the countryside. Local officials were fearful of Anti-Rightist Campaigns and competed to fulfill or over-fulfill quotas based on Mao's exaggerated claims, collecting \"surpluses\" that in fact did not exist and leaving farmers to starve. Higher officials did not dare to report the economic disaster caused by these policies, and national officials, blaming bad weather for the decline in food output, took little or no action. Millions of deaths took place in China during the Great Leap, with estimates ranging between 15 and 55Â million, making the Great Chinese Famine the largest famine in human history.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]","image":"Great_Leap_Forward_(Chinese_characters).svg.png.webp"}
