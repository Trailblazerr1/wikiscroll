{"title":"Pax Mongolica","summary":"The Pax Mongolica (Latin for \"Mongol Peace\"), less often known as Pax Tatarica[1] (\"Tatar Peace\"), is a historiographical term modelled after the original phrase Pax Romana which describes the stabilizing effects of the conquests of the Mongol Empire on the social, cultural and economic life of the inhabitants of the vast Eurasian territory that the Mongols conquered in the 13th and 14th centuries. The term is used to describe the eased communication and commerce the unified administration helped to create and the period of relative peace that followed the Mongols' vast conquests.","image":"Caravane_Marco_Polo.jpg.webp","url":"Pax_Mongolica"}
