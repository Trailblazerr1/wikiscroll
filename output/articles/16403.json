{"title":"Flag of Sweden","summary":"The flag of Sweden (Swedish: Sveriges flagga) consists of a yellow or gold Nordic cross (i.e. a horizontal cross extending to the edges, with the crossbar closer to the hoist than the fly) on a field of light blue. The Nordic cross design traditionally represents Christianity.[2][3] The design and colours of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross patt√©e of gold, and modelled on the Danish flag.[4] Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since Magnus III's royal coat of arms of 1275.","image":"Flag_of_Sweden.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Sweden"}
