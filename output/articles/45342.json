{"title":"Toe loop jump","summary":"The toe loop jump is the simplest jump in the sport of figure skating.  It was invented in the 1920s by American professional figure skater Bruce Mapes.  The toe loop is accomplished with a forward approach on the inside edge of the blade; the skater then switches to a backward-facing position before their takeoff, which is accomplished from the skater's right back outside edge and left toepick. The jump is exited from the back outside edge of the same foot. It is often added to more difficult jumps during combinations, and is the most common second jump performed in combinations. It is also the most commonly attempted jump.","image":"Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp","url":"Toe_loop_jump"}
