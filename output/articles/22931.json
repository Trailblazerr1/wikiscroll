{"title":"James III of Scotland","summary":"James III (10 July 1451/May 1452 â€“ 11 June 1488) was King of Scots from 1460 until his death in battle in 1488. James was an unpopular and ineffective monarch owing to an unwillingness to administer justice fairly, a policy of pursuing alliance with the Kingdom of England, and a disastrous relationship with nearly all his extended family. It was through his marriage to Margaret of Denmark that the Orkney and Shetland islands were added to the territorial possessions of the Scottish crown.","image":"James_III_of_Scotland.jpg.webp"}
