{"title":"Halo (Beyoncé song)","summary":"\"Halo\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Included on the I Am... disc, it was intended to give a behind-the-scenes glimpse of Beyoncé's life, stripped of her make-up and celebrity trappings. Columbia Records released the song, the album's fourth single, to mainstream radio in the United States on January 20, 2009, and to international markets from February 20. Inspired by Ray LaMontagne's 2004 song \"Shelter\", \"Halo\" was written and composed by Beyoncé, Ryan Tedder and Evan Bogart. It was originally conceived by Tedder and Bogart specifically for Beyoncé, although there was media speculation that it had been intended for Leona Lewis.","image":"Beyonce_-_Halo.png.webp","url":"Halo_(Beyoncé_song)"}
