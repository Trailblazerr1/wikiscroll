{"title":"Anattā","summary":"In Buddhism, the term anattā (Pali) or anātman (Sanskrit) refers to the doctrine of \"non-self\" – that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon.[note 1] While often interpreted as a doctrine denying the existence of a self, anatman is more accurately described as a strategy to attain non-attachment by recognizing anything as impermanent, while staying silent on the ultimate existence of an unchanging essence.[1][2][3] In contrast, Hinduism asserts the existence of Atman as pure consciousness or witness-consciousness,[4][5][6][note 2] \"reify[ing] consciousness as an eternal self.\"[7]","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp"}
