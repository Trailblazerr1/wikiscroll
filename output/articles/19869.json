{"title":"Heart rate","summary":"Heart rate is the speed of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions (beats) of the heart per minute (bpm). The heart rate can vary according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide, but is also modulated by a myriad of factors including but not limited to genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness as well as the interaction between and among these factors.[1]  It is usually equal or close to the pulse measured at any peripheral point.","image":"Wiki_Heart_Antomy_Ties_van_Brussel.jpg.webp","url":"Heart_rate"}
