{"title":"Grand jury","summary":"A grand jury is a jury—a group of citizens—empowered by law to conduct legal proceedings, investigate potential criminal conduct, and determine whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may subpoena physical evidence or a person to testify. A grand jury is separate from the courts, which do not preside over its functioning.[1]","image":"Grand_jury_at_Arcadia_Hotel_fire_(LOC).jpg.webp","url":"Grand_jury"}
