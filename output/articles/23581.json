{"title":"John Archibald Wheeler","summary":"John Archibald Wheeler (July 9, 1911 – April 13, 2008) was an American theoretical physicist. He was largely responsible for reviving interest in general relativity in the United States after World War II. Wheeler also worked with Niels Bohr in explaining the basic principles behind nuclear fission. Together with Gregory Breit, Wheeler developed the concept of the Breit–Wheeler process. He is best known for popularizing the term \"black hole,\"[1] as to objects with gravitational collapse already predicted during the early 20th century, for inventing the terms \"quantum foam\", \"neutron moderator\", \"wormhole\" and \"it from bit\", and for hypothesizing the \"one-electron universe\".","image":"John_Archibald_Wheeler_1985.jpg.webp"}
