{"title":"Common dolphin","summary":"The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the most abundant cetacean in the world, with a global population of about six million.[2] Despite this fact and its vernacular name, the common dolphin is not thought of as the archetypal dolphin, with that distinction belonging to the bottlenose dolphin due to its popular appearances in aquaria and the media. However, the common dolphin is often depicted in Ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, most notably in a mural painted by the Greek Minoan civilization.[3]","image":"Common_dolphin_noaa.jpg.webp"}
