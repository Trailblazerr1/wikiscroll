{"title":"Honour thy father and thy mother","summary":"\"Honour thy father and thy mother\" (Hebrew: כַּבֵּד אֶת אָבִיךָ וְאֶת אִמֶּךָ לְמַעַן יַאֲרִכוּן יָמֶיךָ) is one of the Ten Commandments in the Hebrew Bible. The commandment is generally regarded in Protestant and Jewish sources as the fifth in both the list in Exodus 20:1–21, and in Deuteronomy (Dvarim) 5:1–23. Catholics and Lutherans count this as the fourth.[1]","image":"lossy-page1-144px-MCC-31231_Mozes_toont_de_wetstafelen_(1).tif.jpg.webp","url":"Honour_thy_father_and_thy_mother"}
