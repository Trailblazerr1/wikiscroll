{"title":"Hyperinflation","summary":"In economics, hyperinflation is very high and typically accelerating inflation. It quickly erodes the real value of the local currency, as the prices of all goods increase. This causes people to minimize their holdings in that currency as they usually switch to more stable foreign currencies, such as the US dollar.[1] When measured in stable foreign currencies, prices typically remain stable.","image":"HUP_100MB_1946_obverse.jpg.webp","url":"Hyperinflation"}
