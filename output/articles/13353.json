{"title":"Dominican Civil War","summary":"The Dominican Civil War (Spanish: Guerra Civil Dominicana) took place between April 24, 1965, and September 3, 1965, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. It started when civilian and military supporters of the overthrown democratically-elected president Juan Bosch ousted the militarily-installed president Donald Reid Cabral from office. The second coup prompted General Elías Wessin y Wessin to organize elements of the military loyal to President Reid (\"loyalists\"), initiating an armed campaign against the so-called \"constitutionalist\" rebels. In riposte, the dissidents passed out Cristóbal carbines and machine guns to several thousand civilian sympathizers and adherents. Allegations of foreign communist support for the rebels led to a United States intervention in the conflict (codenamed Operation Power Pack),[3] which later transformed into an Organization of American States occupation of the country by the Inter-American Peace Force. Elections were held in 1966, in the aftermath of which Joaquín Balaguer was elected into the presidential seat. Later in the same year, foreign troops departed from the country.","image":"lossy-page1-300px-Humanitarian_G.I.'s._Firefight_where_G.I._pushes_little_kid_under_jeep_for_protection%2C_Santo_Domingo%2C_May_5.%2C_1965_-_NARA_-_541806_(cropped).tif.jpg.webp"}
