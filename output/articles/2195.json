{"title":"Administrative counties of England","summary":"Administrative counties were subnational divisions of England used for local government from 1889 to 1974. They were created by the Local Government Act 1888, which established an elected county council for each area. Some geographically large historic counties were divided into several administrative counties, each with its own county council. The administrative counties operated until 1974, when they were replaced by a system of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties under the Local Government Act 1972.","image":"England_Admin_Counties_1965-1974.png.webp","url":"Administrative_counties_of_England"}
