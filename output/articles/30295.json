{"title":"Molecular orbital","summary":"In chemistry, a molecular orbital is a mathematical function describing the location and wave-like behavior of an electron in a molecule. This function can be used to calculate chemical and physical properties such as the probability of finding an electron in any specific region. The terms atomic orbital and molecular orbital[lower-alpha 1] were introduced by Robert S. Mulliken in 1932 to mean one-electron orbital wave functions.[2]  At an elementary level, they are used to describe the region of space in which a function has a significant amplitude.","image":"Orbitals_acetylene.jpg.webp"}
