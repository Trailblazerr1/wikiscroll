{"title":"Félicette","summary":"Félicette (French pronunciation: ​[fe.liː.sɛt]) was a stray Parisian cat who was the only cat successfully launched into space. She was launched on 18 October 1963 as part of the French space program. Félicette was one of 14 female cats trained for spaceflight. The cats had electrodes implanted onto their skulls so their neurological activity could be monitored throughout the flight. Electrical impulses were applied to the brain and a leg during the flight to stimulate responses. The capsule was recovered 13 minutes after the rocket was ignited. Most of the data from the mission were of good quality, and Félicette survived the flight. A second feline was killed in a launch mishap on 24 October 1963.","image":"Felicette%2C_spacecat.jpg.webp","url":"Félicette"}
