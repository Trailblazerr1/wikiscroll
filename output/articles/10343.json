{"title":"Clovis culture","summary":"The Clovis culture is a prehistoric Paleoamerican culture, named for distinct stone tools found in close association with Pleistocene fauna at Blackwater Locality No. 1 near Clovis, New Mexico, in the 1920s and 1930s. It appears around 11,500â€“11,000 uncalibrated RCYBP[1] at the end of the last glacial period and is characterized by the manufacture of \"Clovis points\" and distinctive bone and ivory tools. Archaeologists' most precise determinations at present suggest this radiocarbon age is equal to roughly 13,200 to 12,900 calendar years ago. Clovis people are considered to be the ancestors of most of the indigenous peoples of the Americas.[2][3][4]","image":"Clovis_Point.jpg.webp"}
