{"title":"Sanssouci","summary":"Sanssouci is a historical building in Potsdam, near Berlin. Built by Prussian King Frederick the Great as his summer palace, it is often counted among the German rivals of Versailles. While Sanssouci is in the more intimate Rococo style and is far smaller than its French Baroque counterpart, it, too, is notable for the numerous temples and follies in the surrounding park. The palace was designed and built by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff between 1745 and 1747 to meet Frederick's need for a private residence where he could escape the pomp and ceremony of the royal court. The palace's name is a French phrase (sans souci) that translates as \"without concerns\", meaning \"without worries\" or \"carefree\", emphasising that the palace was meant as a place of relaxation, rather than a seat of power.","image":"Clouds_Over_Sanssouci_(144056657).jpeg.webp","url":"Sanssouci"}
