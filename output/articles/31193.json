{"title":"Naloxone","summary":"Naloxone, sold under the brand name Narcan among others, is a medication used to block the effects of opioids.[8] It is commonly used to counter decreased breathing in opioid overdose.[8] Naloxone may also be combined with an opioid (in the same pill), to decrease the risk of opioid misuse.[8] Effects begin within two minutes when given intravenously, and within five minutes  when injected into a muscle.[8] Another route it can be given is by spraying it into a person's nose.[9] The effects of naloxone last from about 30 seconds to 24 hours.[10] Multiple doses may be required, as the duration of action of most opioids is greater than that of naloxone.[8]","image":"Naloxone.svg.png.webp","url":"Naloxone"}
