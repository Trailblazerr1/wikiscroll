{"title":"Injunction","summary":"An injunction, which is an integral part of injunctive relief,[1] is a legal instrument in the form of a special court order that compels a party to do or refrain from specific acts.[2] \"When a court employs the extraordinary remedy of injunction, it directs the conduct of a party, and does so with the backing of its full coercive powers.\"[3] A party that refuses or fails to comply with an injunction could face criminal or civil penalties, including possible monetary sanctions and even imprisonment.[4] They can also be charged with contempt of court. Counterinjunctions are injunctions that stop or reverse the enforcement of another injunction.","image":"Court_of_Chancery_edited.jpg.webp","url":"Injunction"}
