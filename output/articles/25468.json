{"title":"Landscape","summary":"A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or man-made features.[1] A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions. Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity.","image":"Cumulus_Clouds_over_Yellow_Prairie2.jpg.webp","url":"Landscape"}
