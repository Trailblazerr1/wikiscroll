{"title":"American Popular Revolutionary Alliance","summary":"The Peruvian Aprista Party (Spanish: Partido Aprista Peruano, PAP) (listen ) is a Peruvian political party and a member of the Socialist International. The party was founded as the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (APRA) by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, who originally intended to create a network of anti-imperialist social and political movements in Latin America. Members are called \"comrades\", based on the fraternity espoused by Haya de la Torre. Originally a centre-left to left-wing party with democratic socialist and nationalist elements (in addition to the aforementioned anti-imperialism), the party moved closer to the political centre under the leadership of Alan García starting in the 1980s, embracing social democracy and later some Third Way policies.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
