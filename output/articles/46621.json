{"title":"Unisphere","summary":"The Unisphere is a spherical stainless steel representation of Earth in Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park in the New York City borough of Queens. The globe was designed by Gilmore D. Clarke as part of his plan for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Commissioned to celebrate the beginning of the space age, the Unisphere was conceived and constructed as the theme symbol of the World's Fair. The theme of the World's Fair was \"Peace Through Understanding\", and the Unisphere represented the theme of global interdependence, being dedicated to \"Man's Achievements on a Shrinking Globe in an Expanding Universe\".","image":"City_Building_and_Unisphere_--_this_morning_(50155048863)_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
