{"title":"My Fair Lady (film)","summary":"My Fair Lady is a 1964 American musical comedy-drama film adapted from the 1956 Lerner and Loewe stage musical based on George Bernard Shaw's 1913 stage play Pygmalion. With a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and directed by George Cukor, the film depicts a poor Cockney flower-seller named Eliza Doolittle who overhears an arrogant phonetics professor, Henry Higgins, as he casually wagers that he could teach her to speak \"proper\" English, thereby making her presentable in the high society of Edwardian London.","image":"My_fair_lady_poster.jpg.webp"}
