{"title":"Novel","summary":"A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, typically written in prose and published as a book. The present English word for a long work of prose fiction derives from the Italian: novella for \"new\", \"news\", or \"short story of something new\", itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning \"new\".[1] Some novelists, including Nathaniel Hawthorne,[2] Herman Melville,[3] Ann Radcliffe,[4] John Cowper Powys,[5] preferred the term \"romance\" to describe their novels.","image":"Liji2_no_bg.png.webp","url":"Novel"}
