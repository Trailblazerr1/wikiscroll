{"title":"Saskatchewan","summary":"Saskatchewan (/səˈskætʃəwən, sæ-, -wɒn/ (listen) sə-SKATCH-ə-wən; Canadian French: [saskatʃəwan]) is a prairie and boreal province in Western Canada, the middle of the three prairie provinces. It is bordered on the west by Alberta, on the north by the Northwest Territories, on the east by Manitoba, to the northeast by Nunavut, and on the south by the U.S. states of Montana and North Dakota. Saskatchewan, along with Alberta make up the only landlocked provinces of Canada. As of Q1 2020, Saskatchewan's population was estimated at 1,181,987.[7] Nearly 10% of Saskatchewan’s total area of 651,900 square kilometres (251,700 sq mi) is fresh water, which is composed mostly of rivers, reservoirs, and the province's 100,000 lakes. The absence of nearby moderating bodies of water render severe winters throughout the province, as a result of Saskatchewan's continental climate. Southern areas have very warm or hot summers.  In winter, temperatures below −45 °C (−49 °F) are possible even in the south during extreme cold snaps.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
