{"title":"Achelousaurus","summary":"Achelousaurus ( /əˌkiːloʊˈsɔːrəs, ˌækɪˌloʊəˈsɔːrəs/[1]) is a genus of centrosaurine ceratopsid dinosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous Period of what is now North America, about 74.2 million years ago. The first fossils of Achelousaurus were collected in Montana in 1987, by a team led by Jack Horner, with more finds made in 1989. In 1994, Achelousaurus horneri was described and named by Scott D. Sampson; the generic name means \"Achelous lizard\", in reference to the Greek deity Achelous, and the specific name refers to Horner. The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults.","image":"Achelousaurus_holotype_(1).jpg.webp"}
