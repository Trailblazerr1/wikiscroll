{"title":"Modern Life Is Rubbish","summary":"Modern Life Is Rubbish is the second album by the English alternative rock band Blur, released in May 1993. Although their debut album Leisure (1991) had been commercially successful, Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release, and fell out of public favour. After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States, poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur's status in the UK.","image":"Blur_-_Modern_Life_is_Rubbish.jpg.webp","url":"Modern_Life_Is_Rubbish"}
