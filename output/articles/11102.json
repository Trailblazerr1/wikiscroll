{"title":"Convex function","summary":"In mathematics, a real-valued function is called convex if the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function does not lie below the graph between the two points. Equivalently, a function is convex if its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. A twice-differentiable function of a single variable is convex if and only if its second derivative is nonnegative on its entire domain.[1] Well-known examples of convex functions of a single variable include the quadratic function \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}}\n  \n and the exponential function \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          e\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e^{x}}\n  \n.   In simple terms, a convex function refers to a function that is in the shape of a cup \n  \n    \n      \n        ∪\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cup }\n  \n, and a concave function is in the shape of a cap \n  \n    \n      \n        ∩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\cap }\n  \n.","image":"cf0bf28fd28f45d07e1ceb909ce333c18c558c93.svg"}
