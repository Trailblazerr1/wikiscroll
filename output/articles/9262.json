{"title":"Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code","summary":"Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) permits reorganization under the bankruptcy laws of the United States. Such reorganization, known as \"Chapter 11 bankruptcy\", is available to every business, whether organized as a corporation, partnership or sole proprietorship, and to individuals, although it is most prominently used by corporate entities.[1] In contrast, Chapter 7 governs the process of a liquidation bankruptcy, though liquidation may also occur under Chapter 11; while Chapter 13 provides a reorganization process for the majority of private individuals.","image":"United_States_Bankruptcy_Court_Seal.png.webp","url":"Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code"}
