{"title":"Social justice","summary":"Social justice is justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society.[1] In Western as well as in older Asian cultures, the concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due from society.[2][3][4] In the current movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets and economic justice.[5][6][7][8][9] Social justice assigns rights and duties in the institutions of society, which enables people to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation. The relevant institutions often include taxation, social insurance, public health, public school, public services, labor law and regulation of markets, to ensure fair distribution of wealth, and equal opportunity.[10]","image":"Sanzio_01_Plato_Aristotle.jpg.webp","url":"Social_justice"}
