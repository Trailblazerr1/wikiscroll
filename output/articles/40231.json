{"title":"Shah Jahan","summary":"Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Khurram[4] (Persian: شهاب‌ الدین محمد خرم‎; 5 January 1592  – 30 January 1666),[6] better known by his regnal name, Shah Jahan (Persian: شاه جهان‎),[7] was the fifth Mughal emperor of India, and reigned from 1628 to 1658.[8] Under his reign, the Mughal Empire reached the peak of its cultural glory.[9] Although an able military commander, Shah Jahan is best remembered for his architectural achievements. His reign ushered in the golden age of Mughal architecture. Shah Jahan commissioned many monuments, the best known of which is the Taj Mahal in Agra, in which is entombed his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. His relationship with Mumtaz Mahal has been heavily adapted into Indian art, literature and cinema. He owned the royal treasury and several precious stones such as the Kohinoor and has thus often been regarded as the wealthiest person in history.","image":"'Jujhar_Singh_Bundela_Kneels_in_Submission_to_Shah_Jahan'%2C_painted_by_Bichitr%2C_c._1630%2C_Chester_Beatty_Library_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
