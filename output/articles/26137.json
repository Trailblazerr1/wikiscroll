{"title":"Light-weight Linux distribution","summary":"A light-weight Linux distribution is one that uses lower memory and/or has less processor-speed requirements than a more \"feature-rich\" Linux distribution. The lower demands on hardware ideally result in a more responsive machine, and/or allow devices with fewer system resources (e.g. older or embedded hardware) to be used productively. The lower memory and/or processor-speed requirements are achieved by avoiding software bloat, i.e. by leaving out features that are perceived to have little or no practical use or advantage, or for which there is no or low demand.","image":"Lubuntu_20.10_2880p_EN_20201231_31_12_2020_18_01_35.png.webp","url":"Light-weight_Linux_distribution"}
