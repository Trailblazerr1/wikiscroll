{"title":"Sex toy","summary":"A sex toy is an object or device that is primarily used to facilitate human sexual pleasure, such as a dildo or vibrator.  Many popular sex toys are designed to resemble human genitals, and may be vibrating or non-vibrating.  The term sex toy can also include BDSM apparatus and sex furniture such as slings; however, it is not applied to items such as birth control, pornography, or condoms. Alternative expressions include adult toy and the dated euphemism marital aid, although \"marital aid\" has a broader sense and is applied to drugs and herbs marketed to supposedly enhance or prolong sex. Sex toys are most commonly sold at a sex shop or online, but they may also be sold in a pharmacy/chemist store, a pornographic store, a head shop, or a department store. Today's sex toys are available in almost all countries for male and females.","image":"Spielzeug_bunt_DSCF7403.jpg.webp"}
