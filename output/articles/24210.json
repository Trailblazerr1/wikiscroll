{"title":"Justin Rose","summary":"Justin Peter Rose, MBE (born 30 July 1980) is an English professional golfer who plays most of his golf on the PGA Tour, while keeping his membership on the European Tour. He won his first major championship at the 2013 U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club, becoming the first English player to win a major since Nick Faldo in 1996 and the first to win the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin in 1970. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Rose won gold at the men's individual tournament. With that victory, Rose joined Hall of Fame members Gary Player, David Graham, Hale Irwin and Bernhard Langer as one of only five golfers to win official tournaments on all six continents on which golf is played. Rose has also twice been runner-up at the Masters Tournament, in 2015 and 2017.","image":"Justin_Rose.jpg.webp"}
