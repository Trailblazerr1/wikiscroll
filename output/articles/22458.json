{"title":"Iron Curtain","summary":"The Iron Curtain was a political boundary dividing Europe into two separate areas from the end of World War II in 1945 until the end of the Cold War in 1991. The term symbolizes the efforts by the Soviet Union (USSR) to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the West and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were NATO members or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain. It later became a term for the 7,000-kilometre-long (4,300Â mi) physical barrier of fences, walls, minefields, and watchtowers that divided the \"east\" and \"west\". The Berlin Wall was also part of this physical barrier.","image":"Iron_Curtain_map.svg.png.webp","url":"Iron_Curtain"}
