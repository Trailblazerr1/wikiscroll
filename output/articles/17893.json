{"title":"Geothermal areas of Yellowstone","summary":"The geothermal areas of Yellowstone include several geyser basins in Yellowstone National Park as well as other geothermal features such as hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles. The number of thermal features in Yellowstone is estimated at 10,000.[1]  A study[2] that was completed in 2011 found that a total of 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone, 465 of which are active during an average year.  These are distributed among nine geyser basins, with a few geysers found in smaller thermal areas throughout the Park.  The number of geysers in each geyser basin are as follows: Upper Geyser Basin (410), Midway Geyser Basin (59), Lower Geyser Basin (283), Norris Geyser Basin (193), West Thumb Geyser Basin (84), Gibbon Geyser Basin (24), Lone Star Geyser Basin (21), Shoshone Geyser Basin (107), Heart Lake Geyser Basin (69), other areas (33).  Although famous large geysers like Old Faithful are part of the total, most of Yellowstone's geysers are small, erupting to only a foot or two.  The hydrothermal system that supplies the geysers with hot water sits within an ancient active caldera.[3]  Many of the thermal features in Yellowstone build up sinter, geyserite, or travertine deposits around and within them.","image":"Steamboat_Geyser_at_Norris_Geyser_Basin_in_Yellowstone-750px.JPG.webp"}
