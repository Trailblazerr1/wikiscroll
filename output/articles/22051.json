{"title":"Instinct","summary":"Instinct is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behaviour, containing both innate (inborn) and learned elements. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a corresponding clearly defined stimulus.","image":"BabyLoggerheadTlalcoyunque3.jpg.webp","url":"Instinct"}
