{"title":"Tobacco smoking","summary":"Tobacco smoking is the practice of burning tobacco and ingesting the smoke that is produced. The smoke may be inhaled, as is done with cigarettes, or simply released from the mouth, as is generally done with pipes and cigars. The practice is believed to have begun as early as 5000â€“3000 BC in Mesoamerica and South America.[1] Tobacco was introduced to Eurasia in the late 17th century by European colonists, where it followed common trade routes. The practice encountered criticism from its first import into the Western world onwards but embedded itself in certain strata of a number of societies before becoming widespread upon the introduction of automated cigarette-rolling apparatus.[2][3]","image":"DunhillEarlyMorningPipeMurrays.jpg.webp","url":"Tobacco_smoking"}
