{"title":"Astrocyte","summary":"Astrocytes (from Ancient Greek ἄστρον, ástron, \"star\" + κύτος, kútos, \"cavity\", \"cell\"), also known collectively as astroglia, are characteristic star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. They perform many functions, including biochemical support of endothelial cells that form the blood–brain barrier,[1] provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, maintenance of extracellular ion balance, regulation of cerebral blood flow, and a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following infection and traumatic injuries.[2] The proportion of astrocytes in the brain is not well defined; depending on the counting technique used, studies have found that the astrocyte proportion varies by region and ranges from 20% to 40% of all glia.[3] Another study reports that astrocytes are the most numerous cell type in the brain.[2] Astrocytes are the major source of cholesterol in the central nervous system.[4] Apolipoprotein E transports cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons and other glial cells, regulating cell signaling in the brain.[5] Astrocytes in humans are more than twenty times larger than in rodent brains, and make contact with more than ten times the number of synapses.[6]","image":"Astrocyte5.jpg.webp","url":"Astrocyte"}
