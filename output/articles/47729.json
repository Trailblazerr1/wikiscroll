{"title":"Volvulus","summary":"A volvulus is when a loop of intestine twists around itself and the mesentery that supports it, resulting in a bowel obstruction.[1] Symptoms include abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, vomiting, constipation, and bloody stool.[1][2] Onset of symptoms may be rapid or more gradual.[2] The mesentery may become so tightly twisted that blood flow to part of the intestine is cut off, resulting in ischemic bowel.[1] In this situation there may be fever or significant pain when the abdomen is touched.[2]","image":"Volvulus.PNG.webp","url":"Volvulus"}
