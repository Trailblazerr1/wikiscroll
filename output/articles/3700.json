{"title":"Anglosphere","summary":"The Anglosphere is a group of English-speaking nations that share common cultural and historical ties to England or the United Kingdom broadly,[1][2] and which today maintain close political, diplomatic and military co-operation. While the nations included in different sources vary, the Anglosphere is usually not considered to include all countries where English is an official language, so it is not synonymous with anglophone, though the nations that are commonly included were all once part of the British Empire.[3]","image":"Commonwealth_and_Anglosphere.svg.png.webp"}
