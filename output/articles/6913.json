{"title":"Blink-182","summary":"Blink-182 is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Their best-known lineup consisted of guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Travis Barker. Though their sound has diversified throughout their career, their musical style blends catchy pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock. Their lyrics center on relationships, adolescent frustration, and maturityâ€”or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, Southern California skate-punk scene and gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent humor.","image":"Blink-182%2C_June_2016.jpg.webp","url":"Blink-182"}
