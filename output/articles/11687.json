{"title":"Culture of South Africa","summary":"South Africa is known for its ethnic and cultural diversity. Amongst black South Africans, a substantial number of rural inhabitants lead largely impoverished lives. Almost all South Africans speak English to some degree of proficiency, in addition to their native language, with English acting as a lingua franca in commerce, education, and government.[1][2] South Africa has eleven official languages, but other indigenous languages are also spoken by smaller groups, chiefly Khoisan languages.[3]","image":"Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png.webp"}
