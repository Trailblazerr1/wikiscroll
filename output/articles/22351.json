{"title":"Invasion of Quebec (1775)","summary":"The Invasion of Quebec (June 1775 – October 1776, French: Invasion du Québec) was the first major military initiative by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War.  The objective of the campaign was to gain military control of the British Province of Quebec (part of modern-day Canada), and convince French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies.  One expedition left Fort Ticonderoga under Richard Montgomery, besieged and captured Fort St. Johns, and very nearly captured British General Guy Carleton when taking Montreal.  The other expedition left Cambridge, Massachusetts, under Benedict Arnold, and traveled with great difficulty through the wilderness of Maine to Quebec City.  The two forces joined there, but they were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in December 1775.","image":"The_Death_of_General_Montgomery_in_the_Attack_on_Quebec_December_31_1775.jpeg.webp","url":"Invasion_of_Quebec_(1775)"}
