{"title":"Animated series","summary":"An animated series is a set of animated works with a common series title, usually related to one another. These episodes should typically share the same main characters, some different secondary characters and a basic theme. Series can have either a finite number of episodes like a miniseries, a definite end, or be open-ended, without a predetermined number of episodes. They can be broadcast on television, shown in movie theatres, released direct-to-video or on the internet. Like animated films, animated series can be of a wide variety of genres and can also have different demographic target audiences, from males to females ranging children to adults.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Animated_series"}
