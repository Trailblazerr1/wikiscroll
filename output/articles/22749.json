{"title":"Jack LaLanne","summary":"Francois Henri \"Jack\" LaLanne (/ləˈleɪn/;[1] 26 September 1914 – 23 January 2011) was an American fitness and nutrition guru and motivational speaker. He described himself as being a \"sugarholic\" and a \"junk food junkie\" until he was age 15. He also had behavioral problems, but \"turned his life around\" after listening to a public lecture about the benefits of good nutrition by health food pioneer Paul Bragg. During his career, he came to believe that the country's overall health depended on the health of its population, and referred to physical culture and nutrition as \"the salvation of America.\"[2]","image":"Jack_LaLanne_1961_portrait.JPG.webp"}
