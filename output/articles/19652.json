{"title":"Harold Innis","summary":"Harold Adams Innis FRSC (November 5, 1894 â€“ November 9, 1952) was a Canadian professor of political economy at the University of Toronto and the author of seminal works on media, communication theory, and Canadian economic history. He helped develop the staples thesis, which holds that Canada's culture, political history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of \"staples\" such as fur, fish, lumber, wheat, mined metals, and coal.  The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada from the 1930s to 1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian political economic tradition.[8]","image":"Harold_Innis_public-domain_library_archives-canada.jpg.webp","url":"Harold_Innis"}
