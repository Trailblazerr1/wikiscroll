{"title":"Heliocentrism","summary":"Heliocentrism[lower-alpha 1] is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Universe. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the third century BC by Aristarchus of Samos,[1] who had been influenced by a concept presented by Philolaus of Croton (c. 470 – 385 BC). In the 5th century BC the Greek Philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas had the thought on different occasions that our earth was spherical and revolving around a \"mystical\" central fire, and that this fire regulated the universe[2]. In medieval Europe, however, Aristarchus' heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic period.[lower-alpha 2]","image":"Heliocentric.jpg.webp"}
