{"title":"Antipyretic","summary":"An antipyretic (/ˌæntipaɪˈrɛtɪk/, from anti- 'against' and pyretic 'feverish') is a substance that reduces fever.[1] Antipyretics cause the hypothalamus to override a prostaglandin-induced increase in temperature. The body then works to lower the temperature, which results in a reduction in fever.","image":"200mg_ibuprofen_tablets.jpg.webp"}
