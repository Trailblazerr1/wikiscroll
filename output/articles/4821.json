{"title":"Atlantic salmon","summary":"The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a species of ray-finned fish in the family Salmonidae. It is the 3rd largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian Taimen and Pacific Chinook Salmon, growing up to a meter in length. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into this ocean. Most populations of this fish species are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adult fish seasonally move upstream again to spawn.[3]","image":"Salmo_salar.jpg.webp","url":"Atlantic_salmon"}
