{"title":"Superacid","summary":"According to the classical definition, a superacid is an acid with an acidity greater than that of 100% pure sulfuric acid,[1] which has a Hammett acidity function (H0) of −12. According to the modern definition, a superacid is a medium in which the chemical potential of the proton is higher than in pure sulfuric acid.[2] Commercially available superacids include trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (CF3SO3H), also known as triflic acid, and fluorosulfuric acid (HSO3F), both of which are about a thousand times stronger (i.e. have more negative H0 values) than sulfuric acid.  Most strong superacids are prepared by the combination of a strong Lewis acid and a strong Brønsted acid. A strong superacid of this kind is fluoroantimonic acid. Another group of superacids, the carborane acid group, contains some of the strongest known acids.  Finally, when treated with anhydrous acid, zeolites (microporous aluminosilicate minerals) will contain superacidic sites within their pores.  These materials are used on massive scale by the petrochemical industry in the upgrading of hydrocarbons to make fuels.","image":"Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png.webp","url":"Superacid"}
