{"title":"Cumulus cloud","summary":"Cumulus clouds are clouds which have flat bases and are often described as \"puffy\", \"cotton-like\" or \"fluffy\" in appearance. Their name derives from the Latin cumulo-, meaning heap or pile.[1] Cumulus clouds are low-level clouds, generally less than 2,000 m (6,600 ft) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus congestus form. Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters.","image":"GoldenMedows.jpg.webp","url":"Cumulus_cloud"}
