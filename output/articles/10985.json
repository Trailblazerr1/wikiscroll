{"title":"Constantius Chlorus","summary":"Flavius Valerius Constantius \"Chlorus\" (c. 250 – 25 July 306), also called Constantius I, was a Roman emperor as one of the four original members of the \"Tetrarchy\" established by Diocletian in 293. He was a junior-ranking emperor, or Caesar, from 293 to 305, and senior emperor, Augustus, from 305 to 306. Constantius was also father of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor of Rome. The nickname Chlorus (Greek: Χλωρός, lit. \"the Green\") was first popularized by Byzantine-era historians and not used during the emperor's lifetime.[2]","image":"Constantius_Chlorus_Ny_Carlsberg_Glyptotek_IN836.jpg.webp","url":"Constantius_Chlorus"}
