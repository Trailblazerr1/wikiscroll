{"title":"Spinster","summary":"Spinster is a term referring to an unmarried woman who is older than what is perceived as the prime age range during which women usually marry. It can also indicate that a woman is considered unlikely to ever marry.[1] The term originally denoted a woman whose occupation was to spin. Reasons for a single woman becoming a spinster or spinner (of wool for instance) varied, often being the result of a young child or adolescent who was orphaned being indentured to an adult; who would then have certain legally defined responsibilities toward the child \"in sickness and in health\" such as feeding and clothing them, providing living quarters, teaching them to read and write, and apprenticing them in a trade such as \"the art and calling of being a spinster\".[2] A synonymous but more pejorative term is old maid.[3] The closest equivalent term for males is \"bachelor\" or \"confirmed bachelor\", but this generally does not carry the same pejorative connotations in reference to age and perceived desirability in marriage.","image":"Oldmaid.gif","url":"Spinster"}
