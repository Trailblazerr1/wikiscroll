{"title":"Poultry","summary":"Poultry (/ˈpoʊltri/) are domesticated birds kept by humans for their eggs, their meat or their feathers.[1] These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails, and turkeys).[2] The term also includes birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \"poultry\" comes from the French/Norman word poule, itself derived from the Latin word pullus, which means small animal.[3]","image":"Poultry_of_the_world.jpg.webp"}
