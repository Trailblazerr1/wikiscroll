{"title":"Elmer Fudd","summary":"Elmer J. Fudd is an animated cartoon character in the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies series and the archenemy of Bugs Bunny. He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon (second only to Bugs himself).[1] His aim is to hunt Bugs, but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters. He speaks in an unusual way, replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws, so he often refers to Bugs Bunny as a \"scwewy\" or \"wascawwy (rascally) wabbit\". Elmer's signature catchphrase is, \"Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits\", as well as his trademark laughter.","image":"ElmerFudd.gif","url":"Elmer_Fudd"}
