{"title":"Helicobacter pylori","summary":"Helicobacter pylori, previously known as Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic, spiral (helical) bacterium usually found in the stomach.[5] Its helical shape (from which the genus name, helicobacter, derives) is thought to have evolved in order to penetrate the mucoid lining of the stomach and thereby establish infection.[7][8] The bacterium was first identified in 1982 by Australian doctors Barry Marshall and Robin Warren.[9][10][11] H.Â pylori has been associated with lymphomas of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, esophagus, colon, rectum, or tissues around the eye (termed extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the cited organ),[12][13] and of lymphoid tissue in the stomach (termed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma).[14]","image":"Immunohistochemical_detection_of_Helicobacter_pylori_histopathology.jpg.webp"}
