{"title":"Population growth","summary":"Population growth is the increase in the number of people in a population. Global human population growth amounts to around 83 million annually,[2] or 1.1% per year. The global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7.9 billion[3] in 2020. The UN projected population to keep growing, and estimates have put the total population at 8.6 billion by mid-2030, 9.8 billion by mid-2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100.[4] However, some academics outside the UN have increasingly developed human population models that account for additional downward pressures on population growth; in such a scenario population would peak before 2100.[5] A popular estimate of sustainable population is 8 billion people.","image":"Absolute_increase_in_global_population_per_year%2C_OWID.svg.png.webp","url":"Population_growth"}
