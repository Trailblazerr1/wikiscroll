{"title":"Natural gas","summary":"Natural gas (also called fossil gas; sometimes just gas) is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting of methane and commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium.[2] Natural gas is colorless and odorless, and explosive, so a sulfur-smell (similar to rotten eggs) is usually added for early detection of leaks.[3] Natural gas is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years.[4] The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.[5] Natural gas is a fossil fuel.","image":"Global_Gas_trade_both_LNG_and_Pipeline.png.webp"}
