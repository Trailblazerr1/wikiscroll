{"title":"Surtsey","summary":"Surtsey (\"Surtr's island\" in Icelandic, Icelandic pronunciation: ​[ˈsʏr̥(t)sˌeiː]) is a volcanic island located in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago off the southern coast of Iceland. At 63.303°N 20.605°W﻿ / 63.303; -20.605, Surtsey is the southernmost point of Iceland.[1] It was formed in a volcanic eruption which began 130 metres (430 feet) below sea level, and reached the surface on 14 November 1963. The eruption lasted until 5 June 1967, when the island reached its maximum size of 2.7 km2 (1.0 sq mi). Since then, wave erosion has caused the island to steadily diminish in size: as of 2012, its surface area was 1.3 km2 (0.50 sq mi).[2] The most recent survey (2007) shows the island's maximum elevation at 155 m (509 ft) above sea level.[3]","image":"Surtsey_eruption_1963.jpg.webp"}
