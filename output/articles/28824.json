{"title":"Mass killings under communist regimes","summary":"Mass killings under communist regimes occurred throughout the 20th century. Death estimates vary widely, depending on the definitions of the deaths that are included in them and the political perspectives of those performing such tallies. Estimates account for executions, deaths from man-made and intentional famines, as well as deaths that have occurred during forced labor, deportations, or imprisonment. 100 million is the most frequently cited number, but the true number cannot be known with certainty and other estimates have been much higher (up to 162 million) or lower (6.7â€“15.5 million).  In addition to mass killings, terms that are used to define such killings include democide, politicide, classicide, genocide, crimes against humanity, holocaust, and repression.","image":"Symbol-hammer-and-sickle.svg.png.webp"}
