{"title":"Ethos","summary":"Ethos (/ˈiːθɒs/ or US: /ˈiːθoʊs/) is a Greek word meaning \"character\" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviors, and even morals.[1] Early Greek stories of Orpheus exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in rhetoric is closely based on the Greek terminology used by Aristotle in his concept of the three artistic proofs or modes of persuasion. It gives credit to the speaker, or the speaker is taking credit.","image":"Australian_Capital_Territory_Legislative_Assembly_and_the_statue_Ethos.jpg.webp","url":"Ethos"}
