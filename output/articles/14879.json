{"title":"Enlil","summary":"Enlil,[lower-alpha 1] later known as Elil, is an ancient Mesopotamian god associated with wind, air, earth, and storms.[4] He is first attested as the chief deity of the Sumerian pantheon,[5] but he was later worshipped by the Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Hurrians. Enlil's primary center of worship was the Ekur temple in the city of Nippur, which was believed to have been built by Enlil himself and was regarded as the \"mooring-rope\" of heaven and earth. He is also sometimes referred to in Sumerian texts as Nunamnir. According to one Sumerian hymn, Enlil himself was so holy that not even the other gods could look upon him. Enlil rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC with the rise of Nippur. His cult fell into decline after Nippur was sacked by the Elamites in 1230 BC and he was eventually supplanted as the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon by the Babylonian national god Marduk. The Babylonian god Bel was a syncretic deity of Enlil’s brother Enki, Enki’s son Marduk, and the shepherd deity Dumuzid.","image":"God_Enlil%2C_seated%2C_from_Nippur%2C_Iraq._1800-1600_BCE._Iraq_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"Enlil"}
