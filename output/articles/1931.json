{"title":"Abortion","summary":"Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus.[note 1] An abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a miscarriage or \"spontaneous abortion\" and occurs in approximately 30% to 40% of pregnancies.[1][2] When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently \"induced miscarriage\". The unmodified word abortion generally refers to an induced abortion.[3][4]","image":"Vacuum-aspiration_(single).svg.png.webp"}
