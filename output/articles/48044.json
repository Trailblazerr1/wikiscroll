{"title":"Waterfall model","summary":"The waterfall model is a breakdown of project activities into linear sequential phases, where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous one and corresponds to a specialization of tasks.[1]  The approach is typical for certain areas of engineering design. In software development,[1] it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction (\"downwards\" like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.","image":"1970_Royce_Managing_the_Development_of_Large_Software_Systems_Fig10.PNG.webp"}
