{"title":"Heaven Upside Down","summary":"Heaven Upside Down is the tenth studio album by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on October 6, 2017 by Loma Vista Recordings and Caroline International. The record had the working title Say10 and was initially due to be issued on Valentine's Day. However, the release was delayed by numerous events, most notably the death of Marilyn Manson's father Hugh Warner, who died during production and to whom the album was later dedicated. The record features many of the same musicians who performed on the band's previous album, The Pale Emperor (2015), including producer Tyler Bates and drummer Gil Sharone. Despite Manson's early implications, long-time bassist Twiggy Ramirez did not participate on the album. He left the group following a sexual assault allegation by a former girlfriend.","image":"Marilyn_Manson_-_Heaven_Upside_Down.png.webp"}
