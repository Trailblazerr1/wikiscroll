{"title":"Yacht","summary":"A yacht /jɒt/ is a sailing or power vessel used for pleasure, cruising, or racing.[2][3][4] There is no standard definition, so the term applies to such vessels that have a cabin with amenities that accommodate overnight use. To be termed a yacht, as opposed to a boat, such a pleasure vessel is likely to be at least 33 feet (10 m) in length and may have been judged to have good aesthetic qualities.[1]","image":"The_Maltese_Falcon_(2906785674).jpg.webp","url":"Yacht"}
