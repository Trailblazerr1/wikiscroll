{"title":"Incel","summary":"An incel (/ˈɪnsɛl/ IN-sel, an abbreviation of \"involuntary celibate\"[1]) is a member of an online subculture of people who define themselves as unable to get a romantic or sexual partner despite desiring one.[2][3][4] Discussions in incel forums are often characterized by resentment and hatred, misogyny, misanthropy, self-pity and self-loathing, racism, a sense of entitlement to sex, and the endorsement of violence against women and sexually active people.[16] The American nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) described the subculture as \"part of the online male supremacist ecosystem\" that is included in their list of hate groups.[17][18] Incels are mostly male and heterosexual,[12][14][19] and many sources report that incels are predominantly white.[20][21][22] Estimates of the overall size of the subculture vary greatly, ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of members.[23][24]","image":"Isla_Vista_Killings_Memorial_Service.JPG.webp"}
