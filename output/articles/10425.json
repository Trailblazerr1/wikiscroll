{"title":"Codeine","summary":"Codeine is an opiate and prodrug of morphine used to treat pain, coughing, and diarrhea. It is found naturally in the sap of the opium poppy, Papaver somniferum.[4][5] It is typically used to treat mild to moderate degrees of pain.[4] Greater benefit may occur when combined with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as aspirin or ibuprofen.[4] Evidence does not support its use for acute cough suppression in children or adults.[6][7] In Europe, it is not recommended as a cough medicine in those under 12 years of age.[4] It is generally taken by mouth.[4] It typically starts working after half an hour, with maximum effect at two hours.[4] Its effects last for about four to six hours. Codeine exhibits similar abuse potential as other opioid medications. [4]","image":"Codein_-_Codeine.svg.png.webp","url":"Codeine"}
