{"title":"Merkabah mysticism","summary":"Merkabah or Merkavah (Hebrew: מרכבה‎) mysticism (lit. Chariot mysticism) is a school of early Jewish mysticism, c. 100 BCE – 1000 CE, centered on visions such as those found in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 1, or in the heikhalot (\"palaces\") literature, concerning stories of ascents to the heavenly palaces and the Throne of God. The main corpus of the Merkabah literature was composed in the period 200–700 CE, although later references to the Chariot tradition can also be found in the literature of the Chassidei Ashkenaz in the Middle Ages.[1] A major text in this tradition is the Maaseh Merkavah (\"Works of the Chariot\").[2]","image":"Ezekiel's_vision.jpg.webp"}
