{"title":"Jeconiah","summary":"Jeconiah (Hebrew: יְכָנְיָה‎ Yəḵonəyā [jəxɔnjaː], meaning \"Yah has established\";[2] Greek: Ιεχονιας; Latin: Iechonias, Jechonias), also known as Coniah[3] and as Jehoiachin (Hebrew: יְהוֹיָכִין‎ Yəhōyāḵīn [jəhoːjaːˈxiːn]; Latin: Ioachin, Joachin), was the nineteenth and penultimate king of Judah who was dethroned by the King of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE and was taken into captivity. He was the son and successor of King Jehoiakim, and the grandson of King Josiah. Most of what is known about Jeconiah is found in the Hebrew Bible. Records of Jeconiah's existence have been found in Iraq, such as the Jehoiachin's Rations Tablets. These tablets were excavated near the Ishtar Gate in Babylon and have been dated to c. 592 BCE. Written in cuneiform, they mention Jeconiah (Akkadian: 𒅀𒀪𒌑𒆠𒉡, Yaʾúkinu [ia-ʾ-ú-ki-nu]) and his five sons as recipients of food rations in Babylon.[4]","image":"Jehoiachin-Jeconiah.png.webp"}
