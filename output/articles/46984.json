{"title":"Uzi","summary":"The Uzi ( /ˈuːzi/ (listen); Hebrew: עוזי‎, romanized: Ūżi; officially cased as UZI) is a family of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns first designed by Major Uziel \"Uzi\" Gal in the late 1940s, shortly after the establishment of the State of Israel. It is one of the first weapons to incorporate a telescoping bolt design, which allows the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon.","image":"Uzi-nobg.png.webp","url":"Uzi"}
