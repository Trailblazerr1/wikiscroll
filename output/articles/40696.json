{"title":"Silo","summary":"A silo (from the Greek σιρός – siros, \"pit for holding grain\") is a structure for storing bulk materials.  Silos are used in agriculture to store grain (see grain elevators) or fermented feed known as silage.  Silos are commonly used for bulk storage of grain, coal, cement, carbon black, woodchips, food products and sawdust. Three types of silos are in widespread use today: tower silos, bunker silos, and bag silos.","image":"Ralls_Texas_Grain_Silos_2010.jpg.webp"}
