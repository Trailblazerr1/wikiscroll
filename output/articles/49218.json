{"title":"Yes and no","summary":"Yes and no, or word pairs with similar words, are expressions of the affirmative and the negative, respectively, in several languages, including English. Some languages make a distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions; thus they may have three-form or four-form systems instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including Early Middle English but Modern English has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in many facets of communication, such as: eye blink communication, head movements, Morse Code, and sign language.  Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
