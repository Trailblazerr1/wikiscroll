{"title":"History of the Romani people","summary":"The Romani people, also referred to depending on the sub-group as Roma, Sinti or Sindhi, or Kale are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group, who live primarily in Europe. They originated in northwest regions of India[1][2][3] and left sometime between the 6th and 11th century to work in Middle Eastern courts of their own volition, or as slaves. A small number of nomadic groups were cut off from their return to the subcontinent by conflicts and moved west,[1] eventually settling in Europe, the Byzantine Empire and North Africa via Iran.[4]","image":"Flag_of_the_Romani_people.svg.png.webp","url":"History_of_the_Romani_people"}
