{"title":"Deimatic behaviour","summary":"Deimatic behaviour or startle display[1] means any pattern of bluffing behaviour in an animal that lacks strong defences, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape.[2][3] The term deimatic or dymantic originates from the Greek δειματόω (deimatόo), meaning \"to frighten\".[4][5]","image":"Spirama_helicina-W-Thailand7810.JPG.webp","url":"Deimatic_behaviour"}
