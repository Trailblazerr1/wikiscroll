{"title":"Sulfonylurea","summary":"Sulfonylureas (UK: sulphonylurea) are a class of organic compounds used in medicine and agriculture, for example as antidiabetic drugs widely used in the management of diabetes mellitus type 2. They act by increasing insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas.[1] A number of sulfonylureas are also used as herbicides, because they can interfere with plant biosynthesis of certain amino acids.[2] Sulfonylureas are also used experimentally to inhibit interleukin 1 beta release from the NALP3 (or NLRP3) inflammasome.[3]","image":"Sulfonylurea_group.svg.png.webp","url":"Sulfonylurea"}
