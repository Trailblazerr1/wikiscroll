{"title":"Dye-sensitized solar cell","summary":"A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC, DSC, DYSC[1] or Grätzel cell) is a low-cost solar cell belonging to the group of thin film solar cells.[2] It is based on a semiconductor formed between a photo-sensitized anode and an electrolyte, a photoelectrochemical system. The modern version of a dye solar cell, also known as the Grätzel cell, was originally co-invented in 1988 by Brian O'Regan and Michael Grätzel at UC Berkeley[3] and this work was later developed by the aforementioned scientists at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) until the publication of the first high efficiency DSSC in 1991.[4] Michael Grätzel has been awarded the 2010 Millennium Technology Prize for this invention.[5]","image":"Dye.sensitized.solar.cells.jpg.webp","url":"Dye-sensitized_solar_cell"}
