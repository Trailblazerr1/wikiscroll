{"title":"Changshan","summary":"A changshan (Chinese: 長衫; pinyin: chángshān; lit. 'long shirt'; [ʈʂʰǎŋʂán] (listen)) is a traditional Manchu dress (or robe, long jacket or tunic) worn by men. In function, it is considered the male equivalent of the women's cheongsam (qipao). It is also known as a changpao (chángpáo 長袍, \"long robe\") or dagua (大褂, dàguà, \"great jacket\"). It was often worn by men with a magua or \"riding jacket\". These types of dress were widely adopted beginning under the Manchu (Chinese: 滿族) rulers of the Qing dynasty (Chinese: 清朝), who required that men in certain positions wear this style.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
