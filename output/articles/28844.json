{"title":"Mast cell","summary":"A mast cell (also known as a mastocyte or a labrocyte[1]) is a resident cell of connective tissue that contains many granules rich in histamine and heparin. Specifically, it is a type of granulocyte derived from the myeloid stem cell that is a part of the immune and neuroimmune systems. Mast cells were discovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1877.[2] Although best known for their role in allergy and anaphylaxis, mast cells play an important protective role as well, being intimately involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, immune tolerance, defense against pathogens, and vascular permeability in brain tumours.[3][4]","image":"SMCpolyhydroxysmall.jpg.webp"}
