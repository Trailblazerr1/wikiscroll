{"title":"Pandora","summary":"In Greek mythology, Pandora (Greek: Πανδώρα,  derived from πᾶν, pān, i.e. \"all\" and δῶρον, dōron, i.e. \"gift\", thus  \"the all-endowed\", \"all-gifted\" or \"all-giving\")[1] was the first human woman created by Hephaestus on the instructions of Zeus.[2][3] As Hesiod related it, each god cooperated by giving her unique gifts. Her other name—inscribed against her figure on a white-ground kylix in the British Museum[4]—is Anesidora (Ancient Greek: Ἀνησιδώρα), \"she who sends up gifts\"[5] (up implying \"from below\" within the earth).","image":"Pandora_-_John_William_Waterhouse.jpg.webp"}
