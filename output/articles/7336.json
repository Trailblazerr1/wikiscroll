{"title":"Bouncer (doorman)","summary":"A bouncer (also known as a doorman or door supervisor)[1] is a type of security guard, employed at venues such as bars, nightclubs, cabaret clubs, stripclubs, casinos, hotels, billiard halls, restaurants, sporting events, or concerts. A bouncer's duties are to provide security, to check legal age and drinking age, to refuse entry for intoxicated persons, and to deal with aggressive behavior or non-compliance with statutory or establishment rules. \nThey are civilians and they are often hired directly by the venue, rather than by a security firm. Bouncers are often required where crowd size, clientele or alcohol consumption may make arguments or fights a possibility, or where the threat or presence of criminal gang activity or violence is high. At some clubs, bouncers are also responsible for \"face control\", choosing who is allowed to patronize the establishment. In the United States, civil liability and court costs related to the use of force by bouncers are \"the highest preventable loss found within the [bar] industry\", as many United States bouncers are often taken to court and other countries have similar problems of excessive force. In many countries, federal or state governments have taken steps to professionalise the industry by requiring bouncers to have training, licensing, and a criminal records background check.","image":"Modern_Bouncers.jpg.webp"}
