{"title":"Symmetric multiprocessing","summary":"Symmetric multiprocessing or shared-memory multiprocessing[1] (SMP) involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.","image":"SMP_-_Symmetric_Multiprocessor_System.svg.png.webp","url":"Symmetric_multiprocessing"}
