{"title":"Strip club","summary":"A strip club is a venue where strippers provide adult entertainment, predominantly in the form of striptease or other erotic or exotic dances. Strip clubs typically adopt a nightclub or bar style, and can also adopt a theatre or cabaret-style. American-style strip clubs began to appear outside North America after World War II, arriving in Asia in the late 1980s and Europe in 1978,[1] where they competed against the local English and French styles of striptease and erotic performances.","image":"Kultfabrik_New_York_Tabledance_Limousine.jpg.webp","url":"Strip_club"}
