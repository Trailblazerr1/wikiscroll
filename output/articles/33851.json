{"title":"Paradise","summary":"In religion, paradise is a place of exceptional happiness and delight.[1] Paradisiacal notions are often laden with pastoral imagery, and may be cosmogonical or eschatological or both, often compared to the miseries of human civilization: in paradise there is only peace, prosperity, and happiness. Paradise is a place of contentment, a land of luxury and fulfillment. Paradise is often described as a \"higher place\", the holiest place, in contrast to this world, or underworlds such as Hell.","image":"Jan_Bruegel_d._Ã„._003.jpg.webp","url":"Paradise"}
