{"title":"Small interfering RNA","summary":"Small interfering RNA (siRNA), sometimes known as short interfering RNA or silencing RNA, is a class of double-stranded RNA non-coding RNA molecules, typically 20-24 base pairs in length, similar to miRNA, and operating within the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway.  It interferes with the expression of specific genes with complementary nucleotide sequences by degrading mRNA after transcription, preventing translation.[1]","image":"SiRNAvitro.gif","url":"Small_interfering_RNA"}
