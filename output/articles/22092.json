{"title":"Integrity","summary":"Integrity is the practice of being honest and showing a consistent and uncompromising adherence to strong moral and ethical principles and values.[1][2][3]\nIn ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Integrity can stand in opposition to hypocrisy,[4] in that judging with the standards of integrity involves regarding internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding within themselves apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs. The word integrity evolved from the Latin adjective integer, meaning whole or complete.[1] In this context, integrity is the inner sense of \"wholeness\" deriving from qualities such as honesty and consistency of character.[5] As such, one may judge that others \"have integrity\" to the extent that they act according to the values, beliefs and principles they claim to hold.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
