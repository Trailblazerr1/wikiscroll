{"title":"Solidarity (Polish trade union)","summary":"Solidarity (Polish: Solidarność, pronounced [sɔliˈdarnɔɕt͡ɕ] (listen)), full name Independent Self-Governing Trade Union \"Solidarity\"[4] (Niezależny Samorządny Związek Zawodowy \"Solidarność\" [ɲɛzaˈlɛʐnɨ samɔˈʐɔndnɨ ˈzvjɔ̃zɛɡ zavɔˈdɔvɨ sɔliˈdarnɔɕt͡ɕ]), is a trade union founded in August 1980 at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Poland.[1] Subsequently, it was the first independent trade union in a Warsaw Pact country to be recognised by the state.[5] The union's membership peaked at 10 million in September 1981,[2][3] representing one-third of the country's working-age population.[6] Solidarity's leader Lech Wałęsa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and the union is widely recognised as having played a central role in the end of Communist rule in Poland.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
