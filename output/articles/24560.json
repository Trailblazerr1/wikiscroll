{"title":"Kelp forest","summary":"Kelp forests are underwater areas with a high density of kelp, which covers a large part of the world's coastlines. They are recognized as one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on Earth.[1]   Smaller areas of anchored kelp are called kelp beds. Kelp forests occur worldwide throughout temperate and polar coastal oceans.[1] In 2007, kelp forests were also discovered in tropical waters near Ecuador.[2] In context, algal kelp forest combined with coral reefs account for less than 1% of global primary productivity.[3]","image":"Kelp_forest_distribution_map.png.webp","url":"Kelp_forest"}
