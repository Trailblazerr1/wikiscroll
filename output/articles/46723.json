{"title":"United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance","summary":"Force Reconnaissance (FORECON) is one of the United States Marine Corps' special operations capable forces (SOC) which supplies military intelligence to the command element of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF), supporting task force commanders and subordinate units of the Fleet Marine Force (FMF). Historically, Force Recon was the premier Marine Corps special operations unit, performing deep reconnaissance and direct action operations for USSOCOM, though most of those missions were lost to the Marine Raider Regiment during a reorganization of Marine special operations in 2006.[2]","image":"US_Marine_Corps_Force_Reconnaissance_Insignia.svg.png.webp","url":"United_States_Marine_Corps_Force_Reconnaissance"}
