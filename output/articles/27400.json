{"title":"Lost Generation","summary":"The Lost Generation was the social generational cohort that was in early adulthood during World War I. \"Lost\" in this context refers to the \"disoriented, wandering, directionless\" spirit of many of the war's survivors in the early postwar period.[1] The term is also particularly used to refer to a group of American expatriate writers living in Paris during the 1920s.[2][3][4] Gertrude Stein is credited with coining the term, and it was subsequently popularized by Ernest Hemingway who used it in the epigraph for his 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises: \"You are all a lost generation\".[5][6]","image":"Generation_timeline.svg.png.webp"}
