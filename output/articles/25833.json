{"title":"Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic","summary":"The legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic were political institutions in the ancient Roman Republic.  According to the contemporary historian Polybius, it was the people (and thus the assemblies) who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of Roman laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Under the Constitution of the Roman Republic, the people (and thus the assemblies) held the ultimate source of sovereignty.","image":"Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png.webp","url":"Legislative_assemblies_of_the_Roman_Republic"}
