{"title":"Kami","summary":"Kami (Japanese: 神, [kaꜜmi])  (often taken to mean \"gods\", though the concept is more involved than that) are the spirits, phenomena or \"holy powers\" that are venerated in the religion of Shinto. They can be elements of the landscape, forces of nature, as well as beings and the qualities that these beings express; they can also be the spirits of venerated dead people. Many kami are considered the ancient ancestors of entire clans (some ancestors became kami upon their death if they were able to embody the values and virtues of kami in life). Traditionally, great or sensational leaders like the Emperor could be or became kami.[1]","image":"Shinto_torii_vermillion.svg.png.webp"}
