{"title":"Cytoskeleton","summary":"The cytoskeleton is a complex, dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments present in the cytoplasm of all cells, excluding bacteria and archaea.[1] It extends from the cell nucleus to the cell membrane and is composed of similar proteins in the various organisms. In eukaryotes, it is composed of three main components, microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules, and these are all capable of rapid growth or disassembly dependent on the cell's requirements.[2]","image":"Animal_Cell.svg.png.webp"}
