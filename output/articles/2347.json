{"title":"Afrikaans","summary":"Afrikaans (UK: /ˌæfrɪˈkɑːns/, US: /ˌɑːf-/, English meaning: African)[4][5] is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia, and, to a lesser extent, Botswana, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It evolved from the Dutch vernacular[6][7] of Holland (Hollandic dialect)[8][9] spoken by the European (Dutch, French, and German) settlers and their slaves in South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century.[10] It is considered by most linguists to be partially, rather than fully, a creole language.[11] Afrikaans linguistics researchers maintain that Afrikaans, originally being a peasant language, is only partially creole.[12]","image":"Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png.webp"}
