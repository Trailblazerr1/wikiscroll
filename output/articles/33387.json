{"title":"Osmosis","summary":"Osmosis (/ɒzˈmoʊsɪs/, US also /ɒs-/)[1] is the spontaneous net movement or diffusion of solvent molecules through a selectively permeable membrane from a region of high water potential (region of lower solute concentration) to a region of low water potential (region of higher solute concentration),[2] in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides.[3][4][5] It may also be used to describe a physical process in which any solvent moves across a selectively permeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations.[6][7] Osmosis can be made to do work.[8] Osmotic pressure is defined as the external pressure required to be applied so that there is no net movement of solvent across the membrane.  Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.","image":"0307_Osmosis.jpg.webp","url":"Osmosis"}
