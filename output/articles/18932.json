It is the only species in the genus Chelonia.[4] Its range extends throughout tropical and subtropical seas around the world, with two distinct populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, but it is also found in the Indian Ocean.[5][6] The common name refers to the usually green fat found beneath its carapace, not to the color of its carapace, which is olive to black.","image":"Green_turtle_swimming_over_coral_reefs_in_Kona.jpg.webp"}
