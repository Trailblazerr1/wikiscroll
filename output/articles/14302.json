Different plants of the genus Cannabis contain different and often unpredictable concentrations of THC and other cannabinoids and hundreds of other molecules that have a pharmacological effect,[2][3] so that the final net effect cannot reliably be foreseen.","image":"Marijuana-Cannabis-Weed-Bud-Gram.jpg.webp","url":"Effects_of_cannabis"}
