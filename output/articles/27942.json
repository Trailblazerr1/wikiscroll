{"title":"Madonna (Madonna album)","summary":"Madonna (retitled Madonna: The First Album for the 1985 reissue) is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Madonna, released on July 27, 1983, by Sire Records. After having established herself as a singer in downtown New York City, Madonna was signed by Sire president Seymour Stein, due to the club success of her debut single, \"Everybody\" (1982). She became the sole writer for most of the album's tracks, and chose Reggie Lucas as its primary producer. Unhappy with Lucas's production outputs, she invited John \"Jellybean\" Benitez to complete the album, who remixed three tracks and produced \"Holiday\".","image":"Madonna%2C_debut_album_cover.png.webp","url":"Madonna_(Madonna_album)"}
