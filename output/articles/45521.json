{"title":"Top quark","summary":"The top quark, sometimes also referred to as the truth quark, (symbol: t) is the most massive of all observed elementary particles. It derives its mass from its coupling to the Higgs Boson. This coupling y t {\\displaystyle y_{t}} is very close to unity; in the Standard Model of particle physics, it is the largest (strongest) coupling at the scale of the weak interactions and above. The top quark was discovered in 1995 by the CDF[2] and DÃ˜[3] experiments at Fermilab.","image":"0fe9554452b93508c9d2479414a45981ecc75a2d.svg","url":"Top_quark"}
