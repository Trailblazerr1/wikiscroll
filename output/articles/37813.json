It is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly fewer than 1.1 million residents as of 2020,[9] but it is the second-most densely populated behind New Jersey. The state takes its name from the eponymous island, though most of its land area is on the mainland. Rhode Island borders Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; it also shares a small maritime border with New York.[10] Providence is the state capital and most populous city.","image":"Flag_of_Rhode_Island.svg.png.webp","url":"Rhode_Island"}
