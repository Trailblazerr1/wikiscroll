{"title":"Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape","summary":"The Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape occurred on 31 October 1973 when three Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteers escaped from Mountjoy Prison in Dublin, Ireland, aboard a hijacked Alouette II helicopter, which briefly landed in the prison's exercise yard. The escape made headlines around the world and was an embarrassment to the Irish coalition government of the time, led by Fine Gael's Liam Cosgrave, which was criticised by opposition party Fianna Fáil. A manhunt involving twenty thousand members of the Irish Defence Forces and Garda Síochána was launched for the escapees, one of whom, Seamus Twomey, was not recaptured until December 1977. The Wolfe Tones wrote a song celebrating the escape called \"The Helicopter Song\", which topped the Irish popular music charts.","image":"Aerospatiale_Alouette_II_Private_F-GIJA%2C_LFJY_Chambley%2C_France_PP1248602145.jpg.webp","url":"Mountjoy_Prison_helicopter_escape"}
