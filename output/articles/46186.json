{"title":"Turks in Germany","summary":"Turks in Germany, also referred to as German Turks and Turkish Germans (German: Türken in Deutschland/Deutsch-Türken; Turkish: Almanya'da yaşayan Türkler/Almanya Türkleri), are ethnic Turkish people living in Germany. These terms are also used to refer to German-born individuals who are of full or partial Turkish ancestry. Whilst the majority of Turks arrived or originate from Turkey, there are also significant ethnic Turkish communities living in Germany who come from (or descend from) Southeastern Europe (i.e. Balkan Turks from Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia, Serbia and Romania), the island of Cyprus (i.e. Turkish Cypriots from both the Republic of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus),[17] as well as Turkish communities from other parts of the Levant (including Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria). At present, ethnic Turkish people form the largest ethnic minority in Germany.[18] They also form the largest Turkish population in the Turkish diaspora.","image":"Turkisch-day-in-Berlin.jpg.webp"}
