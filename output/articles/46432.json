{"title":"USS Maine (1889)","summary":"Maine was a United States Navy ship that sank in Havana Harbor on February 15, 1898, contributing to the outbreak of the Spanishâ€“American War in April. American newspapers, engaging in yellow journalism to boost circulation, claimed that the Spanish were responsible for the ship's destruction. The phrase, \"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\" became a rallying cry for action. Although the Maine explosion was not a direct cause, it served as a catalyst that accelerated the events leading up to the war.","image":"USS_Maine_(ACR-1)_starboard_bow_view%2C_1898_(26510673494).jpg.webp"}
