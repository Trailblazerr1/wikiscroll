{"title":"Naraka (Buddhism)","summary":"Naraka (Sanskrit: नरक; Pali: निरय Niraya) is a term in Buddhist cosmology[1] usually referred to in English as \"hell\" (or \"hell realm\") or \"purgatory\". The Narakas of Buddhism are closely related to diyu, the hell in Chinese mythology. A Naraka differs from the hell of Christianity in two respects: firstly, beings are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment or punishment; and secondly, the length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal,[2] though it is usually incomprehensibly long, from hundreds of millions to sextillions (1021) of years.","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp","url":"Naraka_(Buddhism)"}
