{"title":"Second law of thermodynamics","summary":"The second law of thermodynamics establishes the concept of entropy as a physical property of a thermodynamic system. Entropy predicts the direction of spontaneous processes, and determines whether they are irreversible or impossible despite obeying the requirement of conservation of energy as expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. The second law may be formulated by the observation that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest. If all processes in the system are reversible, the entropy is constant.[1] An increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, often referred to in the concept of the arrow of time.[2]","image":"Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Second_law_of_thermodynamics"}
