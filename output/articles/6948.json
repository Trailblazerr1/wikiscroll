{"title":"Blood on the Dance Floor (song)","summary":"\"Blood on the Dance Floor\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Michael Jackson. The song was released as the first single from the remix album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix. Jackson and Teddy Riley created the track in time for the 1991 release of Dangerous. However, it did not appear on that record and was worked on further for its commercial release in 1997. One interpretation of the song describes a predatory woman named Susie who seduces Jackson before plotting to stab him with a knife. The composition explores a variety of genres ranging from funk to new jack swing.","image":"MJ-BOTDF_Single.jpg.webp","url":"Blood_on_the_Dance_Floor_(song)"}
