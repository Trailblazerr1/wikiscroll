{"title":"Nationalization","summary":"Nationalization (or nationalisation) is the process of transforming privately-owned assets into public assets by bringing them under the public ownership of a national government or  state.[1] Nationalization usually refers to private assets or to assets owned by lower levels of government (such as  municipalities) being transferred to the state. Nationalization contrasts with privatization and with demutualization. When previously nationalized assets are privatized and subsequently returned to public ownership at a later stage, they are said to have undergone renationalization. Industries often subject to nationalization include the commanding heights of the economy -  telecommunications,  electric power, fossil fuels,  railways, airlines, iron ore,  media,  postal services, banks, and water - though, in many jurisdictions, many such entities have no history of private ownership.","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Nationalization"}
