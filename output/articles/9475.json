{"title":"Chemical thermodynamics","summary":"Chemical thermodynamics is the study of the interrelation of heat and work with chemical reactions or with physical changes of state within the confines of the laws of thermodynamics. Chemical thermodynamics involves not only laboratory measurements of various thermodynamic properties, but also the application of mathematical methods to the study of chemical questions and the spontaneity of processes.","image":"Willard_Gibbs.jpg.webp","url":"Chemical_thermodynamics"}
