{"title":"Enclosure","summary":"Enclosure or Inclosure[lower-alpha 1] is a term, used in English landownership, that refers to the appropriation of \"waste[lower-alpha 2]\" or \"common land[lower-alpha 3]\"  enclosing it and by doing so depriving commoners of their ancient rights of access and privilege. Agreements to enclose land could be either through a \"formal\" or \"informal\" process.[3] The process could normally be accomplished in  three ways. First there was the creation of \"closes[lower-alpha 4]\", taken out of larger common fields by their owners.[lower-alpha 5] Secondly, there was enclosure by proprietors, owners who acted together, usually small farmers or squires, leading to the enclosure of whole parishes. Finally there were enclosures by Acts of Parliament.[5]","image":"Reeve_and_Serfs.jpg.webp","url":"Enclosure"}
