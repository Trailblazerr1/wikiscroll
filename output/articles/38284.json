{"title":"Rocket","summary":"A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit.â€‰'bobbin/spool')[nb 1][1] is a spacecraft, aircraft, vehicle or projectile that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket.[2] Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space.","image":"Soyuz_TMA-9_launch.jpg.webp"}
