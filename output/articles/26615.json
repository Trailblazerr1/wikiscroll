{"title":"List of Seinfeld episodes","summary":"Seinfeld is an American television sitcom created by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David. Seinfeld has been described by some as a \"show about nothing\",[1] similar to the self-parodying \"show within a show\" of fourth-season episode \"The Pilot\". Jerry Seinfeld is the lead character and played as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment block on New York City's Upper West Side, the show features a host of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, which include George Costanza, Elaine Benes, and Cosmo Kramer, who are portrayed by Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards, respectively.[2]","image":"Seinfeld_logo.svg.png.webp"}
