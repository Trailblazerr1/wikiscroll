{"title":"Led Zeppelin discography","summary":"The discography of the English rock band Led Zeppelin consists of eight studio albums, four live albums, nine compilation albums, sixteen singles and eight music downloads. Formed in London in 1968, the group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band pioneered the concept of album-oriented rock and often refused to release popular songs as singles.[1] Their debut album, Led Zeppelin (1969), released by Atlantic Records, charted at number six on the UK Albums Chart and at number ten on the United States Billboard 200. It received several sales certifications, including an eight-times multi-platinum from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Diamond from the Music Canada. Led Zeppelin's second studio album, Led Zeppelin II, recorded when the band were on tour, was released a few months after the first. It reached number one in several countries, including the UK and the US, where it was certified 12 times multi-platinum. The album produced Led Zeppelin's highest-charting single, \"Whole Lotta Love\", which peaked at several music charts in the top 10. Led Zeppelin III (1970) was a softer, more folk-based effort compared to the hard rock of the band's previous releases.[2] It also peaked at number one in the UK and in the US.","image":"Jimmy_Page_with_Robert_Plant_2_-_Led_Zeppelin_-_1977.jpg.webp"}
