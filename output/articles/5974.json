{"title":"Battles of Saratoga","summary":"The Battles of Saratoga (September 19 and October 7, 1777) marked the climax of the Saratoga campaign, giving a decisive victory to the Americans over the British in the American Revolutionary War.  British General John Burgoyne led a large invasion army southward from Canada in the Champlain Valley, hoping to meet a similar British force marching northward from New York City and another British force marching eastward from Lake Ontario; the goal was to take Albany, New York. The southern and western forces never arrived, and Burgoyne was surrounded by American forces in upstate New York 15 miles short of his goal. He fought two battles which took place 18 days apart on the same ground, 9 miles (14Â km) south of Saratoga, New York. They both failed.","image":"Surrender_of_General_Burgoyne.jpg.webp","url":"Battles_of_Saratoga"}
