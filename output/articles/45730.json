{"title":"Tram","summary":"A tram (in North America streetcar or trolley) is a train that runs on tramway track on public urban streets; some include segments of segregated right-of-way.[1][2] The lines or networks operated by tramcars as public transport are called tramways or simply tram/streetcar. Many recently built tramways use the contemporary term light rail. The vehicles are called streetcars or trolleys (not meaning trolleybus) in North America and trams or tramcars elsewhere. The first two terms are often used interchangeably in the United States, with trolley being preferred in the eastern US and streetcar in Canada and the western US. In parts of the United States, internally powered buses made to resemble a streetcar are often referred to as \"trolleys\". To avoid further confusion with trolley buses, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) refers to them as \"trolley-replica buses\". In the United States, the term tram has sometimes been used for rubber-tired trackless trains, which are unrelated to other kinds of trams.","image":"Aiga_railtransportation_25.svg.png.webp","url":"Tram"}
