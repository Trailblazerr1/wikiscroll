{"title":"Milton Friedman","summary":"Milton Friedman (/ˈfriːdmən/ (listen); July 31, 1912 – November 16, 2006) was an American economist and statistician who received the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his research on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and the complexity of stabilization policy.[2] With George Stigler and others, Friedman was among the intellectual leaders of the Chicago school of economics, a neoclassical school of economic thought associated with the work of the faculty at the University of Chicago that rejected Keynesianism in favor of monetarism until the mid-1970s, when it turned to new classical macroeconomics heavily based on the concept of rational expectations.[3] Several students, young professors and academics who were recruited or mentored by Friedman at Chicago went on to become leading economists, including Gary Becker,[4] Robert Fogel,[5] Thomas Sowell[6] and Robert Lucas Jr.[7]","image":"Portrait_of_Milton_Friedman.jpg.webp","url":"Milton_Friedman"}
