{"title":"Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990","summary":"The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 or ADA (42 U.S.C. § 12101) is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964,[1] which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal, and later sexual orientation. In addition, unlike the Civil Rights  Act, the ADA also requires covered employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees with disabilities, and imposes accessibility requirements on public accommodations.[2]","image":"Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg.png.webp","url":"A%2fAmericans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990"}
