{"title":"Artpop","summary":"Artpop is the third studio album by American singer Lady Gaga. It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and Interscope Records. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, Born This Way. Work continued until 2013 while Gaga was traveling for her Born This Way Ball tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described Artpop as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse Warholian\" phenomenon in pop culture. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way.","image":"Artpop_cover.png.webp"}
