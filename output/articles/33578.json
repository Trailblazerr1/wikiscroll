{"title":"PC game","summary":"A personal computer game, also known as a PC game or computer game, is a type of video game played on a personal computer (PC) rather than a video game console or arcade machine. Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater capacity in input, processing, video and audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, and now its lack of physical media, make precisely assessing its size difficult.[1] In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.[2]","image":"WPVG_icon_2016.svg.png.webp"}
