{"title":"Funeral","summary":"A funeral is a ceremony connected with the final disposition of a corpse, such as a burial or cremation, with the attendant observances.[1] Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honor. Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. Funerals have both normative and legal components. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation.","image":"Opening_of_the_mouth_ceremony_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
