{"title":"Gene expression","summary":"Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product that enables it to produce end products, protein or non-coding RNA, and ultimately affect a phenotype, as the final effect. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein-coding genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snRNA), the product is a functional non-coding RNA. Gene expression is summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology first formulated by Francis Crick in 1958,[1] further developed in his 1970 article,[2] and expanded by the subsequent discoveries of reverse transcription[3][4][5] and RNA replication.[6]","image":"Extended_Central_Dogma_with_Enzymes.jpg.webp","url":"Gene_expression"}
