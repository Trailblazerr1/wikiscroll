{"title":"Supremacy Clause","summary":"The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution of the United States (Article VI, Clause 2), establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the \"supreme Law of the Land\", and thus take priority over any conflicting state laws.[1] It provides that state courts are bound by, and state constitutions subordinate to, the supreme law.[2] However, federal statutes and treaties are supreme only if they do not contravene the Constitution.","image":"Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Supremacy_Clause"}
