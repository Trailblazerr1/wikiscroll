It is the novel counterpart of the Theodore Sturgeon Award for best short story, awarded by the same organization.[1] The award is named in honor of John W. Campbell (1910â€“71), whose science fiction writing and role as editor of Analog Science Fiction and Fact made him one of the most influential editors in the early history of science fiction.[2] The award was established in 1973 by writers and critics Harry Harrison and Brian Aldiss \"as a way of continuing his efforts to encourage writers to produce their best possible work.\"[1] Locus magazine has listed it as one of the \"major awards\" of written science fiction.[3]","image":"Campbell_Memorial_Award_trophies.jpg.webp"}
