{"title":"United States customary units","summary":"United States customary units form a system of measurement units commonly used in the United States and U.S. territories since being formalized in 1832.[1] The United States customary system (USCS or USC) developed from English units which were in use in the British Empire before the U.S. became an independent country. The United Kingdom's system of measures was overhauled in 1824 to create the imperial system, which was officially adopted in 1826, changing the definitions of some of its units. Subsequently, while many U.S. units are essentially similar to their imperial counterparts, there are significant differences between the systems.","image":"Metric_and_imperial_systems_(2019).svg.png.webp"}
