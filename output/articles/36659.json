{"title":"Qin (state)","summary":"Qin (Chinese: 秦; pinyin: Qín) was an ancient Chinese state during the Zhou dynasty. Traditionally dated to 897 BC,[2] it took its origin in a reconquest of western lands previously lost to the Rong; its position at the western edge of Chinese civilization permitted expansion and development that was unavailable to its rivals in the North China Plain. Following extensive \"Legalist\" reform in the 3rd century BC, Qin emerged as one of the dominant powers of the Seven Warring States and unified the seven states of China in 221 BC under Qin Shi Huang. The Qin dynasty it established was short-lived but greatly influenced later Chinese history.","image":"EN-QIN260BCE.jpg.webp","url":"Qin_(state)"}
