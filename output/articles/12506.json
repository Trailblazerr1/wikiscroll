{"title":"Delicacy","summary":"A delicacy is usually a rare or expensive food item that is considered highly desirable, sophisticated or peculiarly distinctive, within a given culture. Irrespective of local preferences, such a label is typically pervasive throughout a region. Often this is because of unusual flavors or characteristics or because it is rare or expensive compared to standard staple foods.","image":"Tuber_brumale_-_Vue_sur_la_tranche_coup√©e.jpg.webp"}
