{"title":"Rhizome","summary":"In botany and dendrology, a rhizome (/ˈraɪzoʊm/, from Ancient Greek: rhízōma (ῥίζωμα) – \"mass of roots\",[1] from rhizóō (ῥιζόω) \"cause to strike root\")[2] is a modified subterranean plant stem that sends out roots and shoots from its nodes. Rhizomes are also called creeping rootstalks or just rootstalks.[3] Rhizomes develop from axillary buds and grow horizontally. The rhizome also retains the ability to allow new shoots to grow upwards.[4]","image":"Euphorbia_rhizophora2_ies.jpg.webp","url":"Rhizome"}
