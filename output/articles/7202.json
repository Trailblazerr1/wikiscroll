{"title":"Boogie-woogie","summary":"Boogie-woogie is a genre of blues music that became popular during the late 1920s, developed in African-American communities in the 1870s.[1] It was eventually extended from piano, to piano duo and trio, guitar, big band, country and western music, and gospel. While standard blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing[2] and Boogie-woogie dance.","image":"\"Texarkana_and_Northern\"_Boogie-woogie_bassline.svg.png.webp"}
