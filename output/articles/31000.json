{"title":"My War","summary":"My War is the second studio album by American band Black Flag.  It polarized fans on its release in 1984 on SST Records over the LP's B-side, on which the band slowed down to a heavy, Black Sabbath-esque trudge, despite the reputation the band had earned as leaders in fast hardcore punk on its first album, Damaged (1981).","image":"Black_Flag_-_My_War_cover.jpg.webp"}
