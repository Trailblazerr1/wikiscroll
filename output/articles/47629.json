{"title":"Vitamin K","summary":"Vitamin K refers to structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamers found in foods and marketed as dietary supplements.[1] The human body requires vitamin K for post-synthesis modification of certain proteins that are required for blood coagulation (K from koagulation, Danish for \"coagulation\") or for controlling binding of calcium in bones and other tissues.[2] The complete synthesis involves final modification of these so-called \"Gla proteins\" by the enzyme gamma-glutamyl carboxylase that uses vitamin K as a cofactor.","image":"Vitamin_K_structures.svg.png.webp","url":"Vitamin_K"}
