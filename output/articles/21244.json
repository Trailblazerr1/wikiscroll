{"title":"Hydrogen cyanide","summary":"Hydrogen cyanide, sometimes called prussic acid, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous, and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 °C (78.1 °F). HCN is produced on an industrial scale and is a highly valued precursor to many chemical compounds ranging from polymers to pharmaceuticals.  Large-scale applications are for the production of potassium cyanide and adiponitrile, used in mining and plastics, respectively.[8]","image":"Hydrogen-cyanide-2D.svg.png.webp"}
