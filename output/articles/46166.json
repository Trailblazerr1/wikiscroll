{"title":"Turing machine","summary":"A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine[1] that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.[2] Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.[3]","image":"Automata_theory.svg.png.webp","url":"Turing_machine"}
