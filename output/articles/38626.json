{"title":"Royal Maundy","summary":"Royal Maundy /ˈmɔːndi/ is a religious service in the Church of England held on Maundy Thursday, the day before Good Friday. At the service, the British monarch or a royal official ceremonially distributes small silver coins known as \"Maundy money\" (legally, \"the Queen's Maundy money\") as symbolic alms to elderly recipients. The coins are technically legal tender, but typically do not circulate due to their silver content and low numismatic value. A small sum of ordinary money is also given in lieu of gifts of clothing and food that the sovereign once bestowed on Maundy recipients.","image":"Royal_Maundy_1867.jpg.webp"}
