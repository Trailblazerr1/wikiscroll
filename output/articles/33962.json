{"title":"Parliament of Australia","summary":"The Parliament of Australia (officially the Federal Parliament,[1] also called the Commonwealth Parliament) is the legislative branch of the government of Australia. It consists of three elements: the Crown (represented by the Governor-General), the Senate and the House of Representatives.[1][2] The combination of two elected chambers, in which the members of the Senate represent the states and territories while the members of the House represent electoral divisions according to population, is modelled on the United States Congress. Through both chambers, however, there is a fused executive, drawn from the Westminster system.[3]","image":"Coat_of_Arms_of_Australia.svg.png.webp"}
