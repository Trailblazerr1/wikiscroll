{"title":"Instruction pipelining","summary":"In computer science, instruction pipelining is a technique for implementing instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. Pipelining attempts to keep every part of the processor busy with some instruction by dividing incoming instructions into a series of sequential steps (the eponymous \"pipeline\") performed by different processor units with different parts of instructions processed in parallel.","image":"Pipeline%2C_4_stage.svg.png.webp"}
