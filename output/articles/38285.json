{"title":"Rocket Lab Electron","summary":"Electron is a two-stage, partially recoverable orbital launch vehicle developed by Rocket Lab, an American aerospace company with a wholly owned New Zealand subsidiary.[14][15] Electron was developed to service the commercial small satellite launch market.[16] Its Rutherford engines are the first electric-pump-fed engine to power an orbital-class rocket.[17] Electron is often flown with a kickstage or Rocket Lab's Photon spacecraft. Although the rocket is designed to be expendable, Rocket Lab has recovered the first stage twice and is working towards the capability of reusing the booster.[18]","image":"Electron_rocket_logo.svg.png.webp"}
