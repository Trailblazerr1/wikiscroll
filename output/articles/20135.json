{"title":"Heraklonas","summary":"Constantine Heraclius (Greek: Κωνσταντῖνος Ἡράκλειος, romanized: Kōnstantînos Hērákleios; 626–641), commonly known by the diminutive Heraklonas or Herakleonas (Greek: Ἡρακλ[ε]ωνᾶς), and more rarely as Heraclius II,[2] was the son of Heraclius and his niece Martina. His father had stipulated in his will that both of his sons, Heraklonas and Constantine III, should rule jointly upon his death. Heraclius also specified that his wife, Martina, was to be called \"Mother and Empress\" insofar as she might have influence at court as well.[3] The emperor Heraclius died in February 641 from edema. When Martina did make the late Emperor's will public she faced staunch resistance to her playing any active role in government, but both Heraklonas and Constantine were proclaimed joint-emperors in February 641 without incident. After Constantine died of tuberculosis in April/May 641, Heraklonas became sole emperor, under the regency of his mother due to his young age.  He reigned from April/May – September/October 641, when he was overthrown by Valentinus, a general and usurper of Armenian extract, who installed Constans II, the son of Constantine III. Valentinus had Heraklonas' nose cut off, then exiled him to Rhodes, where he is believed to have died in the same year.","image":"Solidus_of_Heraclonas.png.webp"}
