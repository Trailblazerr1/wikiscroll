{"title":"Charlie Parker","summary":"Charles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 â€“ March 12, 1955), nicknamed \"Bird\" and \"Yardbird\", was an American jazz saxophonist, band leader and composer.[1] Parker was a highly influential soloist and leading figure in the development of bebop,[2] a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique, and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso and introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas into jazz, including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. Primarily a player of the alto saxophone, Parker's tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. He was known for the very clear, sweet and articulate note he could produce from the saxophone.","image":"Portrait_of_Charlie_Parker_in_1947.jpg.webp"}
