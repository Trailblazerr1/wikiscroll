{"title":"List of Veronica Mars episodes","summary":"Veronica Mars is an American television series created by Rob Thomas. The series ran for three seasons; it premiered on September 22, 2004, during UPN's last two years, and ended on May 22, 2007, after a season on UPN's successor, The CW.[1] The series balances murder mystery, high school and college drama, featuring social commentary with sarcasm and off-beat humor in a style often compared to film noir.[2] Set in the fictional town of Neptune, Veronica Mars starred Kristen Bell as the title character, a student who progressed from high school to college during the series while moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. Episodes have a distinct structure: Veronica solves a different \"case of the week\" while continually trying to solve a season-long mystery.[3] The first two seasons of the series have a season-long mystery arc, in which the conflict is introduced in the first episode of the season and resolved in the finale.[4] The third season takes on a different format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that last the course of several episodes.[5]","image":"Veronica_Mars_2004_logo.svg.png.webp"}
