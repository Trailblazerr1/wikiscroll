{"title":"Carotene","summary":"The term carotene (also carotin, from the Latin carota, \"carrot\"[1][2]) is used for many related unsaturated hydrocarbon substances having the formula C40Hx, which are synthesized by plants but in general cannot be made by animals (with the exception of some aphids and spider mites which acquired the synthesizing genes from fungi).[3] Carotenes are photosynthetic pigments important for photosynthesis. Carotenes contain no oxygen atoms. They absorb ultraviolet, violet, and blue light and scatter orange or red light, and (in low concentrations) yellow light.","image":"BetaCarotene-3d.png.webp","url":"Carotene"}
