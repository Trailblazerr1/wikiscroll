{"title":"Taylor series","summary":"In mathematics, the Taylor series of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor's series are named after Brook Taylor,  who introduced them in 1715.","image":"Sintay_SVG.svg.png.webp","url":"Taylor_series"}
