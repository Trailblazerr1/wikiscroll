{"title":"Feline immunodeficiency virus","summary":"Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a Lentivirus that affects cats worldwide, with 2.5% to 4.4%[1][2]  of felines being infected. FIV differs taxonomically from two other feline retroviruses, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline foamy virus (FFV), and is more closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Within FIV, five subtypes have been identified based on nucleotide sequence differences coding for the viral envelope (env) or polymerase (pol). FIV is the only non-primate lentivirus to cause an AIDS-like syndrome, but FIV is not typically fatal for cats, as they can live relatively healthily as carriers and transmitters of the disease for many years. A vaccine is available, although its efficacy remains uncertain. Cats will test positive for FIV antibodies after vaccination.[3]","image":"PDB_4fiv_EBI.jpg.webp","url":"Feline_immunodeficiency_virus"}
