{"title":"Contemporary architecture","summary":"Contemporary architecture is the architecture of the 21st century.  No single style is dominant.[1]  Contemporary architects work in several different styles, from postmodernism, high-tech architecture and new interpretations of traditional architecture[2][3] to highly conceptual forms and designs, resembling sculpture on an enormous scale. Some of these styles and approaches make use of very advanced technology and modern building materials, such as tube structures which allow construction of buildings that are taller, lighter and stronger than those in the 20th century, while others prioritize the use of natural and ecological materials like stone, wood and lime.[4] One technology that is common to all forms of contemporary architecture is the use of new techniques of computer-aided design, which allow buildings to be designed and modeled on computers in three dimensions, and constructed with more precision and speed.","image":"Hard_Rock_Hotel_Singapore.jpg.webp","url":"Contemporary_architecture"}
