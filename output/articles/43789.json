{"title":"Tet Offensive","summary":"The Tet Offensive  (Vietnamese: Sự kiện Tết Mậu Thân 1968, lit. \"Tet offensive of 1968\", also Tổng tiến công và nổi dậy, Tết Mậu Thân 1968, \"General offensive and uprising of Tet Mau Than\")[13] was a major escalation and one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War. It was launched on January 30, 1968 by forces of the Viet Cong (VC) and North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) against the forces of the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), the United States Armed Forces and their allies. It was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian command and control centers throughout South Vietnam.[14] The name is the truncated version of the Lunar New Year festival name in Vietnamese, Tết Nguyên Đán, with the offense chosen during a holiday period as most ARVN personnel were on leave.[15] The purpose of the wide-scale offensive by the Hanoi Politburo was to trigger political instability, in a belief that mass armed assault on urban centers would trigger defections and rebellions.","image":"Tet_Offensive_map.png.webp"}
