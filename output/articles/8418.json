{"title":"Cannabis indica","summary":"Cannabis indica is an annual plant in the family Cannabaceae.[1] It is a putative species of the genus Cannabis.  Whether it and Cannabis sativa are truly separate species is a matter of debate. The Cannabis indica plant is cultivated for many purposes; for example, the plant fibers can be converted into cloth. Cannabis indica produces large amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).[2] The higher concentrations of THC provide euphoric effects making it popular for use both as a recreational, alternative medicine, and a clinical research drug.[3]","image":"Row(Purple_Kush).jpg.webp","url":"Cannabis_indica"}
