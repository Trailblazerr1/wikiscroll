{"title":"Luddite","summary":"The Luddites were a secret oath-based organisation[1] of English textile workers in the 19th century, a radical faction which destroyed textile machinery. The group are believed to have taken their name from Ned Ludd, a weaver from Anstey, near Leicester. They protested against manufacturers who used machines in what they called \"a fraudulent and deceitful manner\" to get around standard labour practices.[2] Luddites feared that the time spent learning the skills of their craft would go to waste, as machines would replace their role in the industry.[3]","image":"Luddite.jpg.webp","url":"Luddite"}
