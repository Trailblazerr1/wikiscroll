{"title":"Communications satellite","summary":"A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth. Communications satellites are used for television, telephone, radio, internet, and military applications.[1] As of 1 January 2021, there are 2,224 communications satellites in Earth orbit.[2]  Most communications satellites are in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles (35,900Â km) above the equator, so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky; therefore the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track the satellite.","image":"AEHF_1.jpg.webp","url":"Communications_satellite"}
