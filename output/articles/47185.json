{"title":"Vauxhall Bridge","summary":"Vauxhall Bridge is a Grade II* listed steel and granite deck arch bridge in central London. It crosses the River Thames in a southeastâ€“northwest direction between Vauxhall on the south bank and Pimlico on the north bank. Opened in 1906, it replaced an earlier bridge, originally known as Regent Bridge but later renamed Vauxhall Bridge, built between 1809 and 1816 as part of a scheme for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was built on the site of a former ferry.","image":"Vauxhall_Bridge_London_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1752640.jpg.webp","url":"Vauxhall_Bridge"}
