{"title":"Muʿtazila","summary":"Muʿtazila (Arabic: المعتزلة‎ al-muʿtazilah, English: “Those Who Withdraw, or Stand Apart”), also called Ahl al-ʿAdl wa al-Tawḥīd, is an Islamic group that appeared in early Islāmic history in the dispute over Alī's leadership of the Muslim community after the death of the third caliph, Uthman. Those who would neither condemn nor sanction ʿAlī or his opponents but took a middle position between him and his opponents at the battle of Siffin and the battle of Jamal were termed the Muʿtazila.[1] By the 10th century CE the term had also come to refer to an Islamic school of speculative theology (kalām) that flourished in Basra and Baghdad (8th–10th century).[2][3][4]","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp","url":"Muʿtazila"}
