{"title":"Ifrit","summary":"Ifrit, also spelled as efreet, afrit, and afreet (Arabic: ʻIfrīt: عفريت, pl ʻAfārīt: عفاريت), is a powerful type of Angel in Islamic mythology. The afarit are often associated with the underworld and also identified with the spirits of the dead, and have been compared to evil geniī loci in European culture.[2] In Quran, hadith and Mi'raj narrations the term is always followed by the phrase among the jinn. In later folklore, they developed into independent entities, identified as powerful demons or spirits of the dead who sometimes inhabit desolate places such as ruins and temples. Their true habitat is the underworld.[3]","image":"Brooklyn_Museum_-_Arghan_Div_Brings_the_Chest_of_Armor_to_Hamza.jpg.webp","url":"Ifrit"}
