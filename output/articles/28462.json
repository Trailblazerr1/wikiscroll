{"title":"Marginal cost","summary":"In economics,  the marginal cost is the change in the total cost that arises when the quantity produced is incremented, the cost of producing additional quantity.[1] In some contexts, it refers to an increment of one unit of output, and in others it refers to the rate of change of total cost as output is increased by an infinitesimal amount. As Figure 1 shows, the marginal cost is measured in dollars per unit, whereas total cost is in dollars, and the marginal cost is the slope of the total cost, the rate at which it increases with output. Marginal cost is different from average cost, which is the total cost divided by the number of units produced.","image":"Marginal_cost1a.png.webp"}
