{"title":"Vitamin A","summary":"Vitamin A is a group of unsaturated nutritional organic compounds that includes retinol, retinal, and several provitamin A carotenoids (most notably beta-carotene).[1][2][3] Vitamin A has multiple functions: it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system, and for good vision.[4][5] Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin, the light-absorbing molecule[6] necessary for both low-light (scotopic vision) and color vision.[7]","image":"Vitamin-A-Synthese.png.webp"}
