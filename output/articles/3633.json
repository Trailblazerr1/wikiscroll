{"title":"Andy Kaufman","summary":"Andrew Geoffrey Kaufman (/ˈkaʊfmən/;[1] January 17, 1949 – May 16, 1984[2]) was an American actor, singer, amateur wrestler and performance artist. While often called a comedian, Kaufman preferred to describe himself instead as a \"song and dance man\". He has sometimes been called an \"anti-comedian\".[3] He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in an interview, \"I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. The comedian's promise is that he will go out there and make you laugh with him. My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can.\"[4]","image":"Akaufman1.jpg.webp"}
