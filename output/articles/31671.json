The length of the neotropical otter can range from 36–66 centimetres (14–26 in), plus a tail of 37–84 centimetres (15–33 in). Body weight ranges from 5–15 kilograms (11–33 lb).[2] Otters are members of the family Mustelidae, the most species-rich (and therefore diverse) family in the order Carnivora.","image":"Lontra_longicaudis_4.jpeg.webp","url":"Neotropical_otter"}
