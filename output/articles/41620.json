{"title":"Spanish orthography","summary":"Spanish orthography is the orthography used in the Spanish language. The alphabet uses the Latin script. The spelling is fairly phonemic, especially in comparison to more opaque orthographies like English, having a relatively consistent mapping of graphemes to phonemes; in other words, the pronunciation of a given Spanish-language word can largely be predicted from its spelling and to a slightly lesser extent vice versa. Notable features of Spanish punctuation include the lack of the serial comma and the use of inverted question and exclamation marks: ⟨¿⟩ ⟨¡⟩.","image":"Cantar_de_mio_Cid_f74r.jpg.webp"}
