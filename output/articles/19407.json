{"title":"Haitian Revolution","summary":"The Haitian Revolution (French: révolution haïtienne French pronunciation: ​[ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ a.i.sjɛn]; Haitian Creole: revolisyon ayisyen) was a successful insurrection by self-liberated slaves against French colonial rule in Saint-Domingue, now the sovereign state of Haiti. The revolt began on 22 August 1791,[3] and ended in 1804 with the former colony's independence. It involved black, biracial, French, Spanish, British, and Polish participants—with the ex-slave Toussaint Louverture emerging as Haiti's most charismatic hero. The revolution was the only slave uprising that led to the founding of a state which was both free from slavery (though not from forced labour[4]) and ruled by non-whites and former captives.[5] It is now widely seen as a defining moment in the history of the Atlantic World.[6][7]","image":"Haitian_Revolution.png.webp","url":"Haitian_Revolution"}
