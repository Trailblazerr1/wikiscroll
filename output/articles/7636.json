{"title":"British Overseas Territories","summary":"The British Overseas Territories (BOTs), also known as United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs), are fourteen territories all with a constitutional and historical link with the United Kingdom.[1][2] They are the last remnants of the former British Empire and do not form part of the United Kingdom itself. Some of the permanently inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. Three of the territories are inhabited only by a transitory population of military or scientific personnel.  All but one of the rest are listed by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization as non-self-governing territories. They all have the British monarch as head of state.[3]","image":"Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png.webp"}
