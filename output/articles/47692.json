{"title":"Volapük","summary":"Volapük (/ˈvɒləpʊk/ in English;[2] [volaˈpyk] in Volapük) is a constructed language created between 1879 and 1880 by Johann Martin Schleyer, a Roman Catholic priest in Baden, Germany, who believed that God had told him in a dream to create an international language. Volapük conventions took place in 1884 (Friedrichshafen), 1887 (Munich) and 1889 (Paris). The first two conventions used German, and the last conference used only Volapük. In 1889, there were an estimated 283 clubs, 25 periodicals in or about Volapük, and 316 textbooks in 25 languages;[3] at that time the language claimed nearly a million adherents.[4] Volapük was largely displaced between late 19th and early 20th century by Esperanto.[5]","image":"Volapuk_symbol.svg.png.webp","url":"Volapük"}
