{"title":"Red River Trails","summary":"The Red River Trails were a network of ox cart routes connecting the Red River Colony (the \"Selkirk Settlement\") and Fort Garry in British North America with the head of navigation on the Mississippi River in the United States. These trade routes ran from the location of present-day Winnipeg in the Canadian province of Manitoba across the Canada–United States border, and thence by a variety of routes through what is now the eastern part of North Dakota and western and central Minnesota to Mendota and Saint Paul, Minnesota on the Mississippi.","image":"Métis_and_Red_River_carts.jpg.webp"}
