{"title":"Bill Ponsford","summary":"William Harold Ponsford MBE (19 October 1900 – 6 April 1991) was an Australian cricketer.  Usually playing as an opening batsman, he formed a successful and long-lived partnership opening the batting for Victoria and Australia with Bill Woodfull, his friend and state and national captain. Ponsford is the only player to twice break the world record for the highest individual score in first-class cricket; Ponsford and Brian Lara are the only cricketers to twice score 400 runs in an innings. Ponsford holds the Australian record for a partnership in Test cricket, set in 1934 in combination with Don Bradman (451 for 2nd wicket)—the man who broke many of Ponsford's other individual records. In fact, he along with Bradman set the record for the highest partnership ever for any wicket in Test cricket history when playing on away soil (451 runs for the second wicket)[2]","image":"Studio_Portrait_of_William_Ponsford%2C_ca._1925.jpg.webp","url":"Bill_Ponsford"}
