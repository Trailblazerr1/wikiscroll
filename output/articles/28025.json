{"title":"Magnox","summary":"Magnox is a type of nuclear power/production reactor that was designed to run on natural uranium with graphite as the moderator and carbon dioxide gas as the heat exchange coolant. It belongs to the wider class of gas-cooled reactors. The name comes from the magnesium-aluminium alloy used  to clad the fuel rods inside the reactor. Like most other \"Generation I nuclear reactors\", the Magnox was designed with the dual purpose of producing electrical power and plutonium-239 for the nascent nuclear weapons program in Britain. The name refers specifically to the United Kingdom design but is sometimes used generically to refer to any similar reactor.","image":"Magnox_reactor_schematic.svg.png.webp","url":"Magnox"}
