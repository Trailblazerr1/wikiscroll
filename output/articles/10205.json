{"title":"Classified advertising","summary":"Classified advertising is a form of advertising, particularly common in newspapers, online and other periodicals, which may be sold or distributed free of charge. Classified advertisements are much cheaper than larger display advertisements used by businesses,[1] although display advertising is more widespread.[2] They were also commonly called \"want\" ads, starting in 1763,[3] and are sometimes called small ads in Britain.[4]","image":"For_Sale_-_Classifieds.jpg.webp","url":"Classified_advertising"}
