{"title":"Entrez","summary":"The Entrez (pronounced ɒnˈtreɪ[1]) Global Query Cross-Database Search System is a federated search engine, or web portal that allows users to search many discrete health sciences databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website.[2] The NCBI is a part of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), which is itself a department of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which in turn is a part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The name \"Entrez\" (a greeting meaning \"Come in\" in French) was chosen to reflect the spirit of welcoming the public to search the content available from the NLM.","image":"Entrez.svg.png.webp"}
