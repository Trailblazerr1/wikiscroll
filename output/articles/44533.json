{"title":"The Replacements (band)","summary":"The Replacements were an American rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1979. Initially a punk rock band, they are one of the main pioneers of alternative rock. The band was composed of the guitarist and vocalist Paul Westerberg, guitarist Bob Stinson, bass guitarist Tommy Stinson and drummer Chris Mars for most of its existence. Following several acclaimed albums, including Let It Be and Tim, Bob Stinson was kicked out of the band in 1986, and Slim Dunlap joined as lead guitarist. Steve Foley replaced Mars in 1990. Towards the end of the band's career, Westerberg exerted more control over the creative output. The group disbanded in 1991, with the members eventually pursuing various projects. A reunion was announced on October 3, 2012.[4] The band is referred to by their nickname \"The 'Mats\" by fans, which originated as a truncation of \"The Placemats,\" a mispronunciation of their name.[5]","image":"The_Replacements_(band).jpg.webp"}
