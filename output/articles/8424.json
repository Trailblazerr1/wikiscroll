{"title":"Canning","summary":"Canning is a method of food preservation in which food is processed and sealed in an airtight container (jars like Mason jars, and steel and tin cans). Canning provides a shelf life that typically ranges from one to five years, although under specific circumstances, it can be much longer.[1] A freeze-dried canned product, such as canned dried lentils, could last as long as 30 years in an edible state.","image":"Numerous_stacked_cans%2C_several_types_and_brands.jpg.webp","url":"Canning"}
