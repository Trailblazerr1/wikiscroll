{"title":"Enhanced interrogation techniques","summary":"\"Enhanced interrogation techniques\" or \"enhanced interrogation\" is a euphemism for the program of systematic torture of detainees by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and various components of the U.S. Armed Forces at remote sites around the world, including Bagram, Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and Bucharest authorized by officials of the George W. Bush administration.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] Methods used included beating, binding in contorted stress positions, hooding, subjection to deafening noise, sleep disruption,[8] sleep deprivation to the point of hallucination, deprivation of food, drink, and medical care for wounds, as well as waterboarding, walling, sexual humiliation, subjection to extreme heat or extreme cold, and confinement in small coffin-like boxes.[9][10][11] A Guantanamo inmate's drawings of some of these tortures, to which he himself was subjected, were published in The New York Times.[12] Some of these techniques fall under the category known as \"white torture\".[13] Several detainees endured medically unnecessary[14] \"rectal rehydration\", \"rectal fluid resuscitation\", and \"rectal feeding\".[15][16] In addition to brutalizing detainees, there were threats to their families such as threats to harm children, and threats to sexually abuse or to cut the throat of detainees' mothers.[17]","image":"West_Coast_U.S._Navy_SERE_insignia.png.webp"}
