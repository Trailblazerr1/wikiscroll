{"title":"Brunello di Montalcino","summary":"Brunello di Montalcino is a red DOCG Italian wine produced in the vineyards surrounding the town of Montalcino, in the province of Siena, located about 80Â km south of Florence in the Tuscany wine region. Brunello, a diminutive of Bruno (\"brown\"), is the name that was given locally to what was believed to be an individual grape variety grown in Montalcino. In 1879 the Province of Siena's Amphelographic Commission determined, after a few years of controlled experiments, that Sangiovese and Brunello were the same grape variety, and that the former should be its designated name.[1] In Montalcino the name Brunello evolved into the designation of the wine produced with 100% Sangiovese.","image":"Montalcino_001.jpg.webp","url":"Brunello_di_Montalcino"}
