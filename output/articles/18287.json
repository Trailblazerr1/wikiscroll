{"title":"Glycemic index","summary":"The glycemic index (GI; /ɡlaɪˈsiːmɪk/[1]) is a number from 0 to 100 assigned to a food, with pure glucose arbitrarily given the value of 100, which represents the relative rise in the blood glucose level two hours after consuming that food.[2] The GI of a specific food depends primarily on the quantity and type of carbohydrate it contains, but is also affected by the amount of entrapment of the carbohydrate molecules within the food, the fat and protein content of the food, the amount of organic acids (or their salts) in the food, and whether it is cooked and, if so, how it is cooked.  GI tables, which list many types of foods and their GIs, are available.[3] A food is considered to have a  low GI if it is 55 or less; high GI if 70 or more; and mid-range GI if 56 to 69.","image":"Suckale08_fig3_glucose_insulin_day.png.webp"}
