{"title":"Caesar (cocktail)","summary":"A Caesar (also known as a Bloody Caesar) is a cocktail created and consumed primarily in Canada.  It typically contains vodka, a caesar mix (a blend of tomato juice and clam broth), hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, and is served with ice in a large, celery salt-rimmed glass, typically garnished with a stalk of celery and wedge of lime.[1] What distinguishes it from a Bloody Mary is the inclusion of clam broth. The cocktail may also be contrasted with the Michelada, which has similar flavouring ingredients but uses beer instead of vodka.","image":"Bloody_Caesar.jpg.webp"}
