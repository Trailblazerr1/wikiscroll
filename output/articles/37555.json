{"title":"Reliability of Wikipedia","summary":"The reliability of Wikipedia concerns the validity, verifiability, and veracity of Wikipedia and its user-generated editing model, particularly its English-language edition. It is written and edited by volunteer editors who generate online content with the editorial oversight of other volunteer editors via community-generated policies and guidelines. Wikipedia carries the general disclaimer that it can be \"edited by anyone at any time\" and maintains an inclusion threshold of \"verifiability, not truth.\" This editing model is highly concentrated as 77% of all articles are written by 1% of its editors, a majority of whom are anonymous.[1][2] The reliability of the project has been tested statistically, through comparative review, analysis of the historical patterns, and strengths and weaknesses inherent in its editing process.[3] The online encyclopedia has been criticized for its factual reliability, principally regarding its content, presentation, and editorial processes. Studies and surveys attempting to gauge the reliability of Wikipedia have been mixed, with findings varied and inconsistent.","image":"Coati_(Nasua_nasua)_at_Parque_Nacional_da_Serra_dos_Órgãos%2C_Teresópolis%2C_Brazil.jpg.webp","url":"Reliability_of_Wikipedia"}
