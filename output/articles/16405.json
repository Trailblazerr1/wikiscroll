{"title":"Flag of Texas","summary":"The flag of Texas is the official flag of the U.S. state of Texas. It is well known for its prominent single white star which gives the flag its commonly-used name: \"Lone Star Flag\". This lone star, in turn, gives rise to the state's nickname: \"The Lone Star State\". The flag, flown at homes and businesses statewide, is highly popular among Texans and is treated with a great degree of reverence and esteem within Texas. Along with the flag of Hawaii, it is one of two state flags to have previously served as a national flag.[3] In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the Texas flag second, behind New Mexico.[4]","image":"Flag_of_Texas.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Texas"}
