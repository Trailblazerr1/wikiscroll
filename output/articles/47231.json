{"title":"Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church","summary":"In the Catholic Church, the veneration of Mary, mother of Jesus, encompasses various Marian devotions which include prayer, pious acts, visual arts, poetry, and music devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary.[1][2] Popes have encouraged it, while also taking steps to reform some manifestations of it.[note 1] The Holy See has insisted on the importance of distinguishing \"true from false devotion, and authentic doctrine from its deformations by excess or defect\".[3] There are significantly more titles, feasts, and venerative Marian practices among Roman Catholics than in other Western Christian traditions.[4] The term hyperdulia indicates the special veneration due to Mary, greater than the ordinary dulia for other saints, but utterly unlike the latria due only to God.","image":"SIMONE_MARTINI_Maest√†_(detail)_1315.jpg.webp"}
