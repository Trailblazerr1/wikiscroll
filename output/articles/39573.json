{"title":"Scapegoat","summary":"In the Bible, a scapegoat is one of two kid goats.  As a pair, one goat was sacrificed (not a scapegoat) and the living “scapegoat” was released into the wilderness, taking with it all sins and impurities. The concept first appears in Leviticus, in which a goat is designated to be cast into the desert to carry away the sins of the community.","image":"William_Holman_Hunt_-_The_Scapegoat.jpg.webp"}
