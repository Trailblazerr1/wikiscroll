{"title":"Maternal death","summary":"Maternal death or maternal mortality is defined in slightly different ways by several different health organizations. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal death as the death of a pregnant person due to complications related to pregnancy, underlying conditions worsened by the pregnancy or management of these conditions. This can occur either while the person is pregnant or within six weeks of resolution of the pregnancy.[1] The CDC definition of pregnancy-related deaths extends the period of consideration to include one year from the resolution of the pregnancy.[2][3] Pregnancy associated death, as defined by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), are all deaths occurring within one year of a pregnancy resolution.[4] Identification of pregnancy associated deaths is important for deciding whether or not the pregnancy was a direct or indirect contributing cause of the death.","image":"A_mother_dies_and_is_taken_by_angels_as_her_new-born_child_is_taken_away%2C_A_grave_from_1863_in_Striesener_Friedhof_in_Dresden.jpg.webp"}
