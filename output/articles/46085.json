{"title":"Trypanosoma brucei","summary":"Trypanosoma brucei is a species of parasitic kinetoplastid belonging to the genus Trypanosoma. This parasite is the cause of vector-borne diseases of vertebrate animals, including humans, carried by species of tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. In humans T. brucei causes African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. In animals it causes animal trypanosomiasis, also called nagana in cattle and horses. T. brucei has traditionally been grouped into three subspecies: T. b. brucei, T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense.[1] The first is a parasite of non-human vertebrates, while the latter two are known to be parasites of humans. Only rarely can the T. b. brucei infect a human.[2]","image":"Tb_brucei.jpg.webp"}
