{"title":"Alec Douglas-Home","summary":"Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home, Baron Home of the Hirsel, KT, PC, JP, DL[1] (/ˈhjuːm/ (listen); 2 July 1903 – 9 October 1995) was a British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1963 to 1964. He was the only British prime minister born during the Edwardian era, and the last to hold office while a member of the House of Lords, before disclaiming his peerage and taking up a seat in the House of Commons for the remainder of his premiership. His reputation, however, rests more on his two periods serving as Britain's foreign minister than on his brief premiership.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
