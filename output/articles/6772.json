{"title":"Black-headed gull","summary":"The black-headed gull  (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) is a small gull that breeds in much of  the Palearctic including Europe and also in coastal eastern Canada. Most of the population is migratory and winters further south, but some birds reside in the milder westernmost areas of Europe. Small numbers also occur in northeastern North America, where it was formerly known as the common black-headed gull. As is the case with many gulls, it was previously placed in the genus Larus.","image":"Chroicocephalus_ridibundus_(summer).jpg.webp"}
