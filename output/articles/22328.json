{"title":"Intramuscular injection","summary":"Intramuscular injection, often abbreviated IM, is the injection of a substance into a muscle. In medicine, it is one of several methods for parenteral administration of medications. Intramuscular injection may be preferred because muscles have larger and more numerous blood vessels than subcutaneous tissue, leading to faster absorption than subcutaneous or intradermal injections.[1]: 751  Medication administered via intramuscular injection is not subject to the first-pass metabolism effect which affects oral medications.","image":"Bracing_for_a_short%2C_sharp_jab.jpg.webp"}
