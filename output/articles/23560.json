{"title":"Johann Pachelbel","summary":"Johann Pachelbel[n 1] (baptised 1 September 1653[n 2] â€“ buried 9 March 1706; also Bachelbel) was a German composer, organist, and teacher who brought the south German organ schools to their peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque era.[1]","image":"Johann_Pachelbel_Signature.svg.png.webp","url":"Johann_Pachelbel"}
