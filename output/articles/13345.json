{"title":"Dominatrix","summary":"A dominatrix (/ˌdɒmɪˈneɪtrɪks/, plural dominatrices /-ˈneɪtrɪsiːz, -nəˈtraɪ-/) is a woman who takes the dominant role in BDSM activities. A dominatrix might be of any sexual orientation, but her orientation does not necessarily limit the genders of her submissive partners. Dominatrices are known for inflicting physical pain on their submissives, but this is not done in every case. In some instances erotic humiliation is used, such as verbal humiliation or the assignment of humiliating tasks. Dominatrices also make use of other forms of servitude. A dominatrix is typically a paid professional (pro-domme) as the term dominatrix is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene.","image":"Giovanni_Buonconsiglio_-_Arystoteles_i_Filis.jpg.webp","url":"Dominatrix"}
