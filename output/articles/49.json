It fulfills a central role in mathematics as the additive identity of the integers, real numbers, and many other algebraic structures. As a digit, 0 is used as a placeholder in place value systems. Names for the number 0 in English include zero, nought (UK), naught (US; /nɔːt/), nil, or—in contexts where at least one adjacent digit distinguishes it from the letter \"O\"—oh or o (/oʊ/). Informal or slang terms for zero include zilch and zip.[2] Ought and aught (/ɔːt/),[3] as well as cipher,[4] have also been used historically.[5][6]","image":"hiero_F35.png.webp","url":"0"}
