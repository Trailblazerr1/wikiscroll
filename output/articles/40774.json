{"title":"Sindarin","summary":"Sindarin is one of the fictional languages devised by J. R. R. Tolkien[T 1] for use in his fantasy stories set in Arda, primarily in Middle-earth. Sindarin is one of the many languages spoken by the Elves, called the Eledhrim [ɛˈlɛðrɪm] or Edhellim [ɛˈðɛlːɪm] in Sindarin. The word Sindarin is itself a Quenya form, as the Sindar, or \"Grey Elves\" themselves did not have a name for it, likely simply calling it Edhellen (Elvish).","image":"Tolkien_1916.jpg.webp"}
