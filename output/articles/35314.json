{"title":"Pointe shoe","summary":"A pointe shoe (UK: /pwæ̃t/, US: /pwɑːnt, pɔːɪnt/); is a type of shoe worn by ballet dancers when performing pointe work. Pointe shoes were conceived in response to the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe (on the tips of their toes) for extended periods of time. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink.","image":"PointeShoes.jpg.webp","url":"Pointe_shoe"}
