{"title":"European water vole","summary":"The European water vole or northern water vole (Arvicola amphibius), is a semi-aquatic rodent. It is often informally called the water rat, though it only superficially resembles a true rat.[3]  Water voles have rounder noses than rats, deep brown fur, chubby faces and short fuzzy ears; unlike rats their tails, paws and ears are covered with hair.","image":"Water_Vole_on_Boot_Hill_(5592665124).jpg.webp"}
