{"title":"Laurasia","summary":"Laurasia (/lɔːˈreɪʒə, -ʃiə/)[1] was the more northern of two large landmasses that formed part of the Pangaea supercontinent from around 335 to 175 million years ago (Mya), the other being Gondwana. It separated from Gondwana 215 to 175 Mya (beginning in the late Triassic period) during the breakup of Pangaea, drifting farther north after the split and finally broke apart with the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean c. 56 Mya. The name is a blend of Laurentia and Asia.[2]","image":"Laurasia_200Ma.jpg.webp","url":"Laurasia"}
