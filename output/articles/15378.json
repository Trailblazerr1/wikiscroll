{"title":"European hornet","summary":"The European hornet (Vespa crabro) is the largest eusocial wasp native to Europe. It is also the only true hornet (genus Vespa) found in North America, having been introduced by European settlers in the 1800s.[1][2] V. crabro is usually regarded as a pest by those humans who come into contact with it. Vespines, such as V. crabro, are known for making intricate paper-like nests out of surrounding plant materials and other fibers.[3] Unlike most other vespines, reproductive suppression involves worker policing instead of queen pheromone control, as was previously thought.","image":"VespaCrabroCollezione.jpg.webp","url":"European_hornet"}
