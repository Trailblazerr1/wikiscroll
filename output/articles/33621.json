{"title":"Pacifism","summary":"Pacifism is opposition to war, militarism (including conscription and mandatory military service) or violence. The word pacifism was coined by the French peace campaigner Ã‰mile Arnaud and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901.[1] A related term is ahimsa (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in Indian Religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.","image":"Peace_sign.svg.png.webp","url":"Pacifism"}
