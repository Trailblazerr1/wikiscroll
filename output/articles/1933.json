{"title":"Abortion–breast cancer hypothesis","summary":"The abortion–breast cancer hypothesis is a pseudoscientific belief that having an induced abortion can increase the risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis is at odds with mainstream scientific opinion and is rejected by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is altered by an abortion, then more immature cells could be left behind, and that these immature cells could increase the risk of breast cancer over time.[1]","image":"Breast_anatomy_drawing.png.webp","url":"Abortion–breast_cancer_hypothesis"}
