{"title":"Solipsism","summary":"Solipsism (/ˈsɒlɪpsɪzəm/ (listen); from Latin  solus 'alone', and  ipse 'self')[1] is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
