{"title":"Carillon","summary":"A carillon (US: /ˈkærəlɒn/ CARE-ə-lon or UK: /kəˈrɪljən/ kə-RILL-yən;[2]) is a pitched percussion instrument that is played with a keyboard and consists of at least 23 cast bronze bells in fixed suspension and tuned in chromatic order so that they can be sounded harmoniously together. Often housed in bell towers, carillons are usually owned by churches, universities, or municipalities. The bells are struck with clappers connected to a keyboard of wooden batons played with the hands and pedals played with the feet. Often, carillons include an automatic system through which the time is announced and simple tunes are played throughout the day.","image":"MayoClinicCarillonneur.jpg.webp"}
