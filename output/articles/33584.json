{"title":"PFA Young Player of the Year","summary":"The Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year (often called the PFA Young Player of the Year, or simply the Young Player of the Year) is an annual award given to the young player who is adjudged to have been the best of the season in English football.  As of 2021, players must have been aged 21 or under as of 1 July immediately preceding the start of the season;[1] in the past the age limit has been 23, which led to criticism in the media over whether a player who was 24 years old at the end of the season could really be considered \"young\" in footballing terms.[2][3] The award has been presented since the 1973â€“74 season and the winner is chosen by a vote amongst the members of the players' trade union, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA). The first winner of the award was Ipswich Town defender Kevin Beattie. The current holder is Phil Foden, who won the award on 6 June 2021.","image":"Phil_Foden_(36502388741).jpg.webp","url":"PFA_Young_Player_of_the_Year"}
