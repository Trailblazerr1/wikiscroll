{"title":"Human rights in China","summary":"Human rights in mainland China are periodically reviewed by the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC),[1] on which the government of the People's Republic of China and various foreign governments and human rights organizations have often disagreed. PRC authorities, their supporters, and other proponents claim that existing policies and enforcement measures are sufficient to guard against human rights abuses. However other countries and their authorities (such as the United States Department of State, Global Affairs Canada, etc.), international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) including Human Rights in China and Amnesty International, and citizens, lawyers, and dissidents inside the country, state that the authorities in mainland China regularly sanction or organize such abuses.","image":"National_Emblem_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China_(2).svg.png.webp","url":"Human_rights_in_China"}
