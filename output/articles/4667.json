{"title":"Assassination","summary":"Assassination is the murder of a prominent or important person,[1] such as a head of state, head of government, politician, member of a royal family, or CEO. An assassination may be prompted by political and military motives, or done for financial gain, to avenge a grievance, from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety, or because of a military, security, insurgent or secret police group's command to carry out the assassination. Acts of assassination have been performed since ancient times. A person who carried out an assassination is called an assassin or hitman.","image":"Schauman_shoots_Bobrikov.jpg.webp","url":"Assassination"}
