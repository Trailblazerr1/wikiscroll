{"title":"g-force","summary":"The gravitational force equivalent, or, more commonly, g-force, is a measurement of the type of force per unit mass – typically acceleration – that causes a perception of weight, with a g-force of 1 g (not gram in mass measurement) equal to the conventional value of gravitational acceleration on Earth, g, of about 9.8 m/s2.[1] Since g-forces indirectly produce weight, any g-force can be described as a \"weight per unit mass\" (see the synonym specific weight). When the g-force is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object, the reaction force to this push produces an equal and opposite weight for every unit of an object's mass. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. Gravitational acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall.[2][3]","image":"Load_factor_and_the_g-force_in_turn.svg.png.webp","url":"G-force"}
