{"title":"Catholic particular churches and liturgical rites","summary":"A particular church (Latin: ecclesia particularis) is an ecclesiastical community of faithful headed by a bishop (or equivalent), as defined by Catholic canon law and ecclesiology. A liturgical rite depends on the particular church the bishop (or equivalent) belongs to. Thus \"particular church\" refers to an institution, and \"liturgical rite\" to its ritual practices.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp","url":"Catholic_particular_churches_and_liturgical_rites"}
