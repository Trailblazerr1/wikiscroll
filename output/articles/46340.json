{"title":"Tōrō","summary":"In Japan, a tōrō (灯籠 / 灯篭, 灯楼, light basket, light tower)[note 1] is a traditional lantern made of stone, wood, or metal. Like many other elements of Japanese traditional architecture, it originated in China where they can still be found in Buddhist temples and Chinese gardens. They are not as common in Korea and Vietnam as they are in China or Japan.[1] In Japan, tōrō were originally used only in Buddhist temples, where they lined and illuminated paths. Lit lanterns were then considered an offering to Buddha.[2] Their use in Shinto shrines and also private homes started during the Heian period (794–1185).[3]","image":"HiroshimaShukkeienLantern7324.jpg.webp","url":"Tōrō"}
