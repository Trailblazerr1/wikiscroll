{"title":"Eva Braun","summary":"Eva Anna Paula Hitler (née Braun; 6 February 1912 – 30 April 1945) was a German photographer who was the longtime companion and later the wife of Adolf Hitler. The two first met in Munich when she was a 17-year-old assistant and model for his personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann; she began seeing Hitler often about two years later. Braun took many of the surviving colour photographs and films of Hitler. She attempted suicide twice during their early relationship. By 1936, Braun was a part of Hitler's household at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden and lived a sheltered life throughout World War II. She became a key figure within Hitler's inner social circle, but did not attend public events with him until mid-1944, when her sister Gretl married Hermann Fegelein, the SS liaison officer on his staff.","image":"Eva_Braun_walking_dog.jpg.webp"}
