{"title":"Chromosome","summary":"A chromosome is a long DNA molecule with part or all of the genetic material of an organism. Most eukaryotic chromosomes include packaging proteins called histones which, aided by chaperone proteins, bind to and condense the DNA molecule to maintain its integrity.[1][2] These chromosomes display a complex three-dimensional structure, which plays a significant role in transcriptional regulation.[3]","image":"Hybridogenesis_in_water_frogs_gametes.svg.png.webp","url":"Chromosome"}
