{"title":"Bat","summary":"Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera.[lower-alpha 1] With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight. Bats are more maneuverable than most birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1+1⁄8–1+3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes, with the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, reaching a weight of 1.6 kg (3+1⁄2 lb) and having a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).","image":"Wikipedia-Bats-001-v01.jpg.webp"}
