{"title":"Liquidation","summary":"Liquidation is the process in accounting by which a company is brought to an end in Canada, United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and many other countries. The assets and property of the company are redistributed. Liquidation is also sometimes referred to as winding-up or dissolution, although dissolution technically refers to the last stage of liquidation. The process of liquidation also arises when customs, an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting and safeguarding customs duties, determines the final computation or ascertainment of the duties or drawback accruing on an entry.[1]","image":"Peter_Paul_Rubens_(1577-1640)_(style_of)_-_A_Hand_Holding_an_Empty_Purse%2C_The_Emblem_of%2C_â€˜No_suffering_can_compare'_(with_that_of_the_bankrupt_spendthrift)_-_1298194_-_National_Trust.jpg.webp","url":"Liquidation"}
