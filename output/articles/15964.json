{"title":"Felony","summary":"A felony is traditionally considered a crime of high seriousness, whereas a misdemeanor is regarded as less serious.[1] The term \"felony\" originated from English common law (from the French medieval word \"f√©lonie\") to describe an offense that resulted in the confiscation of a convicted person's land and goods, to which additional punishments including capital punishment could be added;[2] other crimes were called misdemeanors. Following conviction of a felony in a court of law, a person may be described as a felon or a convicted felon.","image":"page1-220px-Felony_Sentences_in_State_Courts.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Felony"}
