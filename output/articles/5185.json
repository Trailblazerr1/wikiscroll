He introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending, shimmering vibrato and staccato picking that influenced many later blues electric guitar players.[5][6] AllMusic recognized King as \"the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th century\".[6]","image":"B.B._King_(46264650642).jpg.webp"}
