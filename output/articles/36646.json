{"title":"Qarmatians","summary":"The Qarmatians (Arabic: قرامطة‎, romanized: Qarāmiṭa; Persian: قرمطیان‎, romanized: Qarmatiyān; also transliterated Carmathians, Qarmathians, Karmathians, Karmatian, or Karmathian, Qarmatī, Qarāmiṭah[1]) were an Iranian dynasty of a syncretic branch of Sevener Ismaili Shia Islam.[2][3] They were centred in al-Hasa (Eastern Arabia), where they established a religious-utopian republic in 899 CE. They rejected the claim of Fatimid caliph Ubayd Allah to imamate and clung to their belief in the coming of the Mahdi, and they revolted against the Fatimid and Abbasid Caliphates.[4][5]","image":"Qarmatian_Republic.png.webp","url":"Qarmatians"}
