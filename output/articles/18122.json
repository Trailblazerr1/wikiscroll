{"title":"Gion Matsuri","summary":"The Gion Festival (祇園祭, Gion Matsuri) takes place annually during the month of July in Kyoto and is one of the most famous and largest festivals in Japan.[1] It's formally part of Japan's indigenous, nature-based Shinto faith, and its original purposes were purification and pacification of disease-causing entities.[2]  There are many ceremonies held during the festival, but it is best known for its two Yamaboko Junkō (山鉾巡行) processions of floats, which take place on July 17th and 24th.[3] Many festival events take place in the historic kimono district[4] in central Kyoto, and at the Yasaka Shrine. The Shinto Yasaka Shrine is the festival's patron shrine. It's located in Kyoto's famous Gion district, which gives the festival its name.[1]","image":"Yoiyama_-_The_Gion_Festival_-_July_14%2C_2008.jpg.webp"}
