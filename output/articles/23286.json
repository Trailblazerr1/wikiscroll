{"title":"Jerky","summary":"Jerky is lean trimmed meat that has been cut into strips and dried (dehydrated) to prevent spoilage. Normally, this drying includes the addition of salt to prevent bacteria growth before the meat has finished the dehydrating process. The word \"jerky\" derives from the Quechua word ch'arki which means \"dried, salted meat\".[1][2][3] All that is needed to produce basic \"jerky\" is a low-temperature drying method, and salt to inhibit bacterial growth.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Jerky"}
