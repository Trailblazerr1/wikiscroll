It was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. A moderate-sized deer, male chital reach nearly 90 cm (35 in) and females 70 cm (28 in) at the shoulder. While males weigh 30–75 kg (66–165 lb), the lighter females weigh 25–45 kg (55–99 lb). It is sexually dimorphic; males are larger than females, and antlers are present only on males.

The antlers, three-pronged, are nearly 1 m (3 ft 3 in) long.","image":"A_chital_stag_1.JPG.webp","url":"Chital"}
