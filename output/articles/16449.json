{"title":"Flavin adenine dinucleotide","summary":"In biochemistry, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a redox-active coenzyme associated with various proteins, which is involved with several enzymatic reactions in metabolism. A flavoprotein is a protein that contains a flavin group, which may be in the form of FAD or flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Many flavoproteins are known: components of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, Î±-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.","image":"FAD.png.webp","url":"Flavin_adenine_dinucleotide"}
