{"title":"Folate","summary":"Folate, also known as vitamin B9 and folacin,[6] is one of the B vitamins.[3] Manufactured folic acid, which is converted into folate by the body, is used as a dietary supplement and in food fortification as it is more stable during processing and storage.[7] Folate is required for the body to make DNA and RNA and metabolise amino acids necessary for cell division.[1][8] As humans cannot make folate, it is required in the diet, making it an essential nutrient.[9] It occurs naturally in many foods.[6][1] The recommended adult daily intake of folate in the U.S. is 400 micrograms from foods or dietary supplements.[1]","image":"Folic_acid.svg.png.webp","url":"Folate"}
