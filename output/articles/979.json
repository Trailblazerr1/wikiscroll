{"title":"Adrenaline","summary":"Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, is a hormone and medication[7][8] which is involved in regulating visceral functions (e.g., respiration).[7][9] Adrenaline is normally produced both by the adrenal glands and by a small number of neurons in the medulla oblongata. It plays an important role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles, output of the heart by acting on the SA node,[10] pupil dilation response and blood sugar level.[11][12] It does this by binding to alpha and beta receptors.[12] It is found in many animals and some single-celled organisms.[13][14] Polish physiologist Napoleon Cybulski first isolated adrenaline in 1895.[15]","image":"Epinephrine.svg.png.webp"}
