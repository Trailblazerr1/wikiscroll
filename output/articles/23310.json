{"title":"Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916","summary":"The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 were a series of shark attacks along the coast of New Jersey, in the United States, between July 1 and 12, 1916, in which four people were killed and one injured. The incidents occurred during a deadly summer heat wave and polio epidemic in the United States that drove thousands of people to the seaside resorts of the Jersey Shore. Since 1916, scholars have debated which shark species was responsible and the number of animals involved, with the great white shark and the bull shark most frequently cited.","image":"PhiladelphiaInquirerJuly151916.gif","url":"Jersey_Shore_shark_attacks_of_1916"}
