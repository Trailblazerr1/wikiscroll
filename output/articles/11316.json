{"title":"Council of Chalcedon","summary":"The Council of Chalcedon (/kælˈsiːdən, ˈkælsɪdɒn/; Latin: Concilium Chalcedonense; Greek: Σύνοδος τῆς Χαλκηδόνος, Synodos tēs Chalkēdonos) was the fourth ecumenical council of the Christian church, convoked by Emperor Marcian. The council operated in Chalcedon, Bithynia (modern day Kadıköy, Turkey) from 8 October to 1 November 451[1] and was attended by 520 bishops or their representatives. The gathering itself continues to represent the largest and best-documented of early councils.[1] The principal purpose of the Council was to re-assert the doctrine of Council of Ephesus  against the heresy derivative of Eutyches and Nestorius.[2] Such heresies attempted to dismantle and separate Christ's divine nature from his humanity (Nestorianism) and further, to limit Christ as solely divine in nature (Monophysitism).[3]","image":"Fourth_ecumenical_council_of_chalcedon_-_1876.jpg.webp","url":"Council_of_Chalcedon"}
