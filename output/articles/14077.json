{"title":"Ecce homo","summary":"Ecce homo (/ˈɛksi ˈhoʊmoʊ/, Ecclesiastical Latin: [ˈettʃe ˈomo], Classical Latin: [ˈɛkkɛ ˈhɔmoː]; \"behold the man\") are the Latin words used by Pontius Pilate in the Vulgate translation of the Gospel of John, when he presents a scourged Jesus Christ, bound and crowned with thorns, to a hostile crowd shortly before his Crucifixion (John 19:5). The original New Testament Greek: \"ἰδοὺ ὁ ἄνθρωπος\", romanized: \"idoú ho ánthropos\", is rendered by most English Bible translations, e.g. Douay-Rheims Bible and King James Version, as \"behold the man\".[lower-alpha 1] The scene has been widely depicted in Christian art.","image":"Follower_of_Jheronimus_Bosch_029.jpg.webp","url":"Ecce_homo"}
