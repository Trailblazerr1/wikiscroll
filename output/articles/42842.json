{"title":"Superliner (railcar)","summary":"The Superliner is a type of bilevel intercity railroad passenger car used by Amtrak, the national rail passenger carrier in the United States. Amtrak ordered the cars to replace older single-level cars on its long-distance trains in the Western United States. The design was based on the Budd Hi-Level vehicles, employed by the Santa Fe Railway on its El Capitan trains. Pullman-Standard built 284 cars, known as Superliner I, from 1975 to 1981; Bombardier Transportation built 195, known as Superliner II, from 1991 to 1996. The Superliner I cars were the last passenger cars built by Pullman.","image":"AMTK_322_with_the_San_Francisco_Zephyr_at_Cape_Horn%2C_CA_in_November_1980_-_2_Photos_(30567817685).jpg.webp"}
