{"title":"List of Sega Genesis games","summary":"The Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive[1] in regions outside of North America, is a 16-bit video game console that was developed and sold by Sega. First released in Japan on October 29, 1988, in North America on August 14, 1989 and in PAL regions in 1990, the Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Master System. The system supports a library of 713 games created both by Sega and a wide array of third-party publishers and delivered on ROM cartridges.[2] It can also play the complete library of Master System games when the separately sold Power Base Converter is installed. The Sega Genesis also sported numerous peripherals, including the Sega CD and Sega 32X, several network services, and multiple first-party and third-party variations of the console that focused on extending its functionality.[3] The console and its games continue to be popular among fans, collectors, video game music fans, and emulation enthusiasts. Licensed third party re-releases of the console are still being produced,[4] and several indie game developers continue to produce games for it.[5] Many games have also been re-released in compilations for newer consoles and offered for download on various digital distribution services, such as Virtual Console, Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam.[6][7][8][9]","image":"Sega-Genesis-Mk2-6button.jpg.webp"}
