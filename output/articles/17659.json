{"title":"Genetic algorithm","summary":"In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.[1] Some examples of GA applications include optimizing decision trees for better performance, automatically solve sudoku puzzles,[2] hyperparameter optimization, etc.","image":"St_5-xband-antenna.jpg.webp"}
