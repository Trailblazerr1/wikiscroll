{"title":"Mauna Kea","summary":"Mauna Kea (/ˌmaʊnə ˈkeɪə/;[6] Hawaiian: [ˈmɐwnə ˈkɛjə]; abbreviation for Mauna a Wākea)[7] is a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaiʻi. Its peak is 4,207.3 m (13,803 ft) above sea level, making it the highest point in the state of Hawaiʻi and second-highest peak of an island on Earth. The peak is about 38 m (125 ft) higher than Mauna Loa, its more massive neighbor. Mauna Kea is unusually topographically prominent for its height: its wet prominence is fifteenth in the world among mountains, at 4,207.3 m (13,803 ft); its dry prominence of 9,330 m (30,610 ft) is second in the world, only after Mount Everest.[8] This dry prominence is taller than Mount Everest's height above sea level of 8,848.86 m (29,032 ft), and some authorities have labelled Mauna Kea the tallest mountain in the world, from its underwater base.[lower-alpha 1]","image":"Mauna_Kea_from_the_ocean.jpg.webp"}
