{"title":"Implicit function","summary":"In mathematics, an implicit equation is a relation of the form R(x1, …, xn) = 0, where R is a function of several variables (often a polynomial). For example, the implicit equation of the unit circle is x2 + y2 − 1 = 0.","image":"26c08f8fd3471dad5e2c45c2f753ffd7c9aba4ed.svg","url":"Implicit_function"}
