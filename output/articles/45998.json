{"title":"Triton (moon)","summary":"Triton is the largest natural satellite of the planet Neptune, and was the first Neptunian moon to be discovered, on October 10, 1846, by English astronomer William Lassell. It is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit, an orbit in the direction opposite to its planet's rotation.[3][12] Because of its retrograde orbit and composition similar to Pluto, Triton is thought to have been a dwarf planet, captured from the Kuiper belt.[13]","image":"Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_(large).jpg.webp","url":"Triton_(moon)"}
