{"title":"God in Judaism","summary":"God in Judaism is the eternal Supreme Being who created and preserves all things.[1] In Judaism, God has been conceived in a variety of ways.[2] Traditionally, Judaism holds that Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and the national god of the Israelites, delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, and gave them the Law of Moses at biblical Mount Sinai as described in the Torah.[1][3][4] Jews traditionally believe in a monotheistic conception of God (God is only one), which is both transcendent (wholly independent of, and removed from, the material universe) and immanent (involved in the material universe).[1]","image":"Star_of_David.svg.png.webp"}
