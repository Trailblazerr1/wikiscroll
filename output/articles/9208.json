{"title":"Chamomile","summary":"Chamomile (American English) or camomile (British English; see spelling differences) (/ˈkæməmaɪl, -miːl/ KAM-ə-myl or KAM-ə-meel[1][2]), is the common name for several daisy-like plants of the family Asteraceae. Two of the species, Matricaria recutita, and Anthemis nobilis are commonly used to make herbal infusions for traditional medicine.[3][4][5] Although there is insufficient scientific evidence that consuming chamomile in foods or beverages has any beneficial effect on health,[4][5] Chamomile is famous for its traditional use in a variety of applications. Many individuals advocate and utilize chamomile flower dry powder for numerous conventional health issues due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and mild astringent properties.[6]","image":"Kamomillasaunio_(Matricaria_recutita).JPG.webp"}
