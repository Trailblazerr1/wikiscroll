{"title":"Tampon","summary":"A tampon is a menstrual  product designed to absorb blood and vaginal secretions by insertion into the vagina during menstruation. Unlike a pad, it is placed internally, inside of the vaginal canal.[1] Once inserted correctly, a tampon is held in place by the vagina and expands as it soaks up menstrual blood. However, in addition to menstrual blood, the tampon also absorbs the vagina's natural lubrication and bacteria, which can change the normal pH, increasing the risk of infections from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which can lead to toxic shock syndrome (TSS).[1][2] TSS is a rare but life-threatening infection that requires immediate medical attention.[3]","image":"Gestion_menstrual_tampon_toallitas_menstruaci√≥n_periodicas_06.jpg.webp","url":"Tampon"}
