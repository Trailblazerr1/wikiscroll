{"title":"Italians","summary":"Italians (Italian: italiani [itaˈljaːni]) are a Romance[44][45][46] ethnic group native to the Italian geographical region and its neighboring insular territories. Italians share a common culture, history, ancestry and language.[47][48][49][50] Legally, Italian nationals are citizens of Italy, regardless of ancestry or nation of residence (in effect, however, Italian nationality is largely based on jus sanguinis) and may be distinguished from ethnic Italians in general or from people of Italian descent without Italian citizenship and ethnic Italians living in territories adjacent to the Italian peninsula without Italian citizenship.[51][52]","image":"Flag_of_Italy.svg.png.webp","url":"Italians"}
