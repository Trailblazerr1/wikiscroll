{"title":"Lie group","summary":"In mathematics, a Lie group (pronounced /liÀê/ \"Lee\") is a group that is also a differentiable manifold. A manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space, whereas groups define the abstract, generic concept of multiplication and the taking of inverses (division). Combining these two ideas, one obtains a continuous group where points can be multiplied together, and their inverse can be taken. If, in addition, the multiplication and taking of inverses are defined to be smooth (differentiable), one obtains a Lie group.","image":"E8Petrie.svg.png.webp","url":"Lie_group"}
