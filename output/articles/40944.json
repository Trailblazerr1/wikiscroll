{"title":"Slavery in the 21st century","summary":"Contemporary slavery,  also  sometimes known as modern slavery or neo-slavery, refers to institutional slavery that continues to occur in present-day society. Estimates of the number of slaves today range from around 38 million[1] to 46 million,[2][3] depending on the method used to form the estimate and the definition of slavery being used.[4] The estimated number of slaves is debated, as there is no universally agreed definition of modern slavery;[5] those in slavery are often difficult to identify, and adequate statistics are often not available. The International Labour Organization[6] estimates that, by their definitions, over 40 million people are in some form of slavery today. 24.9 million people are in forced labor, of whom 16 million people are exploited in the private sector such as domestic work, construction or agriculture;[7] 4.8 million persons in forced sexual exploitation, and 4 million persons in forced labor imposed by state authorities.[7] 15.4 million people are in forced marriage.[7]","image":"Maps_Global_Slavery_Index_2019.png.webp","url":"Slavery_in_the_21st_century"}
