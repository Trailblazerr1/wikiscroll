{"title":"Ultramontanism","summary":"Ultramontanism is a clerical political conception within the Catholic Church that places strong emphasis on the prerogatives and powers of the Pope. It contrasts with Gallicanism, the belief that popular civil authority—often represented by the monarch's or state's authority—over the Church is comparable to that of the Pope.","image":"Pope_Alexander_I.jpg.webp","url":"Ultramontanism"}
