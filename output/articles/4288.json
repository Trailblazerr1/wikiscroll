{"title":"Archimedes' principle","summary":"Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.[1] Archimedes' principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse.[2]","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg","url":"Archimedes'_principle"}
