In 1937, anticipating Nazi aggression leading to World War II, Lewis sold American Decca and the link between the UK and U.S. Decca labels was broken for several decades.[2] The British label was renowned for its development of recording methods, while the American company developed the concept of cast albums in the musical genre.","image":"Decca_Records.svg.png.webp","url":"Decca_Records"}
