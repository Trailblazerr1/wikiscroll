{"title":"Cistercians","summary":"The Cistercians, (/sɪˈstɜːrʃənz/)[1] officially the Order of Cistercians (Latin: (Sacer) Ordo Cisterciensis, abbreviated as OCist or SOCist), are a Catholic religious order of monks and nuns that branched off from the Benedictines and follow the Rule of Saint Benedict. They are also known as Bernardines, after the highly influential Bernard of Clairvaux or as White Monks, in reference to the colour of the \"cuculla\" or cowl (choir robe) worn by the Cistercians over their habits, as opposed to the black cowl worn by Benedictines.","image":"Ordre_cistercien.svg.png.webp","url":"Cistercians"}
