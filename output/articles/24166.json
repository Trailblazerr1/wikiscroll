{"title":"Junkers Ju 88","summary":"The Junkers Ju 88 is a German World War II Luftwaffe twin-engined multirole combat aircraft. Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works (JFM) designed the plane in the mid-1930s as a so-called Schnellbomber (\"fast bomber\") that would be too fast for fighters of its era to intercept. It suffered from technical problems during its development and early operational periods but became one of the most versatile combat aircraft of the war. Like a number of other Luftwaffe bombers, it served as a bomber, dive bomber, night fighter, torpedo bomber, reconnaissance aircraft, heavy fighter and at the end of the war, as a flying bomb.[2]","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-363-2258-11%2C_Flugzeug_Junkers_Ju_88_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
