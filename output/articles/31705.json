{"title":"Net present value","summary":"The net present value (NPV) or net present worth (NPW)[1] applies to a series of cash flows occurring at different times. The present value of a cash flow depends on the interval of time between now and the cash flow. It also depends on the discount rate. NPV accounts for the time value of money. It provides a method for evaluating and comparing capital projects or financial products with cash flows spread over time, as in loans, investments, payouts from insurance contracts plus many other applications.","image":"1f68845f40f008c8d7742f9ccfced99b7819852e.svg","url":"Net_present_value"}
