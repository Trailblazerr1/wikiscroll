{"title":"Chevrolet S-10 Blazer","summary":"The Chevrolet (S-10/T-10) Blazer and its badge engineered GMC (S-15/T-15) Jimmy counterpart are compact/mid-size SUVs manufactured and marketed by Chevrolet and GMC from the 1983 through 2005 model years, over two generations â€“ until the early 1990s alongside these brands' full-size SUVs with near identical nameplates, but lacking removable hardtops. From the 1992 model year, GMC's big Jimmy had become the 'Yukon', and so the S-15 prefix was dropped on the smaller GMC Jimmy. Starting with the 1995 second generation, the large Blazer was rebranded as the Chevrolet Tahoe, and these mid-size SUVs were simply launched as the 'all-new Chevrolet Blazer'.","image":"1st-Chevrolet-S10-Blazer-2door.jpg.webp","url":"Chevrolet_S-10_Blazer"}
