{"title":"The Disasters of War","summary":"The Disasters of War (Spanish: Los desastres de la guerra) is a series of 82[a 1] prints created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and printmaker Francisco Goya (1746–1828). Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates, art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising, the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808–1814 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814. During the conflicts between Napoleon's French Empire and Spain, Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers.[2] Although deeply affected by the war, he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath.[3]","image":"Prado_-_Los_Desastres_de_la_Guerra_-_No._03_-_Lo_mismo.jpg.webp","url":"The_Disasters_of_War"}
