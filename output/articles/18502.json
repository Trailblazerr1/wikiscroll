{"title":"Google Summer of Code","summary":"The Google Summer of Code, often abbreviated to GSoC, is an international annual program in which Google awards stipends to contributors who successfully complete a free and open-source software coding project during the summer. Beginning in 2022, the program is open to anyone aged 18 or over,[1] no longer just students and recent graduates. It was first held from May to August 2005.[2] The amount of the stipend depends on the purchasing power parity of the country where the student's university is located.[3] Project ideas are listed by host organizations involved in open-source software development, though students can also propose their own project ideas.","image":"GSoC-icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Google_Summer_of_Code"}
