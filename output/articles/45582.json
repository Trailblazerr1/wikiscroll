{"title":"Total quality management","summary":"Total quality management (TQM) consists of organization-wide efforts to \"install and make permanent climate where employees continuously improve their ability to provide on demand products and services that customers will find of particular value.\"[1]  \"Total\" emphasizes that departments in addition to production (for example sales and marketing, accounting and finance, engineering and design) are obligated to improve their operations; \"management\" emphasizes that executives are obligated to actively manage quality through funding, training, staffing, and goal setting.  While there is no widely agreed-upon approach, TQM efforts typically draw heavily on the previously developed tools and techniques of quality control. TQM enjoyed widespread attention during the late 1980s and early 1990s before being overshadowed by ISO 9000, Lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma.","image":"Factory.svg.png.webp","url":"Total_quality_management"}
