{"title":"Nitrous acid","summary":"Nitrous acid (molecular formula HNO2) is a weak and monoprotic acid known only in solution, in the gas phase and in the form of nitrite (NOâˆ’2) salts.[1]  Nitrous acid is used to make diazonium salts from amines.  The resulting diazonium salts are reagents in azo coupling reactions to give azo dyes.","image":"Nitrous_acid_acsv.svg.png.webp","url":"Nitrous_acid"}
