{"title":"Old Course at St Andrews","summary":"The Old Course at St Andrews, also known as the Old Lady or the Grand Old Lady,[2][3][4] is considered the oldest golf course in the world.[5][6] It is a public course over common land in St Andrews, Fife, Scotland and is held in trust by the St Andrews Links Trust under an act of Parliament. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews clubhouse sits adjacent to the first tee, although it is but one of many clubs (St Andrews Golf Club, The New Golf Club, St Regulus Ladies Golf Club and The St Rule Club are the others with clubhouses) that have playing privileges on the course, along with some other non-clubhouse owning clubs and the general public. Originally known as the \"golfing grounds\" of St Andrews, it was not until the New Course was opened in 1895 that it became known as the Old Course.[7]","image":"Brand-protection-Old-Course-course-logo.png.webp","url":"Old_Course_at_St_Andrews"}
