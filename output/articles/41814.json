{"title":"Spotted hyena","summary":"The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), also known as the laughing hyena,[3] is a hyena species, currently classed as the sole extant member of the genus Crocuta, native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is listed as being of least concern by the IUCN on account of its widespread range and large numbers estimated between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals.[1] The species is, however, experiencing declines outside of protected areas due to habitat loss and poaching.[1] The species may have originated in Asia,[4] and once ranged throughout Europe for at least one million years until the end of the Late Pleistocene.[5] The spotted hyena is the largest known member of the Hyaenidae, and is further physically distinguished from other species by its vaguely bear-like build,[6] its rounded ears,[7] its less prominent mane, its spotted pelt,[8] its more dual-purposed dentition,[9] its fewer nipples[10] and the presence of a pseudo-penis in the female. It is the only mammalian species to lack an external vaginal opening, having a pseudo-penis instead.[11]","image":"Spotted_hyena_(Crocuta_crocuta).jpg.webp","url":"Spotted_hyena"}
