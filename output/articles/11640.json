{"title":"Cubism","summary":"Cubism is an early-20th-century avant-garde art movement that revolutionized European painting and sculpture, and inspired related movements in music, literature and architecture. In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassembled in an abstracted formâ€”instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.[1] Cubism has been considered the most influential art movement of the 20th century.[2][3] The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art produced in Paris (Montmartre and Montparnasse) or near Paris (Puteaux) during the 1910s and throughout the 1920s.","image":"Pablo_Picasso%2C_1910%2C_Girl_with_a_Mandolin_(Fanny_Tellier)%2C_oil_on_canvas%2C_100.3_x_73.6_cm%2C_Museum_of_Modern_Art_New_York..jpg.webp"}
