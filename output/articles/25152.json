{"title":"Kurtosis","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, kurtosis (from Greek: κυρτός, kyrtos or kurtos, meaning \"curved, arching\") is a measure of the \"tailedness\" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. Like skewness, kurtosis describes the shape of a probability distribution and there are different ways of quantifying it for a theoretical distribution and corresponding ways of estimating it from a sample from a population. Different measures of kurtosis may have different interpretations.","image":"abb6badbf13364972b05d9249962f5ff87aba236.svg"}
