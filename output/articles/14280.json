{"title":"Edward the Martyr","summary":"Edward, often referred to by his epithet Edward the Martyr[lower-alpha 1] (Old English: Eadweard, pronounced [ˈæːɑdwæɑrˠd]; c. 962  – 18 March 978) was King of the English from 975 until he was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King Edgar the Peaceful but was not his father's acknowledged heir. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and others supporting his younger half-brother Æthelred the Unready, recognised as a legitimate son of Edgar. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, the archbishops Dunstan of Canterbury and Oswald of York.","image":"Edward_the_Martyr_-_MS_Royal_14_B_VI.jpg.webp","url":"Edward_the_Martyr"}
