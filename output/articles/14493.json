{"title":"Electrophile","summary":"In chemistry, an electrophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with nucleophiles by accepting an electron pair.[1] Because electrophiles accept electrons, they are Lewis acids.[2] Most electrophiles are positively charged, have an atom that carries a partial positive charge, or have an atom that does not have an octet of electrons.","image":"Electrophilic_addition_of_Br2.png.webp"}
