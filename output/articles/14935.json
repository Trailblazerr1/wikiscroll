{"title":"Enya","summary":"Enya Patricia Brennan (Irish: Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin /ˈɛnjə/; born 17 May 1961) is an Irish singer-songwriter and musician, who is best known for her recording of \"Orinoco Flow\". Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of Gweedore, County Donegal, Enya began her music career when she joined her family's Celtic folk band Clannad in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals. She left the group in 1982 with their manager and producer Nicky Ryan to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife Roma Ryan as her lyricist. Enya developed her sound over the following four years with multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements of new age, Celtic, classical, church, world, pop, and Irish folk. Thus far, she has sung in ten languages, most notably English, Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge), Latin, and Welsh.","image":"Enya_logo.svg.png.webp"}
