{"title":"List of winners of the New York City Marathon","summary":"The New York City Marathon, one of the six World Marathon Majors, is a 26.2-mile (42.2Â km) race which has been held in New York City since 1970. It is the largest marathon in the world; since 2013, every race except one has had over 50,000 finishers.[1][2] From 1970 through 1975, the race was held entirely in Central Park, but since 1976, the course has started in Staten Island and goes through each of the city's five boroughs.[3] The race was canceled in 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York less than a week before the race had been scheduled to take place.[4] The race was also cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the city.[5] In total, 35 men and 30 women have won the open division of the New York City Marathon, while nine men and seven women have won the wheelchair division. The winners have represented 22 different countries: Americans have won the marathon the most, doing so on 32 occasions; Kenyans have won 26 times; and Norwegians 10 times.[6][7][8]","image":"New_York_marathon_Verrazano_bridge.jpg.webp"}
