{"title":"Solar power","summary":"Solar power is the conversion of renewable energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and solar tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.[1]","image":"Electrical_and_Mechanical_Services_Department_Headquarters_Photovoltaics.jpg.webp","url":"Solar_power"}
