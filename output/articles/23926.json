{"title":"Jordan River (Utah)","summary":"The Jordan River, in the state of Utah, United States, is a river about 51 miles (82Â km) long. Regulated by pumps at its headwaters at Utah Lake, it flows northward through the Salt Lake Valley and empties into the Great Salt Lake. Four of Utah's six largest cities border the river: Salt Lake City, West Valley City, West Jordan and Sandy. More than a million people live in the Jordan Subbasin, which is the part of the Jordan River watershed that lies within Salt Lake and Utah counties. During the Pleistocene, the area was part of Lake Bonneville.","image":"Jordan_River_Dam%2C_1908-01-28.jpg.webp","url":"Jordan_River_(Utah)"}
