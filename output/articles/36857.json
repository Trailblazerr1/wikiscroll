{"title":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase","summary":"RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) or RNA replicase is an enzyme that catalyzes the replication of RNA from an RNA template. Specifically, it catalyzes synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template. This is in contrast to typical DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which all organisms use to catalyze the transcription of RNA from a DNA template.","image":"HCV_NS5B_RdRP_stalled_4WTG.png.webp","url":"RNA-dependent_RNA_polymerase"}
