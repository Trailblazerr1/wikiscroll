{"title":"Functional programming","summary":"In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values, rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running state of the program.","image":"75a0e680edceb47b7d233535262fcacd931585f8.svg","url":"Functional_programming"}
