{"title":"Read-only memory","summary":"Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be electronically modified after the manufacture of the memory device.  Read-only memory is useful for storing software that is rarely changed during the life of the system, also known as firmware. Software applications (like video games) for programmable devices can be distributed as plug-in cartridges containing ROM.","image":"4Mbit_EPROM_Texas_Instruments_TMS27C040_(1).jpg.webp","url":"Read-only_memory"}
