{"title":"Pyrrhus of Epirus","summary":"Pyrrhus (/ˈpɪrəs/; Greek: Πύρρος Pýrrhos; 319/318–272 BC) was a Greek king and statesman of the Hellenistic period.[1][2][3][4][5] He was king of the Greek tribe of Molossians,[4][6] of the royal Aeacid house,[7] and later he became king (Malalas also called him toparch[8]) of Epirus. He was one of the strongest opponents of early Rome, and regarded as one of the greatest generals of antiquity.[9] Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term \"Pyrrhic victory\" was coined.","image":"Pyrrhus_MAN_Napoli_Inv6150_n03.jpg.webp"}
