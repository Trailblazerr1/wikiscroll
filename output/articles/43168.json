{"title":"Systole","summary":"The systole (/ˈsɪstəli/ SIST-ə-lee) is the part of the cardiac cycle during which some chambers of the heart muscle contract after refilling with blood.[2]  The term originates, via New Latin, from Ancient Greek συστολή (sustolē), from συστέλλειν (sustéllein 'to contract'; from σύν sun 'together' + στέλλειν stéllein 'to send'), and is similar to the use of the English term to squeeze.","image":"Heart_systole.svg.png.webp","url":"Systole"}
