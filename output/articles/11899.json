{"title":"DNA polymerase","summary":"A DNA polymerase is a member of a family of enzymes that catalyze the synthesis of DNA molecules from nucleoside triphosphates, the molecular precursors of DNA. These enzymes are essential for DNA replication and usually work in groups to create two identical DNA duplexes from a single original DNA duplex. During this process, DNA polymerase \"reads\" the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones.[1][2][3][4][5][6] These enzymes catalyze the chemical reaction","image":"DNA_polymerase.png.webp","url":"DNA_polymerase"}
