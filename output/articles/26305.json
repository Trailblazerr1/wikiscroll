{"title":"Lipid raft","summary":"The plasma membranes of cells contain combinations of glycosphingolipids, cholesterol and protein receptors organised in glycolipoprotein lipid microdomains termed lipid rafts.[1][2][3] Their existence in cellular membranes remains somewhat controversial.  It has been proposed that they are specialized membrane microdomains which compartmentalize cellular processes by serving as organising centers for the assembly of signaling molecules, allowing a closer interaction of protein receptors and their effectors to promote kinetically favorable interactions necessary for the signal transduction.[4] Lipid rafts influence membrane fluidity and membrane protein trafficking, thereby regulating neurotransmission and receptor trafficking.[3][5] Lipid rafts are more ordered and tightly packed than the surrounding bilayer, but float freely within the membrane bilayer.[6] Although more common in the cell membrane, lipid rafts have also been reported in other parts of the cell, such as the Golgi apparatus and lysosomes.","image":"Lipid_raft_organisation_scheme.svg.png.webp","url":"Lipid_raft"}
