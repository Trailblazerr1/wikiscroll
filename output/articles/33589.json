{"title":"PID controller","summary":"A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value \n  \n    \n      \n        e\n        (\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e(t)}\n  \n as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.","image":"98cb518a61ada87bcd636f531d4d9fd2e67876c3.svg"}
