{"title":"Stephens City, Virginia","summary":"Stephens City (/ˈstiːvənz/ STEE-vənz) is an incorporated town in the southern part of Frederick County, Virginia, United States, with a population of 1,829 at the time of the 2010 census.[6] and an estimated population in 2018 of 2,041.[10] Founded by Peter Stephens in the 1730s, the colonial town was chartered and named for Lewis Stephens in October 1758. It was originally settled by German Protestants from Heidelberg. Stephens City is the second-oldest municipality in the Shenandoah Valley after nearby Winchester, which is about 5 miles (8 km) to the north. \"Crossroads\", the first free black community in the Valley in the pre-Civil War years, was founded east of town in the 1850s. Crossroads remained until the beginning of the Civil War when the freed blacks either escaped or were recaptured. Stephens City was saved from intentional burning in 1864 by Union Major Joseph K. Stearns. The town has gone through several name changes in its history, starting as \"Stephensburg\", then \"Newtown\", and finally winding up as \"Stephens City\", though it nearly became \"Pantops\". Interstate 81 and U.S. Route 11 pass close to and through the town, respectively.","image":"StephensCity_Route11_277_Xing.JPG.webp","url":"Stephens_City,_Virginia"}
