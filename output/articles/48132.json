{"title":"Web feed","summary":"On the World Wide Web, a web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it by adding the feed resource address to a news aggregator client (also called a feed reader or a news reader). Users typically subscribe to a feed by manually entering the URL of a feed or clicking a link in a web browser or by dragging the link from the web browser to the aggregator, thus \"RSS and Atom files provide news updates from a website in a simple form for your computer.\"[1]","image":"Feed-icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Web_feed"}
