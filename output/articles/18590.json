{"title":"Gowanus Canal","summary":"The Gowanus Canal (originally known as the Gowanus Creek) is a 1.8-mile-long (2.9Â km) canal in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, on the westernmost portion of Long Island. Once a vital cargo transportation hub, the canal has seen decreasing use since the mid-20th century, parallel with the decline of domestic waterborne shipping.
