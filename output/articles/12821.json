{"title":"Dhumavati","summary":"Dhumavati (Sanskrit: धूमावती, Dhūmāvatī, literally \"the smoky one\") is one of the Mahavidyas, a group of ten Hindu Tantric goddesses. Dhumavati represents the fearsome aspect of Devi, the Hindu Divine Mother. She is often portrayed as an old, ugly widow, and is associated with things considered inauspicious and unattractive in Hinduism, such as the crow and the Chaturmas period. The goddess is often depicted on a horseless chariot or riding a crow, usually in a cremation ground.","image":"Goddess_Dhumavati%2C_One_of_the_Mahavidya_-_Vintage_Print_b.jpg.webp","url":"Dhumavati"}
