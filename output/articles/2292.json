{"title":"Aerobic organism","summary":"An aerobic organism or aerobe is an organism that can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment.[1] In contrast, an anaerobic organism (anaerobe) is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth. Some anaerobes react negatively or even die if oxygen is present.[2]  The ability to exhibit aerobic respiration may yield benefits to the aerobic organism, as aerobic respiration yields more energy than anaerobic respiration.[3] In July 2020, marine biologists reported that aerobic microorganisms (mainly), in \"quasi-suspended animation\", were found in organically-poor sediments, up to 101.5 million years old, 250 feet below the seafloor in the South Pacific Gyre (SPG) (\"the deadest spot in the ocean\"), and could be the longest-living life forms ever found.[4][5]","image":"Anaerobic.png.webp","url":"Aerobic_organism"}
