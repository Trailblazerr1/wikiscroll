{"title":"Constitutional amendment","summary":"A constitutional amendment is a modification of the constitution of a polity, organization or other type of entity. Amendments are often interwoven into the relevant sections of an existing constitution, directly altering the text. Conversely, they can be appended to the constitution as supplemental additions (codicils), thus changing the frame of government without altering the existing text of the document.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Constitutional_amendment"}
