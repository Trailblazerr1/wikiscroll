{"title":"Mandrill","summary":"The mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) is a primate of the Old World monkey (Cercopithecidae) family.[4] It is one of two species in the genus Mandrillus, along with the drill. Although they superficially resemble baboons, they are more closely related to mangabeys of the genus Cercocebus. Mandrills are found in southern Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of the Congo. Mandrills mostly live in tropical rainforest and in large groups. Mandrills have an omnivorous diet consisting mostly of fruits and insects. Their mating season peaks in July to September, with a corresponding birth peak in December to April.","image":"Mandrill_at_SF_Zoo.jpg.webp","url":"Mandrill"}
