{"title":"Vascular plant","summary":"Vascular plants (from Latin vasculum: duct), also known as Tracheophyta (the tracheophytes /trəˈkiːəfaɪts/, from Greek τραχεῖα ἀρτηρία trācheia artēria 'windpipe' + φυτά phutá 'plants'), form a large group of plants (c. 300,000 accepted known species)[5] that are defined as land plants with lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. They also have a specialized non-lignified tissue (the phloem) to conduct products of photosynthesis. Vascular plants include the clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, gymnosperms (including conifers) and angiosperms (flowering plants). Scientific names for the group include Tracheophyta,[6][4]: 251  Tracheobionta[7] and Equisetopsida sensu lato. Some early land plants (the rhyniophytes) had less developed vascular tissue; the term eutracheophyte has been used for all other vascular plants.","image":"Athyrium_filix-femina.jpg.webp"}
