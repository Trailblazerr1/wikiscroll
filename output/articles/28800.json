{"title":"Masculinity","summary":"Masculinity (also called manhood or manliness) is a set of attributes, behaviors, and roles associated with men and boys. Although sociologists think of masculinity as socially constructed,[1] there is also widespread recognition that some behaviors considered masculine are influenced by both cultural factors and biological factors.[1][2][3][4] To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.[2][3][4] It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex,[5][6] as both males and females can exhibit masculine traits.[7]","image":"0_Statue_de_Mars_(Pyrrhus)_-_Musei_Capitolini_-_MC0058_(2).JPG.webp"}
