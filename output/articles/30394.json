{"title":"Monocotyledon","summary":"Monocotyledons (/ˌmɒnəˌkɒtəlˈiːdən/),[lower-alpha 4][13][14] commonly referred to as monocots, (Lilianae sensu Chase & Reveal) are grass and grass-like flowering plants (angiosperms), the seeds of which typically contain only one embryonic leaf, or cotyledon. They constitute one of the major groups into which the flowering plants have traditionally been divided, the rest of the flowering plants having two cotyledons and therefore classified as dicotyledons, or dicots.","image":"Wheat_close-up.JPG.webp"}
