{"title":"Chinua Achebe","summary":"Chinua Achebe (/ˈtʃɪnwɑː əˈtʃɛbeɪ/; 16 November 1930 – 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as the dominant figure of modern African literature. His first novel and magnum opus, Things Fall Apart (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated and read African novel. Along with Things Fall Apart, his No Longer at Ease (1960) and Arrow of God (1964) complete the so called \"African Trilogy\"; later novels include A Man of the People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987). He is often referred to as the \"father of African literature\", although he vigorously rejected the characterization.","image":"Chinua_Achebe%2C_1966.jpg.webp"}
