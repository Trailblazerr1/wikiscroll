{"title":"Coriolis force","summary":"In physics, the Coriolis force is an inertial or fictitious force[1] that acts on objects that are in motion within a frame of reference that rotates with respect to an inertial frame. In a reference frame with clockwise rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. Deflection of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the Coriolis effect. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis, in connection with the theory of water wheels.[2] Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology.","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Coriolis_force"}
