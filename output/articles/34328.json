{"title":"Peloneustes","summary":"Peloneustes (meaning \"mud swimmer\") is a genus of pliosaurid plesiosaur from the Middle Jurassic of England. Its remains are known from the Peterborough Member of the Oxford Clay Formation, which is Callovian in age. It was originally described as a species of Plesiosaurus by palaeontologist Harry Govier Seeley in 1896, before being given its own genus by naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1889. While many species have been assigned to Peloneustes, P. philarchus is currently the only one still considered valid, with the others moved to different genera, considered nomina dubia, or synonymised with P. philarchus. Some of the material formerly assigned to P. evansi have since been reassigned to \"Pliosaurus\" andrewsi. Peloneustes is known from many specimens, including some very complete material.","image":"Peloneustes_philarchus_Tubingen.JPG.webp","url":"Peloneustes"}
