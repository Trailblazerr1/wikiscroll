{"title":"Federally Administered Tribal Areas","summary":"The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA; Pashto: فدرالي قبايلي سيمې‎; Urdu: وفاق کے زیر انتظام قبائلی علاقہ جات‎) was a semi-autonomous tribal region in northwestern Pakistan that existed from 1947 until being merged with neighbouring province Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018. It consisted of seven tribal agencies (districts) and six frontier regions, and were directly governed by Pakistan's federal government through a special set of laws called the Frontier Crimes Regulations. It bordered Pakistan's provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and Punjab to the east, south, and south-east respectively, and Afghanistan's provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktia, Khost and Paktika to the west and north. The territory is almost exclusively inhabited by the Pashtun, who also live in the neighbouring provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Northern Balochistan, and straddle across the border into Afghanistan. They are mostly Muslim.","image":"Flag_of_FATA.svg.png.webp","url":"Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas"}
