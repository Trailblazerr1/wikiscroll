{"title":"Canadian Alliance","summary":"The Canadian Alliance (French: Alliance canadienne), formally the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance (French: Alliance r√©formiste-conservatrice canadienne), was a centre-right to right-wing federal political party in Canada that existed from 2000 to 2003. The party was the successor to the Reform Party of Canada and inherited many of its populist policies, as well as its position as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons of Canada. The party supported policies that were both fiscally and socially conservative, seeking reduced government spending on social programs and reductions in taxation.","image":"Canadian_Alliance_logo_-_logo_de_l'Alliance_Canadienne.svg.png.webp"}
