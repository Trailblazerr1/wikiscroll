{"title":"Autopsy","summary":"An autopsy (post-mortem examination, obduction, necropsy, or autopsia cadaverum) is a surgical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a corpse by dissection to determine the cause, mode, and manner of death or to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present for research or educational purposes. (The term \"necropsy\" is generally reserved for non-human animals). Autopsies are usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.  In most cases, a medical examiner or coroner can determine cause of death and only a small portion of deaths require an autopsy.","image":"Rembrandt_-_The_Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr_Nicolaes_Tulp.jpg.webp"}
