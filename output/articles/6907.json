{"title":"Blepharoplasty","summary":"Blepharoplasty (Greek: blepharon, \"eyelid\" + plassein \"to form\") is the plastic surgery operation for correcting defects, deformities, and disfigurations of the eyelids; and for aesthetically modifying the eye region of the face. With the excision and the removal, or the repositioning (or both) of excess tissues, such as skin and adipocyte fat, and the reinforcement of the corresponding muscle and tendon tissues, the blepharoplasty procedure resolves functional and cosmetic problems of the periorbita, which is the area from the eyebrow to the upper portion of the cheek. The procedure is more common among women, who accounted for approximately 85% of blepharoplasty procedures in 2014 in the US and 88% of such procedures in the UK.[1][2]","image":"Upper_eyelid_blepharoplasty_incision.png.webp","url":"Blepharoplasty"}
