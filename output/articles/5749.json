{"title":"Bath Abbey","summary":"Bath Abbey is a parish church of the Church of England and former Benedictine monastery in Bath, Somerset, England.[3] Founded in the 7th century, it was reorganised in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries; major restoration work was carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s. It is one of the largest examples of Perpendicular Gothic architecture in the West Country. The medieval abbey church served as a sometime cathedral of a bishop. After long contention between churchmen in Bath and Wells the seat of the Diocese of Bath and Wells was later consolidated at Wells Cathedral.  The Benedictine community was dissolved in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.[4]","image":"Abad√≠a_de_Bath%2C_Bath%2C_Inglaterra%2C_2014-08-12%2C_DD_07.JPG.webp"}
