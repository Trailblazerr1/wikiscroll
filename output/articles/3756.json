{"title":"Ankylosauridae","summary":"Ankylosauridae (/ˌæŋkɪloʊˈsɔːrɪdiː/) is a family of armored dinosaurs within Ankylosauria, and is the sister group to Nodosauridae. The oldest known Ankylosaurids date to around 122 million years ago and went extinct 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.[1] These animals were mainly herbivorous and were obligate quadrupeds, with leaf-shaped teeth and robust, scute-covered bodies. Ankylosaurids possess a distinctly domed and short snout, wedge-shaped osteoderms on their skull, scutes along their torso, and a tail club.[2]","image":"Euoplocephalus_tutus_RTMP.jpg.webp"}
