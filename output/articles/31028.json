{"title":"Myoclonus","summary":"Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary, irregular (lacking rhythm) twitching (different from clonus, which is rhythmic/ regular) of a muscle or a group of muscles.  It describes a medical sign and, generally, is not a diagnosis of a disease.  These myoclonic twitches, jerks, or seizures are usually caused by sudden muscle contractions (positive myoclonus) or brief lapses of contraction (negative myoclonus).  The most common circumstance under which they occur is while falling asleep (hypnic jerk).  Myoclonic jerks occur in healthy people and are experienced occasionally by everyone.  However, when they appear with more persistence and become more widespread they can be a sign of various neurological disorders.  Hiccups are a kind of myoclonic jerk specifically affecting the diaphragm.  When a spasm is caused by another person it is known as a provoked spasm.  Shuddering attacks in babies fall in this category.","image":"Sleepingcatwhiskertwitches.gif"}
