{"title":"Morus (plant)","summary":"Morus, a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae, consists of diverse species of deciduous trees commonly known as mulberries, growing wild and under cultivation in many temperate world regions.[1][2][3] Generally, the genus has three well-known species ostensibly named for the fruit color of the best-known cultivar: white, red, and black mulberry (Morus alba, M. rubra, and M. nigra, respectively), with numerous cultivars,[4][5] The name \"white mulberry\" came about because the first specimens named by European taxonomists were a cultivated mutation prized for their white fruit, but wild trees bear black fruit like other mulberries. White mulberry is native to South Asia, but is widely distributed across Europe, Southern Africa, South America, and North America.[2] The species most preferred by the silkworm, Morus alba is regarded as an invasive species in Brazil and the United States.[2]","image":"Morus_alba_FrJPG.jpg.webp","url":"Morus_(plant)"}
