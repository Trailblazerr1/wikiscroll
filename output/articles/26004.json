{"title":"Levonorgestrel","summary":"Levonorgestrel is a hormonal medication which is used in a number of birth control methods.[5] It is combined with an estrogen to make combination birth control pills.[6] As an emergency birth control, sold under the brand name Plan B among others, it is useful within 72 hours. This should not be confused with EllaOne which can be effective within 120 hours (5 days) of unprotected sex.[5] The more time that has passed since sex, the less effective the medication becomes, and it does not work after pregnancy (implantation) has occurred.[5] It decreases the chances of pregnancy by 57 to 93%.[7] In an intrauterine device (IUD), such as Mirena among others, it is effective for the long-term prevention of pregnancy.[5] A levonorgestrel-releasing implant is also available in some countries.[8]","image":"Levonorgestrel.svg.png.webp"}
