{"title":"Ithkuil","summary":"Ithkuil is an experimental constructed language created by John Quijada.[1] It is designed to express deeper levels of human cognition briefly yet overtly and clearly, particularly with regard to human categorization. It is a cross between an a priori philosophical and a logical language. It tries to minimize the vagueness and semantic ambiguity found in natural human languages.[2] Ithkuil is notable for its grammatical complexity and extensive phoneme inventory, the latter being simplified in an upcoming redesign. The name \"Ithkuil\" is an anglicized form of Iţkuîl, which in the original form roughly means \"hypothetical representation of a language\".[2] Quijada states he did not create Ithkuil to be auxiliary or used in everyday conversations. He wanted the language to be used for more elaborate and profound fields where more insightful thoughts are expected, such as philosophy, arts, science and politics.[3]","image":"Ithkuil-name.svg.png.webp","url":"Ithkuil"}
