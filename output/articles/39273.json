{"title":"San Andreas Fault","summary":"The San Andreas Fault is a continental transform fault that extends roughly 1,200 kilometers (750 mi) through California.[1] It forms the tectonic boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, and its motion is right-lateral strike-slip (horizontal). The fault divides into three segments, each with different characteristics and a different degree of earthquake risk. The slip rate along the fault ranges from 20 to 35 mm (0.79 to 1.38 in)/yr.[1] It was formed by a transform boundary.","image":"Aerial-SanAndreas-CarrizoPlain.jpg.webp","url":"San_Andreas_Fault"}
