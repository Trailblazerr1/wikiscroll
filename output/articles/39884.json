{"title":"Secret sharing","summary":"Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) refers to methods for distributing a secret among a group of participants, each of whom is allocated a share of the secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number, of possibly different types, of shares are combined; individual shares are of no use on their own.","image":"a54c6f69626ac96acfe202a13039f3d432777be3.svg"}
