{"title":"Ico","summary":"Ico (イコ, Iko, /ˈiːkoʊ/) is an action-adventure game developed by Japan Studio and Team Ico, and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, released for the PlayStation 2 video game console in 2001 and 2002 in various regions. It was designed and directed by Fumito Ueda, who wanted to create a minimalist game around a \"boy meets girl\" concept. Originally planned for the PlayStation, Ico took approximately four years to develop. The team employed a \"subtracting design\" approach to reduce elements of gameplay that interfered with the game's setting and story in order to create a high level of immersion.","image":"Ico_cover_-_EU%2BJP.jpg.webp","url":"Ico"}
