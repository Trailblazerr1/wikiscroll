{"title":"Shalmaneser V","summary":"Shalmaneser V (Neo-Assyrian cuneiform: 𒀭𒁲𒈠𒉡𒈦 Salmānu-ašarēd,[2][3] meaning \"Salmānu is foremost\")[3] was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from the death of his father Tiglath-Pileser III in 727 BC to his deposition and death in 722 BC. Though Shalmaneser V's brief reign is poorly known from contemporary sources, he remains known for the conquest of Samaria and the fall of the Kingdom of Israel, though the conclusion of that campaign is sometimes attributed to his successor, Sargon II, instead.","image":"Shalmaneser_V_crown_prince.png.webp","url":"Shalmaneser_V"}
