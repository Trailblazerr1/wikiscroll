{"title":"Neoclassical economics","summary":"Neoclassical economics is an approach to economics in which the production, consumption and valuation (pricing) of goods and services are driven by the supply and demand model.[1][2] According to this line of thought, the value of a good or service is determined through a hypothetical maximization of utility by income-constrained individuals and of profits by firms facing production costs and employing available information and factors of production. This approach has often been justified by appealing to rational choice theory,[3] a theory that has come under considerable question in recent years.","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Neoclassical_economics"}
