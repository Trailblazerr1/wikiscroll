{"title":"Trump tariffs","summary":"The Trump tariffs are a series of United States tariffs imposed during the presidency of Donald Trump as part of his \"America First\" economic policy to reduce the United States trade deficit by shifting American trade policy from multilateral free trade agreements to bilateral trade deals. In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines of 30 to 50 percent.[1] In March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) from most countries,[2][3] which, according to Morgan Stanley, covered an estimated 4.1 percent of U.S. imports.[4] In June 2018, this was extended to the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.[3] The Trump administration separately set and escalated tariffs on goods imported from China, leading to a trade war.[5]","image":"Donald_Trump_official_portrait_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Trump_tariffs"}
