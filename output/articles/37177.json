{"title":"Rashidun","summary":"The Rashidun Caliphs (Arabic: الخلفاء الراشدون‎, romanized: al-Khulafāʾ al-Rāshidūn, lit. 'Rightly Guided Caliphs'), often simply called the Rashidun, are the first four caliphs (lit.: 'successors') who led the Muslim community following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad: Abu Bakr (r. 632–634), Umar (r. 634–644), Uthman (r. 644–656), and Ali (r. 656–661). The reign of these caliphs, called the Rashidun Caliphate (632–661), is considered in Sunni Islam to have been 'rightly guided' (Arabic: rāshid).","image":"تخطيط_كلمة_الخلفاء_الراشدون.png.webp","url":"Rashidun"}
