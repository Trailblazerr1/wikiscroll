{"title":"Asda","summary":"Asda Stores Ltd. (/ˈæzdə/) (often stylised as ASDA) is a British supermarket chain. It is headquartered in Leeds, England.[8] The company was founded in 1949 when the Asquith family merged their retail business with the Associated Dairies company of Yorkshire. It expanded into Southern England during the 1970s and 1980s, and acquired Allied Carpets, 61 large Gateway Supermarkets and other businesses, such as MFI Group. It sold these acquisitions during the 1990s to concentrate on the supermarkets. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange until 1999 when it was acquired by Walmart for £6.7 billion. Asda was the second-largest supermarket chain in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2014 by market share, at which point it fell into third place.[9][10]","image":"Asda_logo.svg.png.webp"}
