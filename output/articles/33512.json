{"title":"Ox","summary":"An ox (/ˈɒks/) (plural oxen, /ˈɒksən/), also known as a bullock (in BrE, AusE, and IndE),[1] is a male bovine trained and used as a draft animal. Oxen are commonly castrated adult male cattle; castration inhibits testosterone and aggression, which makes the males docile and safer to work with. Cows (adult females) or bulls (intact males) may also be used in some areas.","image":"India.Mumbai.04.jpg.webp"}
