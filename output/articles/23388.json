{"title":"Jilin","summary":"Jilin /dʒiːˈlɪn/[5] (吉林; alternately romanized as Kirin or Chilin) is one of the three provinces of Northeast China. Its capital and largest city is Changchun. Jilin borders North Korea (Rasŏn, North Hamgyong, Ryanggang and Chagang) and Russia (Primorsky Krai) to the east, Heilongjiang to the north, Liaoning to the south, and Inner Mongolia to the west. Along with the rest of Northeast China, Jilin underwent an early period of industrialization. However, Jilin's economy, characterized by heavy industry, has been facing economic difficulties with privatization. This prompted the central government to undertake a campaign called \"Revitalize the Northeast\". The region contains large deposits of oil shale.","image":"从长白山西坡看天池-2017-08-24_1.jpg.webp","url":"Jilin"}
