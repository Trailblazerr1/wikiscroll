{"title":"Essjay controversy","summary":"The Essjay controversy centered on Ryan Jordan, a Wikipedia editor who went by the username Essjay. On Wikipedia, he falsely presented himself as a university professor of religion. He was active from 2005 to 2008, and was elected to top positions of trust by the community, including the rank of administrator and arbitration committee member. In July 2006, The New Yorker published an article about \"Essjay\", and mentioned that he was a university professor of religion. The New Yorker later acknowledged it did not know his real name. The controversy came to involve Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales who, after initially defending Jordan, eventually asked for his resignation in March 2007.[1]","image":"Essjay.jpg.webp"}
