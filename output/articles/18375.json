{"title":"Golden Age of Porn","summary":"The term \"Golden Age of Porn\", or \"porno chic\", refers to a 15-year period (1969â€“1984) in commercial American pornography, in which sexually explicit films experienced positive attention from mainstream cinemas, movie critics, and the general public.[1][2] This American period, which had subsequently spread internationally,[3] and that began before the legalization of pornography in Denmark on July 1, 1969,[4] started on June 12, 1969 with the theatrical release of the film Blue Movie directed by Andy Warhol,[5][6][7] and, somewhat later, with the release of the 1970 film Mona produced by Bill Osco.[8][9] These films were the first adult erotic films depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States.[5][6][7][8] Both influenced the making of films such as 1972's Deep Throat starring Linda Lovelace and directed by Gerard Damiano,[10] Behind the Green Door starring Marilyn Chambers and directed by the Mitchell brothers,[11] 1973's The Devil in Miss Jones also by Damiano, and 1976's The Opening of Misty Beethoven by Radley Metzger. According to Warhol, Blue Movie was a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after Blue Movie was shown in theaters.[7]","image":"Deep_Throat_poster_2.jpg.webp"}
