{"title":"ANSI C","summary":"ANSI C, ISO C, and Standard C are successive standards for the C programming language published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  Historically, the names referred specifically to the original and best-supported version of the standard (known as C89 or C90).  Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so helps portability between compilers.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
