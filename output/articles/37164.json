{"title":"Rapping","summary":"Rapping (also rhyming, spitting,[1] emceeing[2] or MCing[2][3]) is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates \"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular\",[4] which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.[4] The components of rap include \"content\" (what is being said), \"flow\" (rhythm, rhyme), and \"delivery\" (cadence, tone).[5] Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off time to musical accompaniment.[6] Rap being a primary ingredient of hip hop music, it is commonly associated with that genre in particular; however, the origins of rap predate hip-hop culture by many years.","image":"50_cent_en_concierto.jpg.webp"}
