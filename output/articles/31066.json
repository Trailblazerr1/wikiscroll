{"title":"Māori King Movement","summary":"The Māori King Movement, called the Kīngitanga in Māori, is a movement that arose among some of the Māori tribes of New Zealand in the central North Island in the 1850s, to establish a role similar in status to that of the monarch of the British colonists, as a way of halting the alienation of Māori land.[1] The Māori monarch technically operates in a non-constitutional capacity with no legal or judicial power within the New Zealand government, but nonetheless, is an extremely influential political and cultural figure in the country for many of its 5.5 million people, wielding significant lobbying power and mana. Reigning monarchs retain the position of paramount chief of several iwi[2] and wield some power over these, especially within Tainui.","image":"King_Tuheitia_Paki_2009.jpg.webp","url":"Māori_King_Movement"}
