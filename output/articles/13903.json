{"title":"ECW One Night Stand (2006)","summary":"The 2006 ECW One Night Stand was the second annual One Night Stand professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held on June 11, 2006, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in the Manhattan borough of New York, New York. Like the previous year's event, although wrestlers from WWE's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions had appeared on the show, it was primarily held as a reunion show for wrestlers from the former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion, the assets of which WWE acquired in 2003. Just prior to the event, WWE also established a third brand dubbed ECW for wrestlers of the former promotion and newer talent. The event was in turn WWE's first PPV to feature the ECW brand.","image":"ECWonenightstand2006.jpg.webp","url":"ECW_One_Night_Stand_(2006)"}
