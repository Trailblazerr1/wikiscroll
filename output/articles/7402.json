{"title":"Bradycardia","summary":"Bradycardia in adults means their resting heart rate is under 60 beats per minute (BPM), although some studies use a heart rate of less than 50 BPM.[1] Bradycardia typically does not cause symptoms until the rate drops below 40 bpm. When symptomatic, it may cause fatigue, weakness, dizziness, sweating, and at very low rates, fainting.[2]","image":"Sinus_bradycardia_lead2.svg.png.webp","url":"Bradycardia"}
