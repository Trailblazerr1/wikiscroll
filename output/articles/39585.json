{"title":"Scat singing","summary":"In vocal jazz, scat singing is vocal improvisation with wordless vocables, nonsense syllables or without words at all.[2][3] In scat singing, the singer improvises melodies and rhythms using the voice as an instrument rather than a speaking medium.  This is different from vocalese, which uses recognizable lyrics that are sung to pre-existing instrumental solos.","image":"Ella_Fitzgerald_in_September_1947.jpg.webp"}
