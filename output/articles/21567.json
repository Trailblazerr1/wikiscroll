{"title":"Idealism","summary":"In philosophy, the term idealism identifies and describes metaphysical perspectives which assert that \"reality\" is indistinguishable and inseparable from human perception and understanding; that reality is a mental construct closely connected to ideas.[1] Idealist perspectives are in two categories: (i) Subjective idealism, which proposes that a material object exists only to the extent that a human being perceives the object; and (ii)  Objective idealism, which proposes the existence of an objective consciousness that exists prior to and independently of human consciousness, thus the existence of the object is independent of human perception.","image":"Plato_by_Raphael.png.webp","url":"Idealism"}
