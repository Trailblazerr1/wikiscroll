{"title":"Naxalite–Maoist insurgency","summary":"The Naxalite–Maoist insurgency, officially referred to as the Left Wing Extremism (LWE),[23] is an ongoing conflict[24] between Maoist groups known as Naxalites or Naxals; a group of far-left radical communists, supportive of Maoist political sentiment and ideology, and the Indian government. The influence zone of LWE is called the Red corridor, which has been steadily declining in terms of geographical coverage and number of violent incidents, and in 2021 it was confined to the 25 \"most affected\" locations (accounting for 85% of LWE violence) and 70 \"total affected\" districts (down from 180 in 2009)[25] across 10 states in two coal rich, remote, forested hilly clusters in and around the Dandakaranya-Chhattisgarh-Odisha region and the tri-junction area of Jharkhand-Bihar and-West Bengal.[23] The Naxalites have frequently targeted tribal, police and government workers in what they say is a fight for improved land rights and more jobs for neglected agricultural laborer and the poor.[26]","image":"Naxal_Left-wing_violence_or_activity_affected_districts_of_India_2018.svg.png.webp"}
