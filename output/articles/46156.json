{"title":"Turaco","summary":"The turacos make up the bird family Musophagidae (/ˌmjuːzoʊˈfædʒɪdiː/ \"banana-eaters\"), which includes plantain-eaters and go-away-birds. In southern Africa both turacos and go-away-birds are commonly known as loeries. They are semi-zygodactylous: the fourth (outer) toe can be switched back and forth. The second and third toes, which always point forward, are conjoined in some species. Musophagids often have prominent crests and long tails; the turacos are noted for peculiar and unique pigments giving them their bright green and red feathers.","image":"Tauraco_persa_(captive_-_Birds_of_Eden).jpg.webp"}
