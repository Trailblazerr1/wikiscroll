{"title":"Parable of the Good Samaritan","summary":"The parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.[Lk 10:25–37] It is about a traveler who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. First a Jewish priest and then a Levite comes by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan happens upon the traveler. Although Samaritans and Jews despised each other, the Samaritan helps the injured man. Jesus is described as telling the parable in response to the question from a lawyer, \"And who is my neighbor?\" The conclusion is that the neighbor figure in the parable is the one who shows mercy to the injured fellow man—that is, the Samaritan.","image":"Jordaens_Podhorce.jpg.webp","url":"Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan"}
