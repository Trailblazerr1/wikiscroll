{"title":"Iceland","summary":"Iceland (Icelandic: Ísland; [ˈistlant] (listen))[lower-alpha 4] is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean and the most sparsely populated country in Europe.[lower-alpha 5][13] The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is the only part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that rises above sea-level, and its central volcanic plateau is erupting almost constantly.[14][15] The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, and most of its islands have a polar climate.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
