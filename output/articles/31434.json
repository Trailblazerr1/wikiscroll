{"title":"National anthem of Russia","summary":"The \"State Anthem of the Russian Federation\"[lower-alpha 1] is the national anthem of Russia. It uses the same melody as the \"State Anthem of the Soviet Union\", composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who had collaborated with Gabriel El-Registan on the original anthem.[3]  From 1944, that earliest version replaced \"The Internationale\", as a new, more Soviet-centric, and Russia-centric Soviet anthem.  The same melody, but without any lyrics, was used after 1956.  A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism, and without mentioning the denounced Stalin by name.","image":"Russian_Anthem_Music_Sheet.InstrumentalSimple.svg.png.webp","url":"National_anthem_of_Russia"}
