{"title":"Unitarianism","summary":"Unitarianism (from Latin unitas \"unity, oneness\", from unus \"one\") is a nontrinitarian Christian theological movement that believes that the God in Christianity is one singular entity, as opposed to a Trinity (tri- from Latin tres \"three\"). Most other branches of Christianity define God as one being in three persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.[1] Unitarian Christians believe that Jesus was inspired by God in his moral teachings, and he is a savior,[2][3] but he was not a deity or God incarnate.","image":"P_religion_world.svg.png.webp","url":"Unitarianism"}
