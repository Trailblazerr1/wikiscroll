{"title":"Lingam","summary":"A lingam (Sanskrit: लिङ्ग IAST: liṅga, lit. \"sign, symbol or mark\"), sometimes referred to as linga or Shiva linga, is an abstract or aniconic representation of the Hindu god Shiva in Shaivism.[1] The original meaning of lingam as \"sign\" is used in Shvetashvatara Upanishad, which says \"Shiva, the Supreme Lord, has no liūga\", liuga (Sanskrit: लिūग IAST: liūga) meaning he is transcendent, beyond any characteristic and, specifically the sign of gender.[2][3] Lingam is an “outward symbol” of the “formless Reality”, the symbolization of merging of the form (Prakṛti)  with the formless Reality (Purusha) in transcendental context.[4] It is typically the primary murti or devotional image in Hindu temples dedicated to Shiva, also found in smaller shrines, or as self-manifested natural objects.[5][6] It is often represented within a disc-shaped platform.[1][7] It is usually shown with yoni – its feminine counterpart.[8][9] Together, they symbolize the merging of microcosmos and macrocosmos,[9] the divine eternal process of creation and regeneration, and the union of the feminine and the masculine that recreates all of existence.[10][11] The lingam is conceptualized both as an emblem of generative and destructive power,[10][12] particularly in the esoteric Kaula and Tantra practices, as well as the Shaivism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism.[13]","image":"Shiv_lingam_Tripundra.jpg.webp"}
