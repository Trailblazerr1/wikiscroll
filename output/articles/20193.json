{"title":"Hernia","summary":"A hernia is the abnormal exit of tissue or an organ, such as the bowel, through the wall of the cavity in which it normally resides.[1] Various types of hernias can occur,[6] most commonly involving the abdomen, and specifically the groin.[6] Groin hernias are most commonly of the inguinal type but may also be femoral.[1] Other types of hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias.[6] Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias.[1] This may include pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen, especially with coughing, exercise, or urinating or defecating.[1] Often, it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down.[1] A bulge may appear at the site of hernia, that becomes larger when bending down.[1] Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side.[1] The main concern is bowel strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked.[1] This usually produces severe pain and tenderness in the area.[1] Hiatus, or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain while eating.[3]","image":"Inguinalhernia.gif"}
