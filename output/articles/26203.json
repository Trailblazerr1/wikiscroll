{"title":"Limited liability","summary":"Limited liability is a legal status where a person's financial liability is limited to a fixed sum, most commonly the value of a person's investment in a corporation, company or partnership. If a company that provides limited liability to its investors is sued, then the claimants are generally entitled to collect only against the assets of the company, not the assets of its shareholders or other investors.[1][2]  A shareholder in a corporation or limited liability company is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any, except under special and rare circumstances permitting \"piercing the corporate veil.\"[3]  The same is true for the members of a limited liability partnership and the limited partners in a limited partnership.[4] By contrast, sole proprietors and partners in general partnerships are each liable for all the debts of the business (unlimited liability).","image":"Society.svg.png.webp","url":"Limited_liability"}
