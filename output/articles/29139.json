{"title":"Medes","summary":"The Medes /ˈmiːdz/[N 1] (Old Persian: 𐎶𐎠𐎭 Māda-; Akkadian: 𒆳𒈠𒁕𒀀𒀀 mat Mādāya, 𒆳𒈠𒋫𒀀𒀀 mat Mātāya;[2] Ancient Greek: Μῆδοι Mêdoi) were an ancient Iranian people[N 2] who spoke the Median language and who inhabited an area known as Media between western and northern Iran. Around the 11th century BC, they occupied the mountainous region of northwestern Iran and the northeastern and eastern region of Mesopotamia located in the region of Hamadan (Ecbatana). Their emergence in Iran is believed to have occurred during the 8th century BC. In the 7th century BC, all of western Iran and some other territories were under Median rule, but their precise geographic extent remains unknown.[4]","image":"Map_of_Assyria.png.webp","url":"Medes"}
