{"title":"Vim (text editor)","summary":"Vim (/vÉªm/;[5] a contraction of Vi IMproved) is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix. It is an improved clone of Bill Joy's vi. Vim's author, Bram Moolenaar, derived Vim from a port of the Stevie editor for Amiga[6] and released a version to the public in 1991. Vim is designed for use both from a command-line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is released under the Vim license that includes some charityware clauses, encouraging users who enjoy the software to consider donating to children in Uganda.[4] The Vim license is compatible with the GNU General Public License through a special clause allowing distribution of modified copies under the GNU GPL version 2.0 or later.[4]","image":"Vimlogo.svg.png.webp"}
