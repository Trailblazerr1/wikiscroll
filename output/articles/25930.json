{"title":"Leopold Stokowski","summary":"Leopold Anthony Stokowski (18 April 1882 â€“ 13 September 1977) was an English conductor. One of the leading conductors of the early and mid-20th century, he is best known for his long association with the Philadelphia Orchestra and his appearance in the Disney film Fantasia with that orchestra. He was especially noted for his free-hand conducting style that spurned the traditional baton and for obtaining a characteristically sumptuous sound from the orchestras he directed.[1]","image":"Leopold_Stokowski_LOC_26447u.jpg.webp"}
