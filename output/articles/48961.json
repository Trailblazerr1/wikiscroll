{"title":"Wreck diving","summary":"Wreck diving is recreational diving where the wreckage of ships, aircraft and other artificial structures are explored. Although most wreck dive sites are at shipwrecks, there is an increasing trend to scuttle retired ships to create artificial reef sites. Diving to crashed aircraft can also be considered wreck diving.[1] The recreation of wreck diving makes no distinction as to how the vessel ended up on the bottom.","image":"Diver_at_Hilma_Hooker_wreck.jpg.webp","url":"Wreck_diving"}
