{"title":"Arbroath","summary":"Arbroath (/ɑːrˈbroʊθ/) or Aberbrothock (Scottish Gaelic: Obar Bhrothaig[2] [ˈopəɾ ˈvɾo.ɪkʲ]) is a former royal burgh and the largest town in the council area of Angus, Scotland, with a population of 23,902.[3] It lies on the North Sea coast some 16 miles (25.7 km) ENE of Dundee and 45 miles (72.4 km) SSW of Aberdeen. There is evidence of Iron Age settlement, but its history as a town began with the founding of Arbroath Abbey in 1178. It grew much during the Industrial Revolution through the flax and then the jute industry and the engineering sector. A new harbour created in 1839; by the 20th century, Arbroath was one of Scotland's larger fishing ports. It is notable for the Declaration of Arbroath and the Arbroath smokie.[4] Arbroath Football Club holds the world record for the number of goals scored in a professional football match: 36–0 against Aberdeen Bon Accord in the Scottish Cup in 1885.","image":"Arbroath_from_Inchape_Park.JPG.webp","url":"Arbroath"}
