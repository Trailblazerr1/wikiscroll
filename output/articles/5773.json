{"title":"Battery cage","summary":"Battery cages are a housing system used for various animal production methods, but primarily for egg-laying hens.  The name arises from the arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, in a unit, as in an artillery battery. Although the term is usually applied to poultry farming, similar cage systems are used for other animals. Battery cages have generated controversy between advocates for animal welfare and industrial producers.","image":"Battery-farm.jpg.webp"}
