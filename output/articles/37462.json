{"title":"Reform Judaism","summary":"Reform Judaism (also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) is a major Jewish denomination that emphasizes the evolving nature of the faith, the superiority of its ethical aspects to its ceremonial ones, and belief in a continuous revelation, which is closely intertwined with human reason and not limited to the theophany at Mount Sinai. A liberal strand of Judaism, it is characterized by lessened stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and great openness to external influences and progressive values.","image":"Congregation_Emanu-El_of_the_City_New_York.jpg.webp"}
