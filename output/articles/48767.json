{"title":"Wireless device radiation and health","summary":"The antennas contained in mobile phones, including smartphones, emit radiofrequency (RF) radiation (non-ionizing \"radio waves\" such as microwaves); the parts of the head or body nearest to the antenna can absorb this energy and convert it to heat. Since at least the 1990s, scientists have researched whether the now-ubiquitous radiation associated with mobile phone antennas or cell phone towers is affecting human health.[1] Mobile phone networks use various bands of RF frequency, some of which overlap with the microwave range. Other digital wireless systems, such as data communication networks, produce similar radiation.","image":"Man_speaking_on_mobile_phone.jpg.webp","url":"Wireless_device_radiation_and_health"}
