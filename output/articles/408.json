{"title":"2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans","summary":"On Monday, August 29, 2005, there were over 50 failures of the levees and flood walls protecting New Orleans, Louisiana, and its suburbs following passage of Hurricane Katrina and landfall in Mississippi.  The levee and flood wall failures caused flooding in 80% of New Orleans and all of St. Bernard Parish.  Tens of billions of gallons of water spilled into vast areas of New Orleans, flooding over 100,000 homes and businesses.  Responsibility for the design and construction of the levee system belongs to the United States Army Corps of Engineers; the responsibility of maintenance belongs to the local levee boards.  The Corps hands components of the system over to the local levee boards upon completion.  When Katrina struck on August 29, 2005, the project was between 60â€“90% complete. [1] Four major investigations were conducted by civil engineers and other experts in an attempt to identify the underlying reasons for the failure of the federal flood protection system. All concur that the primary cause of the flooding was inadequate design and construction by the Army Corps of Engineers. [2]","image":"Katrina-noaaGOES12.jpg.webp"}
