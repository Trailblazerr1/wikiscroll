{"title":"Oryzomys antillarum","summary":"Oryzomys antillarum, also known as the Jamaican rice rat,[7] is an extinct rodent of Jamaica. A member of the genus Oryzomys within the family Cricetidae, it is similar to O. couesi of mainland Central America, from where it may have dispersed to its island during the last glacial period. O. antillarum is common in subfossil cave faunas and is also known from three specimens collected live in the 19th century. Some historical records of Jamaican rats may pertain to it. The species probably became extinct late in the 19th century, perhaps due to the introduction of the small Asian mongoose, competition with introduced rodents such as the brown rat, and habitat destruction.","image":"Oryzomys_antillarum_Ray.png.webp","url":"Oryzomys_antillarum"}
