{"title":"India–Bangladesh enclaves","summary":"The India–Bangladesh enclaves, also known as the chiṭmahals (Bengali: ছিটমহল chiṭmôhôl[1][2][3][4]) and sometimes called pasha enclaves,[5] were the enclaves along the Bangladesh–India border, in Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya. Within the main body of Bangladesh were 102 enclaves of Indian territory, which in turn contained 21 Bangladeshi counter-enclaves, one of which contained Dahala Khagrabari–an Indian counter-counter-enclave–the world's only third-order enclave when it existed. Within the Indian mainland were 71 Bangladeshi enclaves, containing 3 Indian counter-enclaves. A joint census in 2010 found 51,549 people residing in these enclaves: 37,334 in Indian enclaves within Bangladesh and 14,215 in Bangladeshi enclaves within India.[3][6]","image":"Cooch-behar-enclaves-schematisch.png.webp"}
