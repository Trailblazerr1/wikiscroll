{"title":"Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine","summary":"Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH; 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, НДМГ or codenamed Geptil) is a chemical compound with the formula H2NN(CH3)2 that is used as a rocket propellant. It is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammonia-like smell typical for organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is miscible with water, ethanol, and kerosene. In concentration between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock.  Symmetrical dimethylhydrazine, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine is also known but is not as useful.[4]","image":"1%2C1-Dimethylhydrazin2.svg.png.webp","url":"Unsymmetrical_dimethylhydrazine"}
