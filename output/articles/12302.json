{"title":"De-extinction","summary":"De-extinction (also known as resurrection biology, or species revivalism) is the process of generating an organism that either resembles or is an extinct species.[1] There are several ways to carry out the process of de-extinction. Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although genome editing and selective breeding have also been considered. Similar techniques have been applied to certain endangered species, in hopes to boost their genetic diversity. The only method of the three that would provide an animal with the same genetic identity is cloning.[2] There are both pros and cons to the process of de-extinction ranging from technological advancements to ethical issues.","image":"Pyrenean_Ibex.png.webp","url":"De-extinction"}
