{"title":"Pressure ulcer","summary":"Pressure ulcers, also known as pressure sores or bed sores, are localised damage to the skin and/or underlying tissue that usually occur over a bony prominence as a result of usually long-term pressure, or pressure in combination with shear or friction. The most common sites are the skin overlying the sacrum, coccyx, heels, and hips, though other sites can be affected, such as the elbows, knees, ankles, back of shoulders, or the back of the cranium.","image":"Decubitus_ulcer_stage_4.jpg.webp","url":"Pressure_ulcer"}
