{"title":"Domicile (law)","summary":"Domicile is relevant to an individual's \"personal law,\" which includes the law that governs a person's status and their property. It is independent of a person's nationality. Although a domicile may change from time to time, a person has only one domicile, or residence, at any point in their life, no matter what their circumstances.[1] Domicile is distinct from habitual residence, where there is less focus on future intent.","image":"Wikisource-logo.svg.png.webp"}
