It was first described by Irish naturalist William Ogilby in 1833. Its 13 subspecies are grouped under two varieties: the common or ellipsiprymnus waterbuck and the defassa waterbuck.  The head-and-body length is typically between 177 and 235 cm (70 and 93 in) and the  typical height is between 120 and 136 cm (47 and 54 in). A sexually dimorphic antelope, males are taller and heavier than females. Males reach roughly 127 cm (50 in) at the shoulder, while females reach 119 cm (47 in). Males typically weigh 198–262 kg (437–578 lb) and females 161–214 kg (355–472 lb). Their coat colour varies from brown to grey. The long, spiral horns, present only on males, curve backward, then forward, and are 55–99 cm (22–39 in) long.","image":"Ugandan_defassa_waterbuck_(Kobus_ellipsiprymnus_defassa)_male.jpg.webp"}
