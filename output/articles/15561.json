{"title":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation","summary":"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), also known as extracorporeal life support (ECLS), is an extracorporeal technique of providing prolonged cardiac and respiratory support to persons whose heart and lungs are unable to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or perfusion to sustain life. The technology for ECMO is largely derived from cardiopulmonary bypass, which provides shorter-term support with arrested native circulation.  The device used is a membrane oxygenator, also known as an artificial lung.","image":"Veno-arterial_(VA)_ECMO_for_cardiac_or_respiratory_failure.jpg.webp","url":"Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation"}
