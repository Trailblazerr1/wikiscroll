Biden, the vice president of the United States from 2009 to 2017 and a former U.S. senator from Delaware, had been the subject of widespread speculation as a potential 2020 candidate after declining to be a candidate in the 2016 election, which saw Donald Trump winning over Hillary Clinton, who was supported by Biden.[12]","image":"Biden_Harris_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign"}
