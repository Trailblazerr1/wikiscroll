{"title":"Extended periodic table","summary":"An extended periodic table theorises about chemical elements beyond those currently known in the periodic table and proven, up to oganesson, which completes the seventh period (row) in the periodic table at atomic number (Z) 118. As of 2021, no element with a higher atomic number than oganesson has been successfully synthesized; all elements in the eighth period and beyond thus remain purely hypothetical.","image":"Pyykko_periodic_table_172.svg.png.webp"}
