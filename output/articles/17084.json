{"title":"Friedreich's ataxia","summary":"Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA or FA) is an autosomal-recessive genetic disease that causes difficulty walking, a loss of sensation in the arms and legs, and impaired speech that worsens over time. Symptoms generally start between 5 and 20 years of age. Many develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and require a mobility aid such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair in their teens.   As the disease progresses, some affected people lose their sight and hearing. Other complications may include scoliosis and diabetes mellitus.","image":"Protein_FXN_PDB_1ekg.png.webp"}
