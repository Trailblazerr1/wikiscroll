{"title":"Sharia","summary":"Sharia (/ʃəˈriːə/; Arabic: شريعة‎, romanized: sharīʿa [ʃaˈriːʕa]) is a religious law forming part of the Islamic tradition.[1][2][3] It's derived from the religious precepts of Islam and is based on the interpretations of the sacred scriptures of Islam, particularly the Quran and the Hadith.[1] In Arabic, the term sharīʿah refers to God's immutable divine law and is contrasted with fiqh, which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.[4][5][6] The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim fundamentalists and modernists.[7][2]","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp","url":"Sharia"}
