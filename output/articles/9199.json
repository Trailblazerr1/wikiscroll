{"title":"Chamber of Deputies (Italy)","summary":"The Chamber of Deputies (Italian: Camera dei deputati) is the lower house of the bicameral Parliament of Italy (the other being the Senate of the Republic). The two houses together form a perfect bicameral system, meaning they perform identical functions, but do so separately. The Chamber of Deputies has 630 members. Pursuant to the amended article 56 of the Italian Constitution, the Chamber of Deputies will have 400 seats following the next election, of which 392 will be elected from Italian constituencies, and 8 from Italian citizens living abroad. Deputies are styled The Honourable (Italian: Onorevole)[1] and meet at Palazzo Montecitorio.","image":"Chamber_of_Deputies_of_Italy_-_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Chamber_of_Deputies_(Italy)"}
