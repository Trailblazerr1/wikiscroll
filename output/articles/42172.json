{"title":"Status epilepticus","summary":"Status epilepticus (SE) is a single seizure lasting more than 5 minutes or two or more seizures within a five-minute period without the person returning to normal between them.[3][1] Previous definitions used a 30-minute time limit.[2] The seizures can be of the tonicâ€“clonic type, with a regular pattern of contraction and extension of the arms and legs, or of types that do not involve contractions, such as absence seizures or complex partial seizures.[1] Status epilepticus is a life-threatening medical emergency, particularly if treatment is delayed.[1]","image":"Spike-waves.png.webp","url":"Status_epilepticus"}
