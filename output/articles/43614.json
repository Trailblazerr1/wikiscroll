{"title":"Telomere","summary":"A telomere (/ˈtɛləmɪər/ or /ˈtiːləmɪər/, from Ancient Greek: τέλος, romanized: télos, lit. 'end' and Ancient Greek: μέρος, romanized: méros, lit. 'part') is a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences associated with specialized proteins at the ends of linear chromosomes. Although there are different architectures, telomeres, in a broad sense, are a widespread genetic feature most commonly found in eukaryotes. In  most, if not all species possessing them, they protect the terminal regions of chromosomal DNA from progressive degradation and ensure the integrity of linear chromosomes by preventing DNA repair systems from mistaking the very ends of the DNA strand for a double strand break.","image":"Telomere_caps.gif"}
