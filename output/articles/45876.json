{"title":"Tree of the knowledge of good and evil","summary":"The tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Tiberian Hebrew: עֵ֕ץ הַדַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָרָֽע; ʿêṣ had-daʿaṯ ṭōḇ wā-rāʿ, [ʕesˤ hadaʕaθ tˤov wɔrɔʕ]) is one of two specific trees in the story of the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2–3, along with the tree of life. Alternatively, some scholars have argued that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is just another name for the tree of life.[1]","image":"Lucas_Cranach_(I)_-_Adam_and_Eve-Paradise_-_Kunsthistorisches_Museum_-_Detail_Tree_of_Knowledge.jpg.webp"}
