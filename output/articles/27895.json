{"title":"Macrolide","summary":"The macrolides are a class of natural products that consist of a large macrocyclic lactone ring to which one or more deoxy sugars, usually cladinose and desosamine, may be attached. The lactone rings are usually 14-, 15-, or 16-membered. Macrolides belong to the polyketide class of natural products. Some macrolides have antibiotic or antifungal activity and are used as pharmaceutical drugs.\nMacrolides are bacteriostatic in that they suppress or inhibit bacterial growth rather than killing bacteria completely.","image":"Erythromycin_A.svg.png.webp"}
