{"title":"Persistent vegetative state","summary":"A persistent vegetative state (PVS) or post-coma unresponsiveness[1] (PCU) is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. After four weeks in a vegetative state (VS), the patient is classified as in a persistent vegetative state. This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. The term unresponsive wakefulness syndrome may be alternatively used,[2] as \"vegetative state\" has some negative connotations among the public.[3]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Persistent_vegetative_state"}
