{"title":"Brioni Agreement","summary":"The Brioni Agreement, also known as the Brioni Declaration (Croatian: Brijunska deklaracija, Serbian: Brionska deklaracija, Serbian Cyrillic: Брионска декларација, Slovene: Brionska deklaracija), is a document signed by representatives of Slovenia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia under the political sponsorship of the European Community (EC) on the Brijuni Islands on 7 July 1991. The agreement sought to create an environment in which further negotiations on the future of Yugoslavia could take place. However, ultimately it isolated the federal prime minister Ante Marković in his efforts to preserve Yugoslavia, and effectively stopped any form of federal influence over Slovenia. This meant the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) would focus on combat in Croatia, creating a precedent of redrawing international borders and staking the EC's interest in resolving the Yugoslav crisis.","image":"Slovenia_Croatia_and_Yugoslavia_location_map.svg.png.webp","url":"Brioni_Agreement"}
