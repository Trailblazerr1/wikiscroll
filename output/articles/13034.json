{"title":"Dimorphodon","summary":"Dimorphodon /daɪˈmɔːrfədɒn/ was a genus of medium-sized pterosaur from the early Jurassic Period. It was named by paleontologist Richard Owen in 1859. Dimorphodon means \"two-form tooth\", derived from the Greek δι (di) meaning \"two\", μορφη (morphe) meaning \"shape\" and οδων (odon) meaning \"tooth\", referring to the fact that it had two distinct types of teeth in its jaws – which is comparatively rare among reptiles. Dimorphodon inhabited Europe.","image":"Dimorphodon_Flight_Pose.png.webp","url":"Dimorphodon"}
