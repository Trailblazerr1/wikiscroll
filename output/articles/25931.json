{"title":"Leopold and Loeb","summary":"Nathan Freudenthal Leopold Jr. (November 19, 1904 – August 29, 1971)[1] and Richard Albert Loeb (/ˈloʊb/; June 11, 1905 – January 28, 1936), usually referred to collectively as Leopold and Loeb, were two wealthy students at the University of Chicago who in May 1924 kidnapped and murdered 14-year-old Bobby Franks in Chicago, Illinois. They committed the murder—characterized at the time as \"the crime of the century\"[2]—as a demonstration of their ostensible intellectual superiority,[3] which they believed enabled and entitled them to carry out a \"perfect crime\" without consequences.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-00652%2C_Nathan_Leopold.png.webp"}
