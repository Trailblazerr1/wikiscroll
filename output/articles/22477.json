{"title":"Irreducible complexity","summary":"Irreducible complexity (IC) is the argument that certain biological systems cannot have evolved by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through natural selection, because no less complex system would function. Irreducible complexity has become central to the creationist concept of intelligent design, but the scientific community[1] regards intelligent design as pseudoscience and rejects the concept of irreducible complexity.[2] Irreducible complexity is one of two main arguments used by intelligent-design proponents, alongside specified complexity.[3]","image":"Watch_with_no_background.png.webp","url":"Irreducible_complexity"}
