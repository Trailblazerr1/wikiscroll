{"title":"Crank (mechanism)","summary":"A crank is an arm attached at a right angle to a rotating shaft by which circular motion is imparted to or received from the shaft. When combined with a connecting rod, it can be used to convert circular motion into reciprocating motion, or vice versa. The arm may be a bent portion of the shaft, or a separate arm or disk attached to it.  Attached to the end of the crank by a pivot is a rod, usually called a connecting rod (conrod).","image":"Winch.PNG.webp","url":"Crank_(mechanism)"}
