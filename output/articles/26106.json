{"title":"Life-support system","summary":"A life-support system is the combination of equipment that allows survival in an environment or situation that would not support that life in its absence. It is generally applied to systems supporting human life in situations where the outside environment is hostile, such as in space or underwater, or medical situations where the health of the person is compromised to the extent that the risk of death would be high without the function of the equipment.","image":"Sputnik_asm.jpg.webp","url":"Life-support_system"}
