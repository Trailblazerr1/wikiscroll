{"title":"Territorial evolution of Canada","summary":"The history of post-confederation Canada began on July 1, 1867, when the British North American colonies of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia were united to form a single Dominion within the British Empire.[1] Upon Confederation, the United Province of Canada was immediately split into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.[2] The colonies of Prince Edward Island and British Columbia joined shortly after, and Canada acquired the vast expanse of the continent controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company, which was eventually divided into new territories and provinces.[3] Canada evolved into a fully sovereign state by 1982.[4]","image":"Fathers_of_Confederation_LAC_c001855.jpg.webp"}
