{"title":"Lagrange's theorem (group theory)","summary":"Lagrange's theorem, in group theory, a part of mathematics, states that for any finite group G, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of G divides the order of G. The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange.  The following variant states that for a subgroup \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n of a finite group \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n, not only \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        G\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          |\n        \n        H\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |G|/|H|}\n  \n is an integer, but also that its value is the index \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        G\n        :\n        H\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [G:H]}\n  \n, defined as the number of left cosets of \n  \n    \n      \n        H\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H}\n  \n in \n  \n    \n      \n        G\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle G}\n  \n.","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg"}
