{"title":"Lagrange's theorem (group theory)","summary":"Lagrange's theorem, in group theory, a part of mathematics, states that for any finite group G, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup of G divides the order of G. The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange.  The following variant states that for a subgroup H {\\displaystyle H} of a finite group G {\\displaystyle G} , not only | G | / | H | {\\displaystyle |G|/|H|} is an integer, but also that its value is the index [ G : H ] {\\displaystyle [G:H]} , defined as the number of left cosets of H {\\displaystyle H} in G {\\displaystyle G} .","image":"75a9edddcca2f782014371f75dca39d7e13a9c1b.svg","url":"Lagrange's_theorem_(group_theory)"}
