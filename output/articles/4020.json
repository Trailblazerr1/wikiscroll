{"title":"Anubis","summary":"Anubis or Inpu, Anpu in Ancient Egyptian (/əˈnjuːbɪs/;[2] Ancient Greek: Ἄνουβις, Egyptian: inpw, Coptic: ⲁⲛⲟⲩⲡ Anoup) is the Greek name of the god of death, mummification, embalming, the afterlife, cemeteries, tombs, and the Underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head. Archeologists have identified Anubis's sacred animal as an Egyptian canid, the African golden wolf. The African wolf was formerly called the \"African golden jackal\", until a 2015 genetic analysis updated the taxonomy and the common name for the species.[3][4][5] As a result, Anubis is often referred to as having a \"jackal\" head, but this \"jackal\" is now more properly called a \"wolf\".","image":"Anubis_standing.svg.png.webp"}
