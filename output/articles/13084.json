It is the replacement for Microsoft's earlier Video for Windows technology.[1]  Based on the Microsoft Windows Component Object Model (COM) framework, DirectShow provides a common interface for media across various programming languages, and is an extensible, filter-based framework that can render or record media files on demand at the request of the user or developer. The DirectShow development tools and documentation were originally distributed as part of the DirectX SDK.[2] Currently, they are distributed as part of the Windows SDK (formerly known as the Platform SDK).[3]","image":"Dxmlogomsmall.png.webp","url":"DirectShow"}
