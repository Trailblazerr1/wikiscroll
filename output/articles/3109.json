{"title":"Altitude sickness","summary":"Altitude sickness, the mildest form being acute mountain sickness (AMS), is the harmful effect of high altitude, caused by rapid exposure to low amounts of oxygen at high elevation.[1][2] People can respond to high altitude in different ways. Symptoms may include headaches, vomiting, tiredness, confusion, trouble sleeping, and dizziness.[1] Acute mountain sickness can progress to high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) with associated shortness of breath or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) with associated confusion.[1][2] Chronic mountain sickness may occur after long-term exposure to high altitude.[2]","image":"Altitude_Sickness_Warning.jpg.webp"}
