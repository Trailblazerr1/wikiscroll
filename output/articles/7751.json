{"title":"Bruise","summary":"A bruise, also known as a contusion, is a type of hematoma of tissue,[3] the most common cause being capillaries damaged by trauma, causing localized bleeding that extravasates into the surrounding interstitial tissues. Most bruises are not very deep under the skin so that the bleeding causes a visible discoloration. The bruise then remains visible until the blood is either absorbed by tissues or cleared by immune system action. Bruises which do not blanch under pressure can involve capillaries at the level of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone.[4][5] Bruises are not to be confused with other similar-looking lesions. (Such lesions include petechia (less than 3 mm (0.12 in), resulting from numerous and diverse etiologies such as adverse reactions from medications such as warfarin, straining, asphyxiation, platelet disorders and diseases such as cytomegalovirus),[6] purpura (3–100 mm (0.12–3.94 in), classified as palpable purpura or non-palpable purpura and indicates various pathologic conditions such as thrombocytopenia),[7]  and ecchymosis (more than 1 cm (0.39 in), caused by blood dissecting through tissue planes and settled in an area remote from the site of trauma or pathology such as periorbital ecchymosis, e.g. \"raccoon eyes\", arising from a basilar skull fracture or from a neuroblastoma).[8])","image":"Pferdekuss.jpg.webp","url":"Bruise"}
