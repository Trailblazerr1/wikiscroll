{"title":"GNU Project","summary":"The GNU Project (/ɡnuː/ (listen))[3] is a free software, mass collaboration project that Richard Stallman announced on September 27, 1983. Its goal is to give computer users freedom and control in their use of their computers and computing devices by collaboratively developing and publishing software that gives everyone the rights to freely run the software, copy and distribute it, study it, and modify it. GNU software grants these rights in its license.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
