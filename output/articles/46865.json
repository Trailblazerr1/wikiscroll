{"title":"Untermensch","summary":"Untermensch (German pronunciation: [ˈʔʊntɐˌmɛnʃ] (listen), underman, sub-man, subhuman; plural: Untermenschen) is a Nazi term for non-Aryan \"inferior people\" often referred to as \"the masses from the East\", that is Jews, Roma, and Slavs (Poles, Serbs and later also Russians).[1][2] The term was also applied to Mulatto and Black people.[3] Jewish, Polish and Romani people, along with the physically and mentally disabled, were to be exterminated[4] in the Holocaust.[5][6] According to the Generalplan Ost, the Slavic population of East-Central Europe was to be reduced in part through mass murder in the Holocaust, with a majority expelled to Asia and used as slave labor in the Reich. These concepts were an important part of the Nazi racial policy.[7]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
