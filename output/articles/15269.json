{"title":"Euclidean space","summary":"Euclidean space is the fundamental space of classical geometry. Originally, it was the three-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry, but in modern mathematics there are Euclidean spaces of any nonnegative integer dimension,[1] including the three-dimensional space and the Euclidean plane (dimension two). It was introduced by the Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria,[2] and the qualifier Euclidean is used to distinguish it from other spaces that were later discovered in physics and modern mathematics.","image":"Coord_system_CA_0.svg.png.webp"}
