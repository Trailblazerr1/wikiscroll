{"title":"1804 Haiti massacre","summary":"The 1804 Haiti massacre was carried out against the French population and French Creoles (or Franco-Haitians) remaining in Haiti following the Haitian Revolution,[1] by soldiers, mostly former slaves, under orders from Jean-Jacques Dessalines. He had decreed that all suspected of conspiring in the acts of the expelled army should be put to death.[2] From early January 1804 until 22 April 1804, squads of soldiers moved from house to house throughout Haiti, torturing and killing entire families.[3] Between 3,000 and 5,000 people were killed.[4]","image":"Manuel_Lopez_Lopez_-_Fue_muerta_y_destroiada_nel_campo_esta_infelir_p._haver_resistido_alos_deseos_brutales_de_los_negros_y_el_ni√±o_pererio_de_hambre_asulado_buscando_el_becho_yerto_desu_madre.jpg.webp","url":"1804_Haiti_massacre"}
