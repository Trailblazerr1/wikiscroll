{"title":"Anarcho-primitivism","summary":"Anarcho-primitivism is a political ideology that advocates a return to non-\"civilized\" ways of life through deindustrialization, abolition of the division of labor or specialization and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies. Anarcho-primitivists critique the origins and progress of the Industrial Revolution and industrial society.[1] According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence during the Neolithic Revolution gave rise to coercion, social alienation and social stratification.[2][3]","image":"Anarchy-symbol.svg.png.webp"}
