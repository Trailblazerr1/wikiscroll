{"title":"Amphicoelias","summary":"Amphicoelias (/ˌæmfɪˈsiːliəs/, meaning \"biconcave\", from the Greek ἀμφί, amphi: \"on both sides\", and κοῖλος, koilos: \"hollow, concave\") is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that lived approximately 150 million years ago during the Tithonian (Late Jurassic Period) of what is now Colorado, United States. A herbivore, Amphicoelias was moderately sized at about 25 m (82 ft) long–roughly the same length as Diplodocus, to which it was related. Its hindlimbs were very long and thin, and its forelimbs were proportionally longer than in relatives.","image":"Amphicoelias_Holotype_Vertebra.jpg.webp"}
