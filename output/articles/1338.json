{"title":"Metaphysics","summary":"Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that studies the first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, causality, necessity and possibility.[1] It includes questions about the nature of consciousness and the relationship between mind and matter. The word \"metaphysics\" comes from two Greek words that, together, literally mean \"after or behind or among [the study of] the natural\". It has been suggested that the term might have been coined by a first century CE editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle’s works into the treatise we now know by the name Metaphysics (μετὰ τὰ φυσικά, meta ta physika, lit. 'after the Physics ', another of Aristotle's works).[2]","image":"Philbar_3.png.webp"}
