{"title":"Lord Privy Seal","summary":"The Lord Privy Seal (or, more formally, the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal) is the fifth of the Great Officers of State in the United Kingdom, ranking beneath the Lord President of the Council and above the Lord Great Chamberlain. Originally, its holder was responsible for the monarch's personal (privy) seal (as opposed to the Great Seal of the Realm, which is in the care of the Lord Chancellor) until the use of such a seal became obsolete. The office is currently one of the traditional sinecure offices of state or may be referred to as Minister without Portfolio. Today, the holder of the office is invariably given a seat in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.","image":"Royal_Coat_of_Arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(HM_Government).svg.png.webp"}
