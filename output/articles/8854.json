{"title":"Casuistry","summary":"Casuistry (/ˈkæzjuɪstri/ KAZ-yoo-is-tree) is a process of reasoning that seeks to resolve moral problems by extracting or extending theoretical rules from a particular case, and reapplying those rules to new instances.[1] This method occurs in applied ethics and jurisprudence. The term is also commonly used as a pejorative to criticize the use of clever but unsound reasoning, especially in relation to moral questions (as in sophistry).[2]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp"}
