{"title":"27 Club","summary":"The 27 Club is a list consisting mostly of popular musicians, artists, or actors who died at age 27. Although the claim of a \"statistical spike\" for the death of musicians at that age has been repeatedly disproven by research, it remains a cultural phenomenon, documenting the deaths of celebrities, some noted for their high-risk lifestyles. Names are often put forward for inclusion, but because the club is entirely notional, there is no official membership.","image":"Graffiti_Tel_Aviv%2C_Khayim_Ben_Atar_St_-_zoom.jpg.webp","url":"27_Club"}
