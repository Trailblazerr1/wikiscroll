{"title":"Legitimacy (family law)","summary":"Legitimacy, in traditional Western common law, is the status of a child born to parents who are legally married to each other, and of a child conceived before the parents obtain a legal divorce. Conversely, illegitimacy  (or bastardy) has been the status of a child born outside marriage, such a child being known as a bastard, a love child, a natural child, or illegitimate, when such a child has been differentiated from other children.","image":"Elizabeth_I_Unknown_Artist.jpg.webp"}
