{"title":"Crêpe","summary":"A crêpe or crepe (/kreɪp/ (listen)[1] or /krɛp/, French: [kʁɛp] (listen), Quebec French: [kʁaɪ̯p] (listen)) is a type of very thin pancake. Crêpes originated in Brittany (a region in the west of France) during the 13th century,[2] but are now consumed around the world. Crêpes are usually one of two varieties: sweet crêpes (crêpes sucrées) or savoury galettes (crêpes salées). They are often served with a wide variety of fillings such as jam, Nutella, berries, spinach, and chicken.[3] Crêpes can also be flambéed, such as in crêpes Suzette.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
