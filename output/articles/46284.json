{"title":"Type II supernova","summary":"A Type II supernova (plural: supernovae or supernovas) results from the rapid collapse and violent explosion of a massive star. A star must have at least 8 times, but no more than 40 to 50 times, the mass of the Sun (M☉) to undergo this type of explosion.[1] Type II supernovae are distinguished from other types of supernovae by the presence of hydrogen in their spectra. They are usually observed in the spiral arms of galaxies and in H II regions, but not in elliptical galaxies; those are generally composed of older low-mass stars, with few of the young highly massive stars necessary to cause a supernova.","image":"HST_SN_1987A_20th_anniversary.jpg.webp"}
