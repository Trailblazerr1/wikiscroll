{"title":"Mouth ulcer","summary":"A mouth ulcer (aphtha) is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity.[1] Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal may be a sign of oral cancer. These ulcers may form individually or multiple ulcers may appear at once (i.e., a \"crop\" of ulcers). Once formed, an ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection.","image":"Aphthe_Unterlippe.jpg.webp"}
