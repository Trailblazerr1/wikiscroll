{"title":"Chola dynasty","summary":"The Chola dynasty was a Tamil thalassocratic empire of southern India, one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the world's history. The earliest datable references to the Chola[3][4][5] are in inscriptions from the 3rd century BCE left by Ashoka, of the Maurya Empire (Ashoka Major Rock Edict No.13). As one of the Three Crowned Kings of Tamilakam, along with the Chera and Pandya, the dynasty continued to govern over varying territory until the 13th century CE.  Despite these ancient origins, the period when it is appropriate to speak of a \"Chola Empire\" only begins with the medieval Cholas in the mid-9th century CE.","image":"Chola_flag.png.webp"}
