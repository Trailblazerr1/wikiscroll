{"title":"Thomson's gazelle","summary":"Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii) is one of the best-known gazelles. It is named after explorer Joseph Thomson and is sometimes referred to as a \"tommie\".[2] It is considered by some to be a subspecies of the red-fronted gazelle and was formerly considered a member of the genus Gazella within the subgenus Eudorcas, before Eudorcas was elevated to genus status.[3] Thomson's gazelles can be found in numbers exceeding 200,000[1] in Africa and are recognized as the most common type of gazelle in East Africa. The Thomson's gazelle can reach speeds of 80–90 km/h (50–55 mph). It is the fourth-fastest land animal, after the cheetah (its main predator), pronghorn, and springbok.[2]","image":"2009-thom-gazelle.jpg.webp","url":"Thomson's_gazelle"}
