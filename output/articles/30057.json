{"title":"Minneapolis–Saint Paul","summary":"Minneapolis–Saint Paul is a metropolitan area built around the confluence of the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota.[6] The area, historically a major railroad and flour milling center, is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the most populous city in the state and home of the largest university in the state, and Saint Paul, the state capital, which directly borders Minneapolis to the east. It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as \"the Cities\".","image":"2008-0712-MPLS-pan00-mp-edit.JPG.webp"}
