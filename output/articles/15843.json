{"title":"Fasting","summary":"Fasting is the willful refrainment from eating and sometimes drinking (see Water fasting and Juice fasting). From a purely physiological context, \"fasting\" may refer to the metabolic status of a person who has not eaten overnight (see the \"Breakfast\"), or to the metabolic state achieved after complete digestion and absorption of a meal.[1] Several metabolic adjustments occur during fasting. Some diagnostic tests are used to determine a fasting state. For example, a person is assumed to be fasting once 8–12 hours have elapsed since the last meal. Metabolic changes of the fasting state begin after absorption of a meal (typically 3–5 hours after eating). Of all the types of fisting, fasting after a day is considered the safest. Such cyclicity most accurately corresponds to the biological rhythm of a person, does not allow you to get very hungry, and then overeat. The body works in a comfortable mode all the time, because the glycogen reserves in the liver are normal.","image":"EmaciatedBuddha.JPG.webp","url":"Fasting"}
