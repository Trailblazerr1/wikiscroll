{"title":"Animator","summary":"An animator is an artist who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence.  Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games.  Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depend on the animators' artistic styles and their field.","image":"Norman_McLaren_drawing_on_film_-_1944.jpg.webp","url":"Animator"}
