{"title":"Cauchy stress tensor","summary":"In continuum mechanics, the Cauchy stress tensor σ {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\sigma }}} , true stress tensor,[1] or simply called the stress tensor is a second order tensor named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy.  The tensor consists of nine components σ i j {\\displaystyle \\sigma _{ij}} that completely define the state of stress at a point inside a material in the deformed state, placement, or configuration. The tensor relates a unit-length direction vector n to the traction vector T(n) across an imaginary surface perpendicular to n:","image":"e45fe1b9d8dcbc3103fc7805d69798bfe5ca5b16.svg","url":"Cauchy_stress_tensor"}
