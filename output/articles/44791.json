{"title":"The finger","summary":"In Western culture, \"the finger\", the middle finger (as in giving someone the (middle) finger, the bird[1] or flipping someone off)[1] or the rude finger is an obscene hand gesture. The gesture communicates moderate to extreme contempt, and is roughly equivalent in meaning to \"fuck me\", \"fuck you\", \"shove it up your ass/arse\", \"up yours\" or \"go fuck yourself\". It is performed by showing the back of a hand that has only the middle finger extended upwards, though in some locales, the thumb is extended. Extending the finger is considered a symbol of contempt in several cultures, especially in the Western world. Many cultures use similar gestures to display their disrespect, although others use it to express pointing without intentional disrespect. The gesture is usually used to express contempt but can also be used humorously or playfully.","image":"Givingthefinger.jpg.webp"}
