{"title":"Tongva","summary":"The Tongva (/ˈtɒŋvə/ TONG-və) are an indigenous people of California from the Los Angeles Basin and the Southern Channel Islands, an area covering approximately 4,000 square miles (10,000 km2).[1][2] In the precolonial era, the people lived in as many as 100 villages and primarily identified by their village name rather than by a pan-tribal name.[3] During colonization, the people were referred to as Gabrieleño and Fernandeño,[lower-alpha 1] names derived from the Spanish missions built on their land: Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission San Fernando Rey de España.[lower-alpha 2] The name Tongva is the most widely circulated name and gained popularity in the late 20th century. Others choose to identify as Kizh and disagree over use of the term Tongva.[4]","image":"Tongva_woman.jpg.webp","url":"Tongva"}
