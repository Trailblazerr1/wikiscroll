{"title":"Niqāb","summary":"A niqāb or niqaab (/nɪˈkɑːb/; Arabic: نِقاب‎ niqāb, \"[face] veil\"), also called a ruband, is a garment that covers the face, worn by some Muslim women as a part of an interpretation of hijab (modest dress). The terms niqab and burqa are often confused; a niqab covers the face while leaving the eyes uncovered, while a burqa covers the entire body from the top of the head to the ground, with only a mesh screen allowing the wearer to see in front of her. According to the majority of Muslim scholars and Islamic schools of thought, face veiling is not a requirement of Islam; however a minority of Muslim scholars, particularly among the Sunni Salafi and Wahhabism movement, assert that women are required to cover their faces in public. Those Muslim women who wear the niqab, do so in places where they may encounter non-mahram (un-related) men.","image":"Muslim_woman_in_Yemen.jpg.webp"}
