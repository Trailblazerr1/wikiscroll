{"title":"Omarska camp","summary":"The Omarska camp was a concentration camp[2][3] run by Bosnian Serb forces in the mining town of Omarska, near Prijedor in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina, set up for Bosniak and Croat men and women during the Prijedor massacre. Functioning in the first months of the Bosnian War in 1992, it was one of 677 alleged detention centers and camps set up throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war.[4] While nominally an \"investigation center\" or \"assembly point\" for members of the Bosniak and Croatian population,[5] Human Rights Watch classified Omarska as a concentration camp.[6][7]","image":"Bosnia_and_Herzegovina_location_map.svg.png.webp"}
