{"title":"Peroxisome","summary":"A peroxisome (IPA: [pɛɜˈɹɒksɪˌsoʊm]) [1] is a membrane-bound organelle (formerly known as a microbody), found in the cytoplasm of virtually all eukaryotic cells.[2] Peroxisomes are oxidative organelles. Frequently, molecular oxygen serves as a co-substrate, from which hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is then formed. Peroxisomes owe their name to hydrogen peroxide generating and scavenging activities. They perform key roles in lipid metabolism and the conversion of reactive oxygen species. Peroxisomes are involved in the catabolism of very long chain fatty acids, branched chain fatty acids, bile acid intermediates (in the liver), D-amino acids, and polyamines, the reduction of reactive oxygen species – specifically hydrogen peroxide[3] – and the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, i.e., ether phospholipids critical for the normal function of mammalian brains and lungs.[4] They also contain approximately 10% of the total activity of two enzymes (Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) in the pentose phosphate pathway,[5] which is important for energy metabolism.[4] It is vigorously debated whether peroxisomes are involved in isoprenoid and cholesterol synthesis in animals.[4] Other known peroxisomal functions include the glyoxylate cycle in germinating seeds (\"glyoxysomes\"), photorespiration in leaves,[6] glycolysis in trypanosomes (\"glycosomes\"), and methanol and/or amine oxidation and assimilation in some yeasts.","image":"Peroxisome.svg.png.webp"}
