{"title":"Pina Bausch","summary":"Philippine \"Pina\" Bausch[1][2][3][4][lower-alpha 1] (27 July 1940 â€“ 30 June 2009)  was a German dancer and choreographer who was a significant contributor to a neo-expressionist dance tradition now known as Tanztheater. Bausch's approach was noted for a stylized blend of dance movement, prominent sound design, and involved stage sets, as well as for engaging the dancers under her to help in the development of a piece, and her work had an influence on modern dance from the 1970's forward.[5] Her work, regarded as a continuation of the European and American expressionist movements, incorporated many expressly dramatic elements and often explored themes connected to trauma, particularly trauma arising out of relationships.[6] She created the company Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, which performs internationally.","image":"Pina_Bausch.jpg.webp"}
