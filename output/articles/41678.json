{"title":"Spectre (security vulnerability)","summary":"Spectre is a class of security vulnerabilities that affects modern microprocessors that perform branch prediction and other forms of speculation.[1][2][3]\nOn most processors, the speculative execution resulting from a branch misprediction may leave observable side effects that may reveal private data to attackers. For example, if the pattern of memory accesses performed by such speculative execution depends on private data, the resulting state of the data cache constitutes a side channel through which an attacker may be able to extract information about the private data using a timing attack.[4][5][6]","image":"Spectre_logo_with_text.svg.png.webp"}
