{"title":"Pruitt–Igoe","summary":"The Wendell O. Pruitt Homes and William Igoe Apartments, known together as Pruitt–Igoe (/ˈpruɪt ˈaɪɡoʊ/), were joint urban housing projects first occupied in 1954[1] in the US city of St. Louis, Missouri. Living conditions in Pruitt–Igoe began to decline soon after completion in 1956.[2] By the late 1960s, the complex had become internationally infamous for its poverty, crime and racial segregation. The 11-story high rises within the complex almost exclusively accommodated African-Americans.[3] All 33 buildings were demolished with explosives in the mid-1970s,[4] and the project has come to represent some of the failures of urban renewal, public-policy planning and public housing.","image":"Pruitt-Igoe-overview.jpg.webp","url":"Pruitt–Igoe"}
