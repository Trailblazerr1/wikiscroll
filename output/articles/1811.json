{"title":"A Song Flung Up to Heaven","summary":"A Song Flung Up to Heaven is the sixth book in author Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies.  Set between 1965 and 1968, it begins where Angelou's previous book All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes ends, with Angelou's trip from Accra, Ghana, where she had lived for the past four years, back to the United States.  Two \"calamitous events\"[1] frame the beginning and end of the bookâ€”the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr.  Angelou describes how she dealt with these events and the sweeping changes in both the country and in her personal life, and how she coped with her return home to the U.S.  The book ends with Angelou at \"the threshold of her literary career\",[2] writing the opening lines to her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.","image":"A_Song_Flung_Up_to_Heaven.jpg.webp","url":"A_Song_Flung_Up_to_Heaven"}
