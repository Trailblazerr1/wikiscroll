{"title":"Innervisions","summary":"Innervisions is the sixteenth studio album by American singer, songwriter and musician Stevie Wonder, released August 3, 1973, on the Tamla label for Motown Records, a landmark recording of his \"classic period\".[3] It is also regarded as Wonder's transition from Little Stevie Wonder and romantic ballads to a more musically mature, conscious and grown-up artist.[4] With Wonder being the first major artist to experiment with the revolutionary TONTO (The Original New Timbral Orchestra) synth, developed by Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff, and the ARP synthesizer on a large scale, Innervisions became hugely influential on the subsequent future of commercial soul and black music.","image":"Steviewonder_innervisions.jpg.webp"}
