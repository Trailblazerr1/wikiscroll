{"title":"Painted turtle","summary":"The painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) is the most widespread native turtle of North America. It lives in slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The turtle is the only extant species of the genus Chrysemys, which is part of the pond turtle family Emydidae. Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15Â million years ago. Four regionally based subspecies (the eastern, midland, southern, and western) evolved during the last ice age.","image":"Painted_Turtle_(14541060047).jpg.webp","url":"Painted_turtle"}
