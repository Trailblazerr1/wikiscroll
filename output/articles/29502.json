{"title":"Metaphysical poets","summary":"The term Metaphysical poets was coined by the critic Samuel Johnson to describe a loose group of 17th-century English poets whose work was characterised by the inventive use of conceits, and by a greater emphasis on the spoken rather than lyrical quality of their verse. These poets were not formally affiliated and few were highly regarded until 20th century attention established their importance.","image":"Abraham_Cowley_by_Sir_Peter_Lely.jpg.webp","url":"Metaphysical_poets"}
