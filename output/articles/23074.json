{"title":"Japanese verb conjugation","summary":"As with most languages, Japanese verbs can be phonetically modified to change the purpose, nuance or meaning of the verb. These modifications are known as \"verb conjugations\". In the Japanese language, the beginning of a word is usually preserved during conjugations (this is the \"verb stem\"), whilst the ending of the word is altered in some way to change the meaning (this is the \"inflectional suffix\"). Unlike many other languages, Japanese verb conjugations are independent from a subject's perspective (e.g. the first/second/third person), gender (e.g. feminine/masculine/neutral) and plurality (e.g. singular/plural).","image":"page1-220px-AMB_Japanese_Verbs.pdf.jpg.webp","url":"Japanese_verb_conjugation"}
