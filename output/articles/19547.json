{"title":"Hanging Gardens of Babylon","summary":"The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World listed by Hellenic culture. They were described as a remarkable feat of engineering with an ascending series of tiered gardens containing a wide variety of trees, shrubs, and vines, resembling a large green mountain constructed of mud bricks. It was said to have been built in the ancient city of Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq. The Hanging Gardens' name is derived from the Greek word κρεμαστός (kremastós, lit. 'overhanging'), which has a broader meaning than the modern English word \"hanging\" and refers to trees being planted on a raised structure such as a terrace.[1][2][3]","image":"Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon.jpg.webp"}
