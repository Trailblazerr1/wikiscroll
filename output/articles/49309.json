{"title":"Young's modulus","summary":"Young's modulus E {\\displaystyle E} , the Young modulus, or the modulus of elasticity in tension or compression (i.e., negative tension), is a mechanical property that measures the tensile or compressive stiffness of a solid material when the force is applied lengthwise. It quantifies the relationship between tensile/compressive stress σ {\\displaystyle \\sigma } (force per unit area) and axial strain ε {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon } (proportional deformation) in the linear elastic region of a material and is determined using the formula:[1]","image":"4232c9de2ee3eec0a9c0a19b15ab92daa6223f9b.svg","url":"Young's_modulus"}
