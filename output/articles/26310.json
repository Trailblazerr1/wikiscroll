{"title":"Lips Are Movin","summary":"\"Lips Are Movin\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor, taken from her major-label debut studio album Title (2015). It was written by Trainor and its producer, Kevin Kadish. Epic Records premiered the song on MTV News on October 15, 2014, and released it to United States contemporary hit radio stations on October 21, as the second single from Title. A retro-tinged doo-wop and pop song with girl-group harmonies and bubblegum pop hooks, \"Lips Are Movin\" was inspired by Trainor's conflict with her record label. However, critical commentary has described it as a song about Trainor leaving her significant other after discovering he is cheating on her.","image":"Meghan_Trainor_-_Lips_Are_Movin.png.webp","url":"Lips_Are_Movin"}
