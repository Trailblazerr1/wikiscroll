{"title":"Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation","summary":"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is one of two agencies that supply  deposit insurance to depositors in American depository institutions, the other being the National Credit Union Administration, which regulates and insures credit unions. The FDIC is a United States government corporation supplying deposit insurance to depositors in American commercial banks and savings banks.[3]: 15  The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act, enacted during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system. More than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[3]: 15 [4] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category, and this was increased several times over the years. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US$250,000 per ownership category.[5] FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States of America, and since its start in 1933 no depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured funds.[6][7]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation.svg.png.webp","url":"Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation"}
