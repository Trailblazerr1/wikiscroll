{"title":"Narbonne","summary":"Narbonne (/nɑːrˈbɒn/, also US: /-ˈbɔːn, -ˈbʌn/,[3][4][5] French: [naʁbɔn]; Occitan: Narbona [naɾˈbunɔ]; Latin: Narbo [ˈna(ː)rboː]; Late Latin: Narbona) is a commune in southern France in the Occitanie region. It lies 849 km (528 mi) from Paris in the Aude department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. It is located about 15 km (9 mi) from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and was historically a prosperous port, but declined from the 14th century following a change in the course of the river Aude. It is marginally the largest commune in Aude, although it is not the capital of the Aude department of the smaller commune of Carcassonne.","image":"Montage_photo_narbonne.jpg.webp"}
