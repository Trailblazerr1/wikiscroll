{"title":"Solubility equilibrium","summary":"Solubility equilibrium is a type of dynamic equilibrium that exists when a chemical compound in the solid state is in chemical equilibrium with a solution of that compound. The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solution, such as acid or alkali. Each solubility equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent solubility product which functions like an  equilibrium constant. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.","image":"1365354655ab371c4a4fd969406f7d53db50a9ed.svg"}
