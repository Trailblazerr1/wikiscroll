{"title":"Cigarette Smoking Man","summary":"The Cigarette Smoking Man (abbreviated CSM or C-Man; sometimes referred to as Cancer Man or the Smoking Man) is a fictional character and one of the primary antagonists of the American science fiction drama television series The X-Files. He serves as the arch-nemesis of FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder. In the show's sixth season, his name is said to be C.G.B. Spender, but Dana Scully suggests this is one of \"hundreds of aliases\"; the show's characters and fans continue to refer to him by variations of \"the Smoking Man\" because he is almost always seen chain-smoking Morley cigarettes. In the eleventh season, he reveals his full name to be Carl Gerhard Busch.","image":"The_Smoking_Man_(X-Files).jpg.webp","url":"Cigarette_Smoking_Man"}
