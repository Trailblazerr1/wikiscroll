{"title":"50000 Quaoar","summary":"Quaoar (50000 Quaoar), provisional designation 2002 LM60, is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy planetesimals beyond Neptune. A non-resonant object (cubewano), it measures approximately 1,121 km (697 mi) in diameter, about half the diameter of Pluto. The object was discovered by American astronomers Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown at the Palomar Observatory on 4 June 2002.[1] Signs of water ice on the surface of Quaoar have been found, which suggests that cryovolcanism may be occurring on Quaoar.[21] A small amount of methane is present on its surface, which can only be retained by the largest Kuiper belt objects.[22] In February 2007, Weywot, a synchronous moon in orbit around Quaoar, was discovered by Brown.[7] Weywot is measured to be 170 km (110 mi) across.[23] Both objects were named after mythological figures from the Native American Tongva people in Southern California. Quaoar is the Tongva creator deity and Weywot is his son.[2]","image":"Quaoar_symbol_(Moskowitz%2C_fixed_width).svg.png.webp"}
