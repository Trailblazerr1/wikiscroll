{"title":"Goofy","summary":"Goofy is a cartoon character created by The Walt Disney Company. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic animal[3] who typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. He is normally characterized as hopelessly clumsy and dim-witted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way.","image":"Goofy_Duckipedia.png.webp"}
