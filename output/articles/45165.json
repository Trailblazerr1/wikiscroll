{"title":"Tik Tok (song)","summary":"\"Tik Tok\" (stylized as \"TiK ToK\" and pronounced as \"tick tock\") is the debut solo single by American singer Kesha. She co-wrote the song with its producers Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. It was released on August 7, 2009, as the lead single from Kesha's debut studio album, Animal. The opening line of the song came from an experience where Kesha woke up surrounded by beautiful women, to which she imagined P. Diddy being in a similar scenario. The experience prompted the writing of the song which she later brought to her producer, Dr. Luke, who was then contacted by P. Diddy in hopes of a collaboration; he came to the studio the same day and recorded his lines and the song was completed. According to Kesha, the song's lyrics are representative of her and based on her life; the song has a carefree message and talks about not letting anything bring you down.","image":"TiK_ToK_-_Kesha_(official_single_cover).JPG.webp","url":"Tik_Tok_(song)"}
