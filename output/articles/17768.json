{"title":"George C. Marshall","summary":"George Catlett Marshall Jr. GCB (December 31, 1880 â€“ October 16, 1959) was an American soldier and statesman. He rose through the United States Army to become Chief of Staff under presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, then served as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense under Truman.[4] Winston Churchill lauded Marshall as the \"organizer of victory\" for his leadership of the Allied victory in World War II. After the war, he spent a frustrating year trying and failing to avoid the impending civil war in China. As Secretary of State, Marshall advocated a U.S. economic and political commitment to post-war European recovery, including the Marshall Plan that bore his name. In recognition of this work, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.[5]","image":"George_Catlett_Marshall%2C_general_of_the_US_army_(cropped)(b).jpg.webp","url":"George_C._Marshall"}
