{"title":"Battle of Fontenoy","summary":"The Battle of Fontenoy was a major engagement of the War of the Austrian Succession, fought on 11 May 1745, 8 kilometres (5.0Â mi) outside Tournai, Belgium. A French army of 50,000 under Marshal Saxe defeated a Pragmatic Army [lower-alpha 1] of 52,000, led by the Duke of Cumberland. Along with his son the Dauphin, Louis XV of France was present and thus technically in command, a fact later used to bolster the regime's prestige.","image":"Battle_of_Fontenoy_1745.PNG.webp","url":"Battle_of_Fontenoy"}
