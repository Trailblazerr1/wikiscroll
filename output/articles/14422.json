{"title":"Electric multiple unit","summary":"An electric multiple unit or EMU is a multiple-unit train consisting of self-propelled carriages using electricity as the motive power. An EMU requires no separate locomotive, as electric traction motors are incorporated within one or a number of the carriages. An EMU is usually formed of two or more semi-permanently coupled carriages, but electrically powered single-unit railcars are also generally classed as EMUs. The great majority of EMUs are passenger trains, but versions also exist for carrying mail.","image":"Liverpool_Overhead_Railway_carriage%2C_Museum_of_Liverpool-2.jpg.webp","url":"Electric_multiple_unit"}
