{"title":"Thabo Mbeki","summary":"Thabo Mvuyelwa Mbeki[3] (Xhosa pronunciation: [tʰaɓɔ mbɛːkʼi]; born 18 June 1942) is a South African politician who served as the second president of post-apartheid South Africa, from 16 June 1999[4] to 24 September 2008.[5] On 20 September 2008, with about nine months left in his second term, Mbeki announced his resignation after being recalled by the National Executive Committee of the ANC,[6] following a conclusion by judge C. R. Nicholson of improper interference in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), including the prosecution of Jacob Zuma for corruption.[7] On 12 January 2009, the Supreme Court of Appeal unanimously overturned judge Nicholson's judgement[8][9][10] but the resignation stood.","image":"Thabo_Mbeki_2003.jpg.webp","url":"Thabo_Mbeki"}
