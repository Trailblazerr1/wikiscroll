{"title":"Modernism","summary":"Modernism is both a philosophical movement and an art movement that arose from broad transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The movement reflected a desire for the creation of new forms of art,  philosophy, and social organization which reflected the newly emerging industrial world, including features such as urbanization, new technologies, and war. Artists attempted to depart from traditional forms of art, which they considered outdated or obsolete. The poet Ezra Pound's 1934 injunction to \"Make it New\" was the touchstone of the movement's approach.","image":"Les_Demoiselles_d'Avignon.jpg.webp","url":"Modernism"}
