{"title":"Rope","summary":"A rope is a group of yarns, plies, fibers or strands that are twisted or braided together into a larger and stronger form. Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, string, and twine.","image":"Hawser-laid_rope_(Seaman's_Pocket-Book%2C_1943).jpg.webp","url":"Rope"}
