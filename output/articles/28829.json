{"title":"Mass shooting","summary":"There is a lack of consensus on how to define a mass shooting. Most terms define a minimum of three or four deaths due to gun violence (not including the shooter), although an Australian study from 2006 prescribed  a minimum of five; and added a requirement that the victims actually died as opposed to being shot and injured but not necessarily killed.[1]","image":"Total_deaths_in_US_mass_shootings.png.webp"}
