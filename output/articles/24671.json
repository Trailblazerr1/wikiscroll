{"title":"Kevlar","summary":"Kevlar (para-aramid)[2] is a heat-resistant and strong synthetic fiber, related to other aramids such as Nomex and Technora. Developed by Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont in 1965,[3][2][4] the high-strength material was first used commercially in the early 1970s as a replacement for steel in racing tires. It is typically spun into ropes or fabric sheets that can be used as such, or as an ingredient in composite material components.","image":"Kevlar-3D-balls.png.webp"}
