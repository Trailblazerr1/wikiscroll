{"title":"Pretzel","summary":"A pretzel (listen ), from dialectal German pronunciation, standard German: Breze(l) (listen  and French / Alsatian: Bretzel) is a type of baked pastry made from dough that is commonly shaped into a knot. The traditional pretzel shape is a distinctive symmetrical form, with the ends of a long strip of dough intertwined and then twisted back onto itself in a particular way (a pretzel loop or pretzel bow). Today, pretzels come in a wide range of shapes.","image":"BrezelnSalz02_(cropped).JPG.webp","url":"Pretzel"}
