{"title":"Einherjar","summary":"In Norse mythology, the einherjar (Old Norse: [ˈɛinˌherjɑz̠], literally \"army of one\", \"those who fight alone\"[1][2]) are those who have died in battle and are brought to Valhalla by valkyries. In Valhalla, the einherjar eat their fill of the nightly-resurrecting beast Sæhrímnir, and valkyries bring them mead (which comes from the udder of the goat Heiðrún). The einherjar prepare daily for the events of Ragnarök, when they will advance for an immense battle at the field of Vígríðr.","image":"Walhall_by_Emil_Doepler.jpg.webp","url":"Einherjar"}
