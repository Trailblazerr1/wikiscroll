{"title":"Bonobo","summary":"The bonobo (/bəˈnoʊboʊ, ˈbɒnəboʊ/; Pan paniscus) is an endangered great ape. It is one of the two species making up the genus Pan, the other being the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes).[3] While bonobos are now recognized as a distinct species in their own right, they were initially thought to be a subspecies of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) due to the physical similarities between the two species. Taxonomically, the members of the chimpanzee/bonobo subtribe Panina (composed entirely by the genus Pan) are collectively termed panins.[4][5]","image":"Apeldoorn_Apenheul_zoo_Bonobo.jpg.webp"}
