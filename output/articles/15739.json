Falun Gong has its global headquarters in Dragon Springs, a 400-acre (160 ha) compound around Cuddebackville in Deerpark, New York, near the current residence of Li Hongzhi. Falun Gong's performance arts extension, Shen Yun (\"Divine Rhythm\") and two closely connected schools, Fei Tian (\"Flying Sky-Being\") College and Fei Tian Academy of the Arts, also operate in and around Dragon Springs.[4][5][6]","image":"Falun_Gong_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
