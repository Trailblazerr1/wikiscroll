{"title":"Workers' Party (Brazil)","summary":"The Workers' Party (Portuguese: Partido dos Trabalhadores, PT) is a political party in Brazil. Some scholars classify its ideology in the 21st century as social democracy, with the party shifting from a broadly socialist ideology in the 1990s.[2] Founded in 1980, it is the largest left-wing party in Latin America.[15][16] PT governed at the federal level in a coalition government with several other parties from 1 January 2003 to 31 August 2016. After the 2002 parliamentary election, PT became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies and the largest in the Federal Senate for the first time[17] With the highest approval rating in the history of the country, former President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva is PT's most prominent member.[18] His successor Dilma Rousseff, also a member of PT, took office on 1 January 2011 and was impeached in 2016.","image":"PT_(Brazil)_logo_2021.svg.png.webp"}
