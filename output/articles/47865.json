{"title":"Walschaerts valve gear","summary":"The Walschaerts valve gear is a type of valve gear invented by Belgian railway mechanical engineer Egide Walschaerts in 1844 used to regulate the flow of steam to the pistons in Steam locomotives. The gear is sometimes named without the final \"s\", since it was incorrectly patented under that name. It was extensively used in steam locomotives from the late 19th century until the end of the steam era.","image":"60163_Tornado_motion.jpg.webp"}
