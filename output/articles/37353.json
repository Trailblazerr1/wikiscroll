{"title":"Rectus abdominis muscle","summary":"The rectus abdominis muscle, also known as the \"abdominal muscle\" or simply the \"abs\", is a paired muscle running vertically on each side of the anterior wall of the human abdomen, as well as that of some other mammals. There are two parallel muscles, separated by a midline band of connective tissue called the linea alba. It extends from the pubic symphysis, pubic crest and pubic tubercle inferiorly, to the xiphoid process and costal cartilages of ribs V to VII superiorly.[1]  The proximal attachments are the pubic crest and the pubic symphysis.  It attaches distally at the costal cartilages of ribs 5-7 and the xiphoid process of the sternum.[2]","image":"Rectus_abdominis.png.webp","url":"Rectus_abdominis_muscle"}
