{"title":"Juniper berry","summary":"A juniper berry is the female seed cone produced by the various species of junipers.  It is not a true berry but a cone with unusually fleshy and merged scales, which gives it a berry-like appearance. The cones from a handful of species, especially Juniperus communis, are used as a spice, particularly in European cuisine, and also give gin its distinctive flavour. Juniper berries are among the only spices derived from conifers,[1] along with spruce buds.[2]","image":"Juniperus_communis_fruits_-_Keila.jpg.webp"}
