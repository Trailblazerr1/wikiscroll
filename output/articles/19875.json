{"title":"Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)","summary":"\"Heartbreaker\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released on September 21, 1999, by Columbia Records as the lead single from Carey's seventh studio album Rainbow (1999). The song was written by Carey and Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter, and produced by Carey and DJ Clue. Additional writers are credited, since the song's hook is built around a sample from \"Attack of the Name Game\" by Stacy Lattisaw. \"Heartbreaker\" pushed Carey even further into the R&B and hip hop market, becoming her second commercial single to feature a rapper. Lyrically, the song talks about a relationship from the female perspective, and how the protagonist incessantly returns to her lover, even though he continuously cheats on her and breaks her heart.","image":"Heartbreaker_(single)_Mariah_Carey.png.webp","url":"Heartbreaker_(Mariah_Carey_song)"}
