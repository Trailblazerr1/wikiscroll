{"title":"Æthelbald, King of Wessex","summary":"Æthelbald (died 860) was King of Wessex from 855 to 860. He was the second of five sons of King Æthelwulf. In 850, Æthelbald's elder brother Æthelstan defeated the Vikings in the first recorded sea battle in English history, but he is not recorded afterwards and probably died in the early 850s. The next year Æthelwulf and Æthelbald inflicted another defeat on the Vikings at the Battle of Aclea. In 855 Æthelwulf went on pilgrimage to Rome and appointed Æthelbald King of Wessex, while Æthelberht, the next oldest son, became King of Kent, which had been conquered by Wessex thirty years earlier.","image":"Æthelbald_-_MS_Royal_14_B_VI.jpg.webp","url":"Æthelbald,_King_of_Wessex"}
