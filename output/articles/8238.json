{"title":"California Gold Rush","summary":"The California Gold Rush (1848â€“1855) was a gold rush that began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.[1] The news of gold brought approximately 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.[2] The sudden influx of gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and the sudden population increase allowed California to go rapidly to statehood, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and accelerated the Native American population's decline from disease, starvation and the California genocide.","image":"1850_Woman_and_Men_in_California_Gold_Rush.jpg.webp","url":"California_Gold_Rush"}
