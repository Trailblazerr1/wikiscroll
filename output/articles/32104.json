{"title":"Nile","summary":"The Nile[lower-alpha 2] is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The longest river in Africa, it has historically been considered the longest river in the world,[3][4] though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.[5][6] The Nile is amongst the smallest of the major world rivers by measure of cubic metres flowing annually.[7] About 6,650 km (4,130 mi)[lower-alpha 1] long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[9] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.[10] Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing.","image":"Evening%2C_Nile_River%2C_Uganda.jpg.webp","url":"Nile"}
