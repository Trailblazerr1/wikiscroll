{"title":"Primary biliary cholangitis","summary":"Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis, is an autoimmune disease of the liver.[1][2][3] It results from a slow, progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver, causing bile and other toxins to build up in the liver, a condition called cholestasis. Further slow damage to the liver tissue can lead to scarring, fibrosis, and eventually cirrhosis.","image":"Primary_biliary_cirrhosis_intermed_mag_much_cropping.jpg.webp","url":"Primary_biliary_cholangitis"}
