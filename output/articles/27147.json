{"title":"Livy","summary":"Titus Livius (Latin: [ˈtɪtʊs ˈliːwiʊs]; 64/59 BC – AD 12/17), known as Livy (/ˈlɪvi/ LIV-ee) in English, was a Roman historian. He wrote a monumental history of Rome and the Roman people, titled Ab Urbe Condita, ''From the Founding of the City'', covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional founding in 753 BC through the reign of Augustus in Livy's own lifetime. He was on familiar terms with members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and a friend of Augustus,[1] whose young grandnephew, the future emperor Claudius, he exhorted to take up the writing of history.[2]","image":"Titus_Livius.png.webp"}
