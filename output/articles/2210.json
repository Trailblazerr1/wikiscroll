{"title":"Admiral Hipper-class cruiser","summary":"The Admiral Hipper class was a group of five heavy cruisers built by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine beginning in the mid-1930s. The class comprised Admiral Hipper, the lead ship, Blücher, Prinz Eugen, Seydlitz, and Lützow. Only the first three ships of the class saw action with the German Navy during World War II. Work on Seydlitz stopped when she was approximately 95 percent complete; it was decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier, but this was not completed either. Lützow was sold incomplete to the Soviet Union in 1940.","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-63-24%2C_Schwerer_Kreuzer_\"Admiral_Hipper\".jpg.webp"}
