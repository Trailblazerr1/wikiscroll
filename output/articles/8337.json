{"title":"Camp David Accords","summary":"The Camp David Accords were a pair of political agreements signed by Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on 17 September 1978,[1] following twelve days of secret negotiations at Camp David, the country retreat of the President of the United States in Maryland.[2] The two framework agreements were signed at the White House and were witnessed by President Jimmy Carter. The second of these frameworks (A Framework for the Conclusion of a Peace Treaty between Egypt and Israel) led directly to the 1979 Egyptâ€“Israel peace treaty. Due to the agreement, Sadat and Begin received the shared 1978 Nobel Peace Prize. The first framework (A Framework for Peace in the Middle East), which dealt with the Palestinian territories, was written without participation of the Palestinians and was condemned by the United Nations.","image":"lossy-page1-200px-Close_up_of_Menahem_Begin%2C_Jimmy_Carter_and_Anwar_Sadat_at_Camp_David.%2C_09-07-1978_-_NARA_-_181133.tif.jpg.webp","url":"Camp_David_Accords"}
