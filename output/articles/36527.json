{"title":"Punic people","summary":"The Punic people or Western Phoenicians, were a group of Semitic peoples in the Western Mediterranean who traced their origins to the Phoenicians of the coasts of Western Asia. In modern scholarship, the term 'Punic' – the Latin equivalent of the Greek-derived term 'Phoenician' – is exclusively used to refer to Phoenicians in the Western Mediterranean, following the line of the Greek East and Latin West.","image":"Phoenician_grinning_mask_-_Cagliari%2C_Museo_Archeologico_Nazionale_(26721011486).jpg.webp"}
