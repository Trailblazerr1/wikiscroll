The cup was, chronologically, the second seasonal inter-European club competition organised by UEFA. The first competition was held in 1960–61, but it was organised by the Mitropa Cup's Organising Committee and not recognised by the governing body of European football until 1963, when it was accepted as a UEFA competition on the initiative of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC).[1] The tournament ran for 39 seasons, with the final edition held in 1998–99, after which it was absorbed into the UEFA Cup.","image":"Cup_Winners_Cup.png.webp","url":"UEFA_Cup_Winners'_Cup"}
