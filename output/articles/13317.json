{"title":"Dolly (sheep)","summary":"Dolly (5 July 1996 â€“ 14 February 2003) was a female Finnish Dorset sheep and the first mammal cloned from an adult somatic cell.  She was cloned by associates of the Roslin Institute in Scotland, using the process of nuclear transfer from a cell taken from a mammary gland.  Her cloning proved that a cloned organism could be produced from a mature cell from a specific body part.[2] Contrary to popular belief, she was not the first animal to be cloned.[3]","image":"Dolly_face_closeup.jpg.webp","url":"Dolly_(sheep)"}
