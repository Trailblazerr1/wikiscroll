{"title":"El Niño–Southern Oscillation","summary":"El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an irregular periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, affecting the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics. The warming phase of the sea temperature is known as El Niño and the cooling phase as La Niña. The Southern Oscillation is the accompanying atmospheric component, coupled with the sea temperature change: El Niño is accompanied by high air surface pressure in the tropical western Pacific and  La Niña with low air surface pressure there.[1][2] The two periods last several months each and typically occur every few years with varying intensity per period.[3]","image":"Soi.svg.png.webp"}
