{"title":"Popular music","summary":"Popular music is music with wide appeal[1][2][3] that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training.[1]  It stands in contrast to both art music[4][5][6] and traditional or \"folk\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.[4][5][6]","image":"Year_music.svg.png.webp","url":"Popular_music"}
