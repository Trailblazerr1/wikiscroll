{"title":"Menopause","summary":"Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in  women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children.[1][7] Menopause usually occurs between the age of 49 and 52.[2] Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year.[3] It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries.[8] In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have ovaries, menopause may be considered to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell.[8] Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age.[9]","image":"Symptoms_of_menopause_(vector).svg.png.webp","url":"Menopause"}
