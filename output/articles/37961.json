{"title":"Rifle","summary":"A rifle is a long-barrelled firearm designed for accurate shooting, with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the bore wall. In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting.  Rifles are used extensively in warfare, self defense, law enforcement, crime (most notably assassinations), hunting, and shooting sports.","image":"Henry_Rifle.jpg.webp","url":"Rifle"}
