{"title":"Bird of prey","summary":"Birds of prey, also known as raptors, include species of bird that primarily hunt and feed on vertebrates that are large relative to the hunter. Additionally, they have keen eyesight for detecting food at a distance or during flight, strong feet equipped with talons for grasping or killing prey, and powerful, curved beaks for tearing flesh.[1][2][3] The term raptor is derived from the Latin word rapio, meaning to seize or take by force.[4] In addition to hunting live prey, many birds, such as fish eagles, vultures, and condors, eat carrion.[1]","image":"Birds_of_Prey_Diversity.jpg.webp"}
