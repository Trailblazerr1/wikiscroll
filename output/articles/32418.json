{"title":"Northern Rhodesia","summary":"Northern Rhodesia was a protectorate in south central Africa, formed in 1911 by amalgamating the two earlier protectorates of Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia and North-Eastern Rhodesia.[2][3][4][5] It was initially administered, as were the two earlier protectorates, by the British South Africa Company (BSAC), a chartered company, on behalf of the British Government. From 1924, it was administered by the British Government as a protectorate, under similar conditions to other British-administered protectorates, and the special provisions required when it was administered by BSAC were terminated.[5][6]","image":"Flag_of_Northern_Rhodesia_(1939â€“1964).svg.png.webp","url":"Northern_Rhodesia"}
