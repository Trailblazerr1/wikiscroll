{"title":"List of Scotland international footballers","summary":"The Scotland national football team is the joint-oldest international football team, having played in the first official international match, a goalless draw on 30 November 1872 against England.[1] Since then, the team has established a long-standing rivalry with England, particularly in the annual British Home Championship, which Scotland won 24 times outright and shared a further 17 times.[2] The team has enjoyed less success in continental and global competition. Even though Scotland has participated in eight FIFA World Cup and three UEFA European Championship final tournaments,[3] the team has never progressed beyond the first round of any major tournament.[3][4]","image":"Scotland-holland_euro_96.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Scotland_international_footballers"}
