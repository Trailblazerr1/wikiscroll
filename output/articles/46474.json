{"title":"Ubuntu version history","summary":"Ubuntu releases are made semiannually by Canonical Ltd, the developers of the Ubuntu operating system, using the year and month of the release as a version number. The first Ubuntu release, for example, was Ubuntu 4.10 and was released on 20 October 2004.[1][2] Consequently, version numbers for future versions are provisional; if the release is delayed until a different month (or even year) to that planned, the version number will change accordingly.[3]","image":"VirtualBox_Ubuntu_21.10_15_10_2021_13_19_12_ENG.png.webp"}
