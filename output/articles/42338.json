{"title":"Sticky & Sweet Tour","summary":"The Sticky & Sweet Tour was the eighth concert tour by American singer Madonna, to promote her eleventh studio album, Hard Candy (2008). It was Madonna's first major venture under a new ten-year 360 deal with Live Nation. Following a series of promotional appearances in support of Hard Candy, the tour was announced on May 2008, with concerts in Europe and North America; additionally, it marked the singer's first tour of Mexico and South America in fifteen years. It began in Cardiff on August 23, 2008, and ended in SÃ£o Paulo on December 21. Afterwards, it was announced that Madonna had decided to resume the tour in the summer of 2009, with twenty-five more concerts in European markets she had either never played in or visited in several years; the 2009 extension started at London's The O2 on July 4 and concluded two months later in Tel Aviv. Though initially planned, the tour did not visit Australia due to financial problems and the financial recession. It was described as a \"rock driven dancetastic journey\" and, like previous tours by the singer, was divided into different thematic acts: Pimp, Old School, Gypsy and Rave.","image":"Madonna_-_Sticky_and_Sweet_Tour_(poster).png.webp"}
