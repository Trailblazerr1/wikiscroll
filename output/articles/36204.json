{"title":"Programmed cell death","summary":"Programmed cell death (PCD; sometimes referred to as cellular suicide[1]) is the death of a cell as a result of events inside of a cell, such as apoptosis or autophagy.[2][3] PCD is carried out in a biological process, which usually confers advantage during an organism's lifecycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are separate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and animal tissue development.","image":"Signal_transduction_pathways.svg.png.webp","url":"Programmed_cell_death"}
