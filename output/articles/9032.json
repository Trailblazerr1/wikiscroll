{"title":"Cellular network","summary":"A cellular network or mobile network is a communication network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless. The network is distributed over land areas called \"cells\", each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver (typically three cell sites or base transceiver stations). These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell.[1]","image":"Transmitting_tower_top_us.jpg.webp"}
