{"title":"Protein–protein interaction","summary":"Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are physical contacts of high specificity established between two or more protein molecules as a result of biochemical events steered by interactions that include electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect. Many are physical contacts with molecular associations between chains that occur in a cell or in a living organism in a specific biomolecular context.","image":"1dfj_RNAseInhibitor-RNAse_complex.jpg.webp"}
