{"title":"Socialist mode of production","summary":"The socialist mode of production, also referred to as the communist mode of production, the lower-stage of communism[1] or simply socialism as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels used the terms communism and socialism interchangeably,[2][3] is a specific historical phase of economic development and its corresponding set of social relations that emerge from capitalism in the schema of historical materialism within Marxist theory. The Marxist definition of socialism is that of an economic transition. In this transition, the sole criterion for production is use-value (i.e. direct satisfaction of human needs, or economic demands), therefore the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Marxist production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning. Distribution of products is based on the principle of \"to each according to his contribution\". The social relations of socialism are characterized by the proletariat effectively controlling the means of production, either through cooperative enterprises or by public ownership or private artisanal tools and self-management. Surplus value goes to the working class and hence society as a whole.[4]","image":"Marx_and_Engels.jpg.webp","url":"Socialist_mode_of_production"}
