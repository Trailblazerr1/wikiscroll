{"title":"Salic law","summary":"The Salic law (/ˈsælɪk/ or /ˈseɪlɪk/; Latin: Lex salica), also called the Salian law, was the ancient Frankish civil law code compiled around AD 500 by the first Frankish King, Clovis. The written text is in Latin[1] and contains some of the earliest known instances of Old Dutch.[2] It remained the basis of Frankish law throughout the early Medieval period, and influenced future European legal systems. The best-known tenet of the old law is the principle of exclusion of women from inheritance of thrones, fiefs and other property. The Salic laws were arbitrated by a committee appointed and empowered by the King of the Franks. Dozens of manuscripts dating from the sixth to eighth centuries and three emendations as late as the ninth century have survived.[3]","image":"Jugement_de_Childebert_III_accordant_à_l'abbaye_de_Saint-Denis_la_terre_de_Hodenc-l'Evêque_dans_l'Oise.jpg.webp","url":"Salic_law"}
