{"title":"Ski flying","summary":"Ski flying is a winter sport discipline derived from ski jumping, in which much greater distances can be achieved. It is a form of competitive individual Nordic skiing where athletes descend at high speed along a specially designed takeoff ramp using skis only; jump from the end of it with as much power as they can generate; then glide – or 'fly' – as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill; and ultimately land within a target zone in a stable manner. Points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges. Events are governed by the International Ski Federation (Fédération Internationale de Ski; FIS).","image":"Simon_Ammann_World_Cup_Ski_flying_Vikersund_2011.jpg.webp","url":"Ski_flying"}
