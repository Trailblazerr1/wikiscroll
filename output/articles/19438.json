{"title":"Halite","summary":"Halite (/ˈhælˌaɪt, ˈheɪˌlaɪt/),[7][8][9][10] commonly known as rock salt, is a type of salt, the mineral (natural) form of sodium chloride (NaCl). Halite forms isometric crystals.[11] The mineral is typically colorless or white, but may also be light blue, dark blue, purple, pink, red, orange, yellow or gray depending on inclusion of other materials, impurities, and structural or isotopic abnormalities in the crystals.[12] It commonly occurs with  other evaporite deposit minerals such as several of the sulfates, halides, and borates. The name halite is derived from the Ancient Greek word for \"salt\", ἅλς (háls).[3]","image":"Halit_(NaCl)_-_Kopalnia_soli_Wieliczka%2C_Polska.jpg.webp","url":"Halite"}
