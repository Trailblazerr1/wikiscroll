{"title":"Gut microbiota","summary":"Gut microbiota are the microorganisms including bacteria, archaea and microscopic eukaryotes that live in the digestive tracts of humans[1] and other animals including insects. Alternative terms include gut flora (an outdated term that technically refers to plants) and gut microbiome. The gastrointestinal metagenome (sometimes defined as the microbiome) is the aggregate of all the genomes of gut microbiota.[2][3] The gut is the main location of human microbiota.[4] The gut microbiota has broad impacts, including effects on colonization resistance to pathogens, maintaining the intestinal epithelium, metabolizing dietary and pharmaceutical compounds, controlling immune function, and even behavior through the gut-brain axis.","image":"EscherichiaColi_NIAID.jpg.webp","url":"Gut_microbiota"}
