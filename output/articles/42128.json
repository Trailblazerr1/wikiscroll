{"title":"State highway","summary":"A state highway, state road, or state route (and the equivalent provincial highway, provincial road, or provincial route) is usually a road that is either numbered or maintained by a sub-national state or province. A road numbered by a state or province falls below numbered national highways (Canada being a notable exception to this rule) in the hierarchy (route numbers are used to aid navigation, and may or may not indicate ownership or maintenance). Roads maintained by a state or province include both nationally numbered highways and un-numbered state highways. Depending on the state, \"state highway\" may be used for one meaning and \"state road\" or \"state route\" for the other.","image":"Australian_state_route_3.svg.png.webp","url":"State_highway"}
