{"title":"Cornish language","summary":"Cornish (Standard Written Form: Kernewek or Kernowek[6]) is a Southwestern Brittonic language of the Celtic language family. It is a revived language, having become extinct as a living community language in Cornwall at the end of the 18th century. However, knowledge of Cornish, including speaking ability to a certain extent, continued to be passed on within families and by individuals,[7] and a revival began in the early 20th century. The language has a growing number of second language speakers,[8] and a very small number of families now raise children to speak revived Cornish as a first language.[9][10] Cornish is currently recognised under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages,[11] and the language is often described as an important part of Cornish identity, culture and heritage.[12][13]","image":"Britonia6hcentury.png.webp","url":"Cornish_language"}
