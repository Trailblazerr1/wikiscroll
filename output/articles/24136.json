{"title":"Julius and Ethel Rosenberg","summary":"Julius Rosenberg and Ethel Rosenberg (née Greenglass) were American citizens who were convicted of spying on behalf of the Soviet Union. The couple were convicted of providing top-secret information about radar, sonar, jet propulsion engines and valuable nuclear weapon designs (at that time the United States was the only country in the world with nuclear weapons). Convicted of espionage in 1951, they were executed by the federal government of the United States in 1953 in the Sing Sing correctional facility in Ossining, New York, becoming the first American civilians to be executed for such charges and the first to suffer that penalty during peacetime.[1][2][3][4]","image":"Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg_NYWTS.jpg.webp"}
