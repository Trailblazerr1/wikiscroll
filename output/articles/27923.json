{"title":"Made man","summary":"In the American and Sicilian Mafia, a made man is a fully initiated member of the Mafia. To become \"made\", an associate first must be Italian or of Italian descent and sponsored by another made man. An inductee will be required to take the oath of omert√†, the Mafia code of silence and code of honor. After the induction ceremony, the associate becomes a \"made man\" and holds the rank of soldier (Italian: soldato) in the Mafia hierarchy. Made men are the only ones who can rise through the ranks of the Mafia, from soldier to caporegime, consigliere, underboss, and boss.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Made_man"}
