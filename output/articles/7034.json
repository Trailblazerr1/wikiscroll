{"title":"Bob Dylan (album)","summary":"Bob Dylan is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 19, 1962[8] by Columbia Records. The album was produced by Columbia's legendary talent scout John H. Hammond, who had earlier signed Dylan to the label, a decision which was at the time controversial. The album primarily features folk standards, but also includes two original compositions, \"Talkin' New York\" and \"Song to Woody\". The latter was an ode to Woody Guthrie, a major influence in Dylan's early career.","image":"Bob_Dylan_-_Bob_Dylan.gif"}
