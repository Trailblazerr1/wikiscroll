{"title":"Pansy","summary":"The garden pansy (Viola × wittrockiana) is a type of large-flowered hybrid plant cultivated as a garden flower.[2] It is derived by hybridization from several species in the section Melanium (\"the pansies\")[3] of the genus Viola, particularly Viola tricolor, a wildflower of Europe and western Asia known as heartsease. It is sometimes known as Viola tricolor var. hortensis, but this scientific name is ambiguous. While Viola tricolor var. hortensis Groenland & Rümpler is a synonym of Viola × wittrockiana,[1] Viola tricolor var. hortensis DC. refers to a horticultural variety of wild pansy (Viola tricolor without interspecific hybridization) that had been illustrated in Flora Danica in 1777[4][5] before the existence of Viola × wittrockiana.[1][6]","image":"Pansy_Flower.jpg.webp","url":"Pansy"}
