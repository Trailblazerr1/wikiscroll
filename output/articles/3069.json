{"title":"Alpine chough","summary":"The Alpine chough (/ˈtʃʌf/), or yellow-billed chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), is a bird in the crow family, one of only two species in the genus Pyrrhocorax. Its two subspecies breed in high mountains from Spain eastwards through southern Europe and North Africa to Central Asia and Nepal, and it may nest at a higher altitude than any other bird. The eggs have adaptations to the thin atmosphere that improve oxygen take-up and reduce water loss.","image":"Alpine_Chough_by_Jim_Higham.jpg.webp","url":"Alpine_chough"}
