{"title":"Flatulence","summary":"Flatulence is defined in the medical literature as \"flatus expelled through the anus\" or the \"quality or state of being flatulent\",[1] which is defined in turn as \"marked by or affected with gases generated in the intestine or stomach; likely to cause digestive flatulence\".[2] The root of these words is from the Latin flatus â€“ \"a blowing, a breaking wind\".[3] Flatus is also the medical word for gas generated in the stomach or bowels.[4] Despite these standard definitions, a proportion of intestinal gas may be swallowed environmental air, and hence flatus is not totally generated in the stomach or bowels. The scientific study of this area of medicine is termed flatology.[5]","image":"Illustration_of_man_suffering_from_wind._Wellcome_L0005360.jpg.webp"}
