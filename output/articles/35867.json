{"title":"Presentation of Jesus at the Temple","summary":"The Presentation of Jesus at (or in) the Temple is an early episode in the life of Jesus, describing His presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem, to be redeemed by the parents' sacrifice from His birth-state of sanctity, i.e. and predestined by His firstborn status to serve as a priest. The feast is celebrated by many Christian Churches on the holiday of Candlemas. It is described in chapter 2 of the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament of the Christian Bible.[1] Within the account, \"Luke's narration of the Presentation in the Temple combines the purification rite with the Jewish ceremony of the redemption of the firstborn (Luke 2:23–24).\"[2]","image":"Ambrogio_Lorenzetti_-_Presentazione_di_Gesù_al_tempio_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp"}
