{"title":"Passover sacrifice","summary":"The Passover sacrifice (Hebrew: קרבן  פסח‎, romanized: Qorban Pesaḥ), also known as the Paschal lamb or the Passover lamb, is the sacrifice that the Torah mandates the Israelites to ritually slaughter on the evening of Passover, and eat on the first night of the holiday with bitter herbs and matzo. According to the Torah, it was first offered on the night of the Exodus from Egypt. Although practiced by Jews in ancient times, the sacrifice is today only part of Falashah, Karaite and Samaritan observance.","image":"מעמד_הכנה_לקראת_קרבן_פסח.JPG.webp","url":"Passover_sacrifice"}
