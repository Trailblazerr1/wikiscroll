{"title":"Chrysiridia rhipheus","summary":"Chrysiridia rhipheus, the Madagascan sunset moth, is a species of day-flying moth of the family Uraniidae. It is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking lepidopterans.[10] Famous worldwide, it is featured in most coffee table books on Lepidoptera and is much sought after by collectors, though many older sources misspell the species name as \"ripheus\".[11][12] It is very colourful, though the iridescent parts of the wings do not have pigment; rather the colours originate from optical interference.[7][13] Adults have a wingspan of 7–9 cm (2.8–3.5 in).","image":"Urania_riphaeus_engraving.jpg.webp","url":"Chrysiridia_rhipheus"}
