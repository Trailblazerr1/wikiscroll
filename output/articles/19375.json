{"title":"Hagen–Poiseuille equation","summary":"In nonideal fluid dynamics, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation, also known as the Hagen–Poiseuille law, Poiseuille law or Poiseuille equation, is a physical law that gives the pressure drop in an incompressible and Newtonian fluid in laminar flow flowing through a long cylindrical pipe of constant cross section. It can be successfully applied to air flow in lung alveoli, or the flow through a drinking straw or through a hypodermic needle. It was experimentally derived independently by Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille in 1838[1] and Gotthilf Heinrich Ludwig Hagen,[2] and published by Poiseuille in 1840–41 and 1846.[1] The theoretical justification of the Poiseuille law was given by George Stokes in 1845.[3]","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg","url":"Hagen–Poiseuille_equation"}
