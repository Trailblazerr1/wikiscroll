{"title":"Hukou","summary":"Hukou (Chinese: 户口; lit. 'household individual') is a system of household registration used in mainland China.  The system itself is more properly called \"huji\" (Chinese: 户籍; lit. 'household origin'), and has origins in ancient China; hukou is the registration of an individual in the system (kou literally means \"mouth\", which originates from the practise of regarding family members as \"mouths to feed\", similar to the phrase \"per head\" in English).  A household registration record officially identifies a person as a permanent resident of an area and includes identifying information such as name, parents, spouse and date of birth.  A hukou can also refer to a family register in many contexts since the household register (simplified Chinese: 户口簿; traditional Chinese: 戶口簿; pinyin: hùkǒu bù) is issued per family, and usually includes the births, deaths, marriages, divorces, and moves, of all members in the family.","image":"National_Emblem_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China_(2).svg.png.webp","url":"Hukou"}
