{"title":"Greywacke","summary":"Greywacke or graywacke (German grauwacke, signifying a grey, earthy rock) is a variety of sandstone generally characterized by its hardness, dark color, and poorly sorted angular grains of quartz, feldspar, and small rock fragments or lithic fragments set in a compact, clay-fine matrix. It is a texturally immature sedimentary rock generally found in Paleozoic strata. The larger grains can be sand- to gravel-sized, and matrix materials generally constitute more than 15% of the rock by volume. The term \"greywacke\" can be confusing, since it can refer to either the immature (rock fragment) aspect of the rock or its fine-grained (clay) component.","image":"Feldspathic-wacke.jpg.webp","url":"Greywacke"}
