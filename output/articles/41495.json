{"title":"South Wales","summary":"South Wales (Welsh: de Cymru) is a loosely defined region of Wales bordered by England to the east and mid Wales to the north. It has a population of around 2.2 million, almost three-quarters of the whole of Wales,  including 400,000 in Cardiff, 250,000 in Swansea and 150,000 in Newport. Generally considered to include the historic counties of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, south Wales extends westwards to include Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire.  In the western extent, from Swansea westwards, local people would probably recognise that they lived in both south Wales and west Wales.[1] The Brecon Beacons National Park covers about a third of south Wales, containing Pen y Fan, the highest British mountain south of Cadair Idris in Snowdonia.","image":"Pen_y_Fan_from_Cribyn.jpg.webp"}
