{"title":"Palladian architecture","summary":"Palladian architecture is a European architectural style derived from and inspired by the designs of the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio (1508â€“1580). What is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of his original concepts. Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective, and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. From the 17th century Palladio's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as \"Palladianism\". It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century.","image":"Andrea_palladio_fourth_book_image.jpg.webp","url":"Palladian_architecture"}
