{"title":"Arrow of time","summary":"The arrow of time, also called time's arrow, is the concept positing the \"one-way direction\" or \"asymmetry\" of time. It was developed in 1927 by the British astrophysicist Arthur Eddington, and is an unsolved general physics question. This direction, according to Eddington, could be determined by studying the organization of atoms, molecules, and bodies, and might be drawn upon a four-dimensional relativistic map of the world (\"a solid block of paper\").[1]","image":"Arthur_Stanley_Eddington.jpg.webp"}
