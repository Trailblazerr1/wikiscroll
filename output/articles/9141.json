{"title":"Ceremonial counties of England","summary":"The counties and areas for the purposes of the lieutenancies, also referred to as the lieutenancy areas of England[2] and informally known as ceremonial counties,[3] are areas of England to which lord-lieutenants are appointed. Legally, the areas in England, as well as in Wales and Scotland, are defined by the Lieutenancies Act 1997 as \"counties and areas for the purposes of the lieutenancies in Great Britain\", in contrast to the areas used for local government. They are also informally known as \"geographic counties\",[4] to distinguish them from other types of counties of England.","image":"English_ceremonial_counties_1998.svg.png.webp"}
