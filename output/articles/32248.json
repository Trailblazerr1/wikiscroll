{"title":"Noise rock","summary":"Noise rock (sometimes called noise punk)[2] is a noise-oriented style of experimental rock[3] that spun off from punk rock in the 1980s.[4][5] Drawing on movements such as minimalism, industrial music, and New York hardcore,[6] artists indulge in extreme levels of distortion through the use of electric guitars and, less frequently, electronic instrumentation, either to provide percussive sounds or to contribute to the overall arrangement.[4]","image":"Velvet_Underground_1968_by_Billy_Name.png.webp"}
