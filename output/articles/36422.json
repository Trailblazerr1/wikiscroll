{"title":"Psychological nativism","summary":"In the field of psychology, nativism is the view that certain skills or abilities are \"native\" or hard-wired into the brain at birth. This is in contrast to the \"blank slate\" or tabula rasa view, which states that the brain has inborn capabilities for learning from the environment but does not contain content such as innate beliefs. This factor contributes to the ongoing nature versus nurture dispute, one borne from the current difficulty of reverse engineering the subconscious operations of the brain, especially the human brain.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
