{"title":"ß","summary":"In German orthography, the letter ß, called  Eszett (IPA: [ɛsˈtsɛt]) or scharfes S (IPA: [ˌʃaʁfəs ˈʔɛs], lit. \"sharp S\"), represents the /s/ phoneme in Standard German when following long vowels and diphthongs. The name Eszett combines the names of the letters of ⟨s⟩ (Es) and ⟨z⟩ (Zett) in German. The character's Unicode names in English are sharp s[1] and eszett.[1] The letter is only used in German, and can be replaced with ⟨ss⟩ if the character is unavailable or capitalized, though a capitalized version has existed officially since 2017. In the 20th century, it was completely replaced by ⟨ss⟩ in Swiss Standard German (used in Switzerland and Liechtenstein),[2]  while it remains part of the orthography of Standard German elsewhere.","image":"Latin_letter_eszett.svg.png.webp","url":"ß"}
