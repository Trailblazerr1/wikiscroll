{"title":"Historicism","summary":"Historicism is the idea of attributing significance to elements of space and time, such as historical period, geographical place, and local culture, in order to contextualize theories, narratives and other interpretative instruments. The term historicism (Historismus) was coined by German philosopher Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel.[1] Over time, what historicism is and how it is practiced have developed different and divergent meanings.[2] Elements of historicism appear in the writings of French essayist Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) and Italian philosopher G. B. Vico (1668–1744), and became more fully developed with the dialectic of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), influential in 19th-century Europe. The writings of Karl Marx, influenced by Hegel, also include historicism. The term is also associated with the empirical social sciences and with the work of Franz Boas. Historicism tends to be hermeneutic because it values cautious, rigorous, and contextualized interpretation of information; or relativist, because it rejects notions of universal, fundamental and immutable interpretations.[3]","image":"G.W.F._Hegel_(by_Sichling%2C_after_Sebbers).jpg.webp"}
