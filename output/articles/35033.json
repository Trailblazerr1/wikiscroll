{"title":"Pink slime","summary":"Pink slime (also known as lean finely textured beef or LFTB,[1] finely textured beef,[2] or boneless lean beef trimmings or BLBT[3]) is a meat by-product used as a food additive to ground beef and beef-based processed meats, as a filler, or to reduce the overall fat content of ground beef.[4][5] As part of the production process, heat and centrifuges remove the fat from the meat in beef trimmings.[6] The resulting paste, without the fat, is exposed to ammonia gas or citric acid to kill bacteria.[6] In 2001, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved the product for limited human consumption. The product, when prepared using ammonia gas, is banned for human consumption in the European Union.[7]","image":"Lean_finely_textured_beef_in_its_finished_form.png.webp","url":"Pink_slime"}
