{"title":"Benign tumor","summary":"A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that lacks the ability to either invade neighboring tissue or metastasize (spread throughout the body). When removed, benign tumors usually do not grow back, whereas malignant tumors sometimes do. Unlike most benign tumors elsewhere in the body, benign brain tumors can be life-threatening.[1] Benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate than malignant tumors and the tumor cells are usually more differentiated (cells have more normal features).[2][3][4] They are typically surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of connective tissue) or stay contained within the epithelium.[5] Common examples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids.","image":"Normal_Epidermis_and_Dermis_with_Intradermal_Nevus_10x.JPG.webp"}
