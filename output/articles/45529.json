{"title":"Topoisomerase","summary":"Topoisomerases (or DNA topoisomerases)  are enzymes that participate in the overwinding or underwinding of DNA. The winding problem of DNA arises due to the intertwined nature of its double-helical structure. During DNA replication and transcription, DNA becomes overwound ahead of a replication fork. If left unabated, this torsion would eventually stop the ability of DNA or RNA polymerases involved in these processes to continue down the DNA strand.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Topoisomerase"}
