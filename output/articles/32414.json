In 2011, its population was 1,810,863,[3] constituting about 30% of the island's population and about 3% of the UK's population. The Northern Ireland Assembly (colloquially referred to as Stormont after its location), established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998, holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in several areas.[13]","image":"Northern_Ireland_in_the_UK_and_Europe.svg.png.webp","url":"Northern_Ireland"}
