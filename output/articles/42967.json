{"title":"Suzuki Cultus","summary":"The Suzuki Cultus is a supermini car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Suzuki from 1983 to 2003. The nameplate is currently used as a rebadged second-generation Suzuki Celerio in Pakistan since 2017. It was first presented at the 25th Tokyo Motor Show, formally introduced to Japan in 1983 and ultimately sold in seven countries across three generations and marketed worldwide as the Suzuki Swift for the first two generations. An alliance formed in 1981 between GM and Suzuki (and Isuzu) allowed GM to market the Cultus as a captive import internationally under more than a dozen nameplates including the Geo Metro, Chevrolet Sprint, Pontiac Firefly and Holden Barina.[1] It was also known as the M-car within GM.","image":"2nd_generation_Suzuki_Cultus.jpg.webp"}
