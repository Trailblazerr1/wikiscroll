{"title":"Moldavia","summary":"Moldavia (Romanian: Moldova, pronounced [molˈdova] (listen) or Țara Moldovei, literally \"The Moldavian Country\"; in Romanian Cyrillic: Молдова or Цара Мѡлдовєй; Church Slavonic: Землѧ Молдавскаѧ; Greek: Ἡγεμονία τῆς Μολδαβίας) is a historical region and former principality in Central and Eastern Europe,[8][9][10] corresponding to the territory between the Eastern Carpathians and the Dniester River. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with Wallachia (Țara Românească) as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak), all of Bukovina and Hertsa. The region of Pokuttya was also part of it for a period of time.","image":"Flag_of_Moldavia.svg.png.webp","url":"Moldavia"}
