{"title":"Organometallic chemistry","summary":"Organometallic chemistry is the study of organometallic compounds, chemical compounds containing at least one chemical bond between a carbon atom of an organic molecule and a metal, including alkaline, alkaline earth, and transition metals, and sometimes broadened to include metalloids like boron, silicon, and selenium, as well.[1][2] Aside from bonds to organyl fragments or molecules, bonds to 'inorganic' carbon, like carbon monoxide (metal carbonyls), cyanide, or carbide, are generally considered to be organometallic as well.  Some related compounds such as transition metal hydrides and metal phosphine complexes are often included in discussions of organometallic compounds, though strictly speaking, they are not necessarily organometallic. The related but distinct term \"metalorganic compound\" refers to metal-containing compounds lacking direct metal-carbon bonds but which contain organic ligands.  Metal Î²-diketonates, alkoxides, dialkylamides, and metal phosphine complexes are representative members of this class.  The field of organometallic chemistry combines aspects of traditional inorganic and organic chemistry.[3]","image":"N-butyllithium-tetramer-3D-balls.png.webp","url":"Organometallic_chemistry"}
