{"title":"Message authentication code","summary":"In cryptography, a message authentication code (MAC), sometimes known as a tag, is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message. In other words, to confirm that the message came from the stated sender (its authenticity) and has not been changed. The MAC value protects a message's data integrity, as well as its authenticity, by allowing verifiers (who also possess the secret key) to detect any changes to the message content.","image":"MAC.svg.png.webp","url":"Message_authentication_code"}
