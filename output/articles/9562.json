{"title":"Cheyenne","summary":"The Cheyenne (/ʃaɪˈæn/ shy-AN) are one of the indigenous peoples of the Great Plains whose language is of the Algonquian language family. The Cheyenne comprise two Native American tribes, the Só'taeo'o or Só'taétaneo'o (more commonly spelled as Suhtai or Sutaio) and the Tsétsêhéstâhese (also spelled Tsitsistas, [t͡sɪt͡shɪstʰɑs][3]). The tribes merged in the early 19th century. Today, the Cheyenne people are split into two federally recognized Nations: the Southern Cheyenne, who are enrolled in the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma, and the Northern Cheyenne, who are enrolled in the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana.","image":"Gilcrease_-_Cheyenne_Beaded_Dress.jpg.webp","url":"Cheyenne"}
