{"title":"Shrubland","summary":"Shrubland, scrubland, scrub, brush, or bush is a plant community characterized by vegetation dominated by shrubs, often also including grasses, herbs, and geophytes. Shrubland may either occur naturally or be the result of human activity. It may be the mature vegetation type in a particular region and remain stable over time, or a transitional community that occurs temporarily as the result of a disturbance, such as fire.  A stable state may be maintained by regular natural disturbance such as fire or browsing.  Shrubland may be unsuitable for human habitation because of the danger of fire. The term was coined in 1903.[1]","image":"Starr_010831-0016_Morella_faya.jpg.webp"}
