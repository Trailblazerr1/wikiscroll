{"title":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man","summary":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the first novel of Irish writer James Joyce.  A KÃ¼nstlerroman written in a modernist style, it traces the religious and intellectual awakening of young Stephen Dedalus, Joyce's fictional alter ego, whose surname alludes to Daedalus, Greek mythology's consummate craftsman.  Stephen questions and rebels against the Catholic and Irish conventions under which he has grown, culminating in his self-exile from Ireland to Europe.  The work uses techniques that Joyce developed more fully in Ulysses (1922) and Finnegans Wake (1939).","image":"JamesJoyce_Portrait1916.jpg.webp"}
