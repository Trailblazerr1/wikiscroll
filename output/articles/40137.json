{"title":"Set (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a set is a collection of elements.[1][2][3]  The elements that make up a set can be any kind of mathematical objects: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets.[4]  The set with no element is the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton.  A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set.  Two sets are equal if and only if they have precisely the same elements.[5]","image":"Example_of_a_set.svg.png.webp","url":"Set_(mathematics)"}
