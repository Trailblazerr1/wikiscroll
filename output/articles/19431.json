{"title":"Half marathon","summary":"A half marathon is a road running event of 21.0975 kilometres (13 miles 192.5 yards)—half the distance of a marathon.[2] It is common for a half marathon event to be held concurrently with a marathon or a 5K race, using almost the same course with a late start, an early finish or shortcuts.  If finisher medals are awarded, the medal or ribbon may differ from those for the full marathon. The half marathon is also known as a 21K, 21.1K or 13.1 miles, although these values are rounded and not formally correct.","image":"Nychalfmarathon.jpg.webp","url":"Half_marathon"}
