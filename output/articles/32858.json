{"title":"Oligosaccharide","summary":"An oligosaccharide (/ˌɑlɪgoʊˈsækəˌɹaɪd/;[1] from the Greek ὀλίγος olígos, \"a few\", and σάκχαρ sácchar, \"sugar\") is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically three to ten[2][3][4][5]) of monosaccharides (simple sugars). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding.[6] For example, glycolipids have an important role in the immune response.","image":"N_Linked_Oligosh.png.webp","url":"Oligosaccharide"}
