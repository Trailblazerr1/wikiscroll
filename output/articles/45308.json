{"title":"Tito–Stalin split","summary":"The Tito–Stalin split (Serbo-Croatian: Raskol Tito–Staljin / Раскол Тито–Стаљин) or the Yugoslav–Soviet split (Russian: Советско-югославский конфликт) was the culmination of a conflict between the political leaderships of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, under Josip Broz Tito and Joseph Stalin, respectively, in the years following World War II. Although presented by both sides as an ideological dispute, the conflict was as much the product of a geopolitical struggle in the Balkans that also involved Albania, Bulgaria, as well as the communist insurgency in Greece, which Tito′s Yugoslavia supported and the Soviet Union secretly opposed.","image":"EasternBloc_BasicMembersOnly.svg.png.webp"}
