{"title":"Q code","summary":"The Q-code is a standardised collection of three-letter codes that each start with the letter \"Q\". It is an operating signal initially developed for commercial radiotelegraph communication and later adopted by other radio services, especially amateur radio. To distinguish the use of a Q-code transmitted as a question from the same Q-code transmitted as a statement, operators either prefixed it with the military network question marker \"INT\" (dit dit dah dit dah) or suffixed it with the standard Morse question mark UD (dit dit dah dah dit dit).","image":"International_Morse_Code.svg.png.webp"}
