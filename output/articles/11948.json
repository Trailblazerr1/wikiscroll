{"title":"Daisy (advertisement)","summary":"\"Daisy\", sometimes referred to as \"Daisy Girl\" or \"Peace, Little Girl\", was a controversial political advertisement that aired on television as part of Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign. Though officially aired only once, it is considered one of the most important factors in Johnson's landslide victory over the Republican Party's candidate, Barry Goldwater, and a turning point in political and advertising history. A partnership between the Doyle Dane Bernbach agency and Tony Schwartz created the \"Daisy\" advertisement, designed to broadcast Johnson's anti-war and anti-nuclear positions. Goldwater was against the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and suggested the use of nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War, if necessary. The Johnson campaign used Goldwater's speeches to imply he would wage a nuclear war.","image":"37_Lyndon_Johnson_3x4.jpg.webp"}
