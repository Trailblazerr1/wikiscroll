{"title":"Voyage of the James Caird","summary":"The voyage of the James Caird was a journey of 1,300 kilometres (800 mi) from Elephant Island in the South Shetland Islands through the Southern Ocean to South Georgia, undertaken by Sir Ernest Shackleton and five companions to obtain rescue for the main body of the stranded Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–1917. Polar historians regard the voyage of the crew in a 22.5-foot (6.9 m) lifeboat through the \"Furious Fifties\" as one of the greatest small-boat journeys ever completed.","image":"LaunchingTheJamesCaird2.jpg.webp"}
