{"title":"Hindu temple","summary":"A  Mandir or Hindu temple is a symbolic house, seat and body of divinity for Hindus. It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism.[1][2] The symbolism and structure of a Hindu temple are rooted in Vedic traditions, deploying circles and squares.[3] It also represents recursion and equivalence of the macrocosm and the microcosm by astronomical numbers, and by \"specific alignments related to the geography of the place and the presumed linkages of the deity and the patron\".[4][5] A temple incorporates all elements of Hindu cosmos—presenting the good, the evil and the human, as well as the elements of Hindu sense of cyclic time and the essence of life—symbolically presenting dharma, kama, artha, moksa, and karma.[6][7][8]","image":"Khajuraho_-_Kandariya_Mahadeo_Temple.jpg.webp","url":"Hindu_temple"}
