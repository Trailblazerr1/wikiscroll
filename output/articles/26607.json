{"title":"List of Ryder Cup matches","summary":"The Ryder Cup is a golf competition contested by teams from Europe and the United States. The competition was originally contested between Great Britain and the United States; players from the Channel Islands also appeared on the British team, Republic of Ireland golfers were added to the British team in 1953 (although the team name was only changed to 'Great Britain and Ireland' for the 1973 Ryder Cup) and this was extended to golfers elsewhere in Europe in 1979.[1] Established in 1927, the competition is jointly administered by the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA of America) and Ryder Cup Europe, a venture in which the PGA European Tour is the primary partner. The competition takes place every two years, with the exception of 2001 when the match was played a year later due to the 11 September attacks; the venue alternates between courses in Europe and the United States. The winners of the first match were the United States, who defeated Great Britain at Worcester Country Club 91⁄2–21⁄2. The latest Ryder Cup, at Le Golf National in Paris, France, was won by Europe 171⁄2–101⁄2 on 30 September 2018.[2]","image":"Ryder_Cup_at_the_2008_PGA_Golf_Show_new.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Ryder_Cup_matches"}
