{"title":"Woodland","summary":"A woodland (/ˈwʊdlənd/ (listen)) is, in the broad sense, land covered with trees,[1][2] or in a narrow sense, synonymous with wood (or in the U.S., the plurale tantum woods), a low-density forest forming open habitats with plenty of sunlight and limited shade (see differences between British, American, and Australian English explained below). Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including grasses. Woodland may form a transition to shrubland under drier conditions or during early stages of primary or secondary succession.  Higher-density areas of trees with a largely closed canopy that provides extensive and nearly continuous shade are often referred to as forests.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
