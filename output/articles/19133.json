{"title":"Guinea (coin)","summary":"The guinea (/ˈɡɪniː/ ; commonly abbreviated gn., or gns. in plural)[1] was a coin, minted in Great Britain between 1663 and 1814, that contained approximately one-quarter of an ounce of gold.[2] The name came from the Guinea region in West Africa, from where much of the gold used to make the coins was sourced.[3] It was the first English machine-struck gold coin, originally worth one pound sterling,[2] equal to twenty shillings, but rises in the price of gold relative to silver caused the value of the guinea to increase, at times to as high as thirty shillings. From 1717 to 1816, its value was officially fixed at twenty-one shillings.[4]","image":"5_Guineas%2C_James_II%2C_England%2C_1688_-_Bode-Museum_-_DSC02761.jpg.webp","url":"Guinea_(coin)"}
