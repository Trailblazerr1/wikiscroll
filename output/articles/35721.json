{"title":"Pottery","summary":"Pottery is the process and the products of forming vessels and other objects with clay and other ceramic materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard, durable form.   Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a potter is also called a pottery (plural \"potteries\").  The definition of pottery, used by the ASTM International, is \"all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products.\"[1] In archaeology, especially of ancient and prehistoric periods, \"pottery\" often means vessels only, and figures of the same material are called \"terracottas.\"  Clay as a part of the materials used is required by some definitions of pottery, but this is dubious.","image":"Sz√©kely_Land_-_Great_Market_Hall%2C_2014.09.12_(26).JPG.webp"}
