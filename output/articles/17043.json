{"title":"French Sudan","summary":"French Sudan (French: Soudan français; Arabic: السودان الفرنسي‎ as-Sūdān al-Faransī) was a French colonial territory in the Federation of French West Africa from around 1880 until 1959, when it joined the Mali Federation, and then in 1960, when it became the independent state of Mali. The colony was formally called French Sudan from 1890 until 1899 and then again from 1921 until 1958, and had a variety of different names over the course of its existence. The colony was initially established largely as a military project led by French troops, but in the mid-1890s it came under civilian administration.","image":"Flag_of_French_Sudan_(1958–1959).svg.png.webp"}
