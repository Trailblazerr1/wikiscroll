{"title":"Myoglobin","summary":"Myoglobin (symbol Mb or MB) is an iron- and oxygen-binding protein found in the cardiac and skeletal muscle tissue of vertebrates in general and in almost all mammals.[5][6][7][8][9] Myoglobin is distantly related to hemoglobin. Compared to hemoglobin, myoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and does not have cooperative binding with oxygen like hemoglobin does.[8][10]  In humans, myoglobin is only found in the bloodstream after muscle injury.[11][12][13]","image":"ChimeraX_rendering_of_myoglobin_(PDB_2SPL).png.webp"}
