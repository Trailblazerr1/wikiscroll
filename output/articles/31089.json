{"title":"NASCAR Xfinity Series","summary":"The NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) is a stock car racing series organized by NASCAR. It is promoted as NASCAR's \"minor league\" circuit, and is considered a proving ground for drivers who wish to step up to the organization's top level circuit, the NASCAR Cup Series.
