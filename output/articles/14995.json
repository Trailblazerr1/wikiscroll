{"title":"Epona","summary":"In Gallo-Roman religion,  Epona was a protector of horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules. She was particularly a goddess of fertility, as shown by her attributes of a patera, cornucopia, ears of grain and the presence of foals in some sculptures.[1] She and her horses might also have been leaders of the soul in the after-life ride, with parallels in Rhiannon of the Mabinogion.[2] The worship of Epona, \"the sole Celtic divinity ultimately worshipped in Rome itself\",[3] as the patroness of cavalry,[4] was widespread in the Roman Empire between the first and third centuries AD; this is unusual for a Celtic deity, most of whom were associated with specific localities.","image":"Luxembourg_MNHA_264_Epona_Contern.jpg.webp","url":"Epona"}
