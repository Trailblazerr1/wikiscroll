{"title":"Superspreading event","summary":"A superspreading event (SSEV) is an event in which an infectious disease is spread much more than usual, while an unusually contagious organism infected with a disease is known as a superspreader. In the context of a human-borne illness, a superspreader is an individual who is more likely to infect others, compared with a typical infected person. Such superspreaders are of particular concern in epidemiology.","image":"Hotel_Metropole_9th_floor_layout_SARS_2003.svg.png.webp"}
