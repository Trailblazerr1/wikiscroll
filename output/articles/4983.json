{"title":"Australian boobook","summary":"The Australian boobook (Ninox boobook), which is known in some regions as the mopoke, is a species of owl native to mainland Australia, southern New Guinea, the island of Timor, and the Sunda Islands. Described by John Latham in 1801, it was generally considered to be the same species as the morepork of New Zealand until 1999. Its name is derived from its two-tone boo-book call. Eight subspecies of the Australian boobook are recognized, with three further subspecies being reclassified as separate species in 2019 due to their distinctive calls and genetics.","image":"Ninox_boobook_2_-_Oatley.jpg.webp","url":"Australian_boobook"}
