{"title":"Philosophy of mind","summary":"Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the ontology and nature of the mind and its relationship with the body. The mindâ€“body problem is a paradigmatic issue in philosophy of mind, although a number of other issues are addressed, such as the hard problem of consciousness and the nature of particular mental states.[1][2][3] Aspects of the mind that are studied include mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, the ontology of the mind, the nature of thought, and the relationship of the mind to the body.","image":"Phrenology1.jpg.webp"}
