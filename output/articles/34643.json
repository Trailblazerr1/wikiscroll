{"title":"Peter Singer","summary":"Peter Albert David Singer AC (born 6 July 1946) is an Australian moral philosopher, currently the IraÂ W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University. He specialises in applied ethics and approaches ethical issues from a secular, utilitarian perspective. He is known in particular for his book Animal Liberation (1975), in which he argues in favour of veganism, and his essay \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\", in which he argues in favour of donating to help the global poor. For most of his career, he was a preference utilitarian, but he stated in The Point of View of the Universe (2014), coauthored with Katarzyna de Lazari-Radek, that he had become a hedonistic utilitarian.","image":"Peter_Singer_2017_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
