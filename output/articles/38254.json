{"title":"Robot Hall of Fame","summary":"The Robot Hall of Fame is an American hall of fame that recognises notable robots in various scientific fields and general society, as well as achievements in robotics technology. The organization was established in 2003 by the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as an acknowledgement of Pittsburgh's achievements in the field of robotics and with the aim of creating a broader awareness of the contributions of robotics in society.[1] The idea for the Robot Hall of Fame was conceived by Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science dean James H. Morris, who described it as a means of \"honour[ing] robots that have served an actual or potentially useful function and demonstrated real skill, along with robots that entertain and those that have achieved worldwide fame in the context of fiction.\"[1] The first induction ceremony was held at the Carnegie Science Center on November 10, 2003.[2] Thirty robots – both real and fictional – have been inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame since its inception.[3] An exhibit named Roboworld was later established at the Carnegie Science Center in June 2009, featuring a physical embodiment of the hall of fame.[4]","image":"Maria_from_the_film_Metropolis%2C_on_display_at_the_Robot_Hall_of_Fame.jpg.webp"}
