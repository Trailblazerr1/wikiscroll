{"title":"Biological pigment","summary":"Biological pigments, also known simply as pigments or biochromes,[1] are substances produced by living organisms that have a color resulting from selective color absorption. Biological pigments include plant pigments and flower pigments. Many biological structures, such as skin, eyes, feathers, fur and hair contain pigments such as melanin in specialized cells called chromatophores. In some species, pigments accrue over very long periods during an individual's lifespan.[2]","image":"Melopsittacus_undulatus.jpg.webp","url":"Biological_pigment"}
