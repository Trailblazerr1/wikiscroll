{"title":"Copra","summary":"Copra (Hindi: खोपरा, Khōprā ? > Malayalam: കൊപ്ര, Koppara ?) refers to the dried coconut kernels from which coconut oil is expelled.[1] Traditionally, the coconut kernels are sun-dried, especially for export, before the oil, also known as copra oil, is pressed out. The coconut fruit, when de-husked is essentially a drupe that is obtained from a tropical feather-leaved palm tree—the Coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). The oil extracted from copra is rich in lauric acid, making it an important commodity in the preparation of lauryl alcohol, soaps, fatty acids, cosmetics, etc. and thus a lucrative product for many coconut-producing countries. The palatable oil cake, known as copra cake, obtained as a residue in the production of copra oil is used in animal feeds. The ground cake is known as coconut or copra meal.[2]","image":"Copra_full.JPG.webp","url":"Copra"}
