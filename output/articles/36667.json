{"title":"Quackery","summary":"Quackery, often synonymous with health fraud, is the promotion[1] of fraudulent or ignorant medical practices. A quack is a \"fraudulent or ignorant pretender to medical skill\" or \"a person who pretends, professionally or publicly, to have skill, knowledge, qualification or credentials they do not possess; a charlatan or snake oil salesman\".[2] The term quack is a clipped form of the archaic term quacksalver, from Dutch: kwakzalver a \"hawker of salve\".[3] In the Middle Ages the term quack meant \"shouting\". The quacksalvers sold their wares on the market shouting in a loud voice.[4]","image":"WPA_quack_poster.jpg.webp","url":"Quackery"}
