{"title":"Matrix exponential","summary":"In mathematics, the matrix exponential is a matrix function on square matrices analogous to the ordinary exponential function. It is used to solve systems of linear differential equations. In the theory of Lie groups, the matrix exponential gives the connection between a matrix Lie algebra and the corresponding Lie group.","image":"8a51cff6614a7f85edea3a64e83231d4c4b307cc.svg"}
