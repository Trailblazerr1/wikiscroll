{"title":"John B. Fenn","summary":"John Bennett Fenn (June 15, 1917 – December 10, 2010) was an American professor of analytical chemistry who was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002.  Fenn shared half of the award with Koichi Tanaka for their work in mass spectrometry.  The other half of the 2002 award went to Kurt Wüthrich. Fenn's contributions specifically related to the development of electrospray ionization, now a commonly used technique for large molecules and routine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.  Early in his career, Fenn did research in the field of jet propulsion at Project SQUID, and focused on molecular beam studies.  Fenn finished his career with more than 100 publications, including one book.","image":"John_B_Fenn01.jpg.webp"}
