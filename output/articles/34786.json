{"title":"Philipp Lenard","summary":"Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard (German pronunciation: [ˈfɪlɪp ˈleːnaʁt] (listen); Hungarian: Lénárd Fülöp Eduárd Antal; 7 June 1862 – 20 May 1947) was a Hungarian-born German physicist and the winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905 for his work on cathode rays and the discovery of many of their properties. One of his most important contributions was the experimental realization of the photoelectric effect. He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons ejected from a cathode depends only on the wavelength, and not the intensity, of the incident light.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
