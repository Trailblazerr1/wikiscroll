{"title":"Hippocampus","summary":"The hippocampus (via Latin from Greek ἱππόκαμπος, 'seahorse') is a major component of the brain of humans and other vertebrates. Humans and other mammals have two hippocampi, one in each side of the brain. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, and plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory, and in spatial memory that enables navigation. The hippocampus is located in the allocortex, with neural projections into the neocortex in humans,[1][2][3] as well as primates.[4]  The hippocampus, as the medial pallium, is a structure found in all vertebrates.[5] In humans, it contains two main interlocking parts: the hippocampus proper (also called Ammon's horn)[6] and the dentate gyrus.","image":"Gray739-emphasizing-hippocampus.png.webp","url":"Hippocampus"}
