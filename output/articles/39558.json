{"title":"Scale (anatomy)","summary":"In most biological nomenclature, a scale (Ancient Greek: λεπίς, romanized: lepís; Latin: squāma) is a small rigid plate that grows out of an animal's skin to provide protection. In lepidopteran (butterfly and moth) species, scales are plates on the surface of the insect wing, and provide coloration. Scales are quite common and have evolved multiple times through convergent evolution, with varying structure and function.","image":"Keeled_scales_on_a_southern_watersnake_(26954310414).jpg.webp"}
