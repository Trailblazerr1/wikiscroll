{"title":"Motion Picture Production Code","summary":"The Motion Picture Production Code was a set of industry guidelines for the self-censorship of content that was applied to most United States motion pictures released by major studios from 1934 to 1968. It is also popularly known as the Hays Code, after Will H. Hays, who was the president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA) from 1922 to 1945. Under Hays's leadership, the MPPDA, later known as the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and now simply the Motion Picture Association (MPA), adopted the Production Code in 1930 and began rigidly enforcing it in mid-1934. The Production Code spelled out what was acceptable and  unacceptable content for motion pictures produced for a public audience in the United States.","image":"Motion_Picture_Production_Code.png.webp"}
