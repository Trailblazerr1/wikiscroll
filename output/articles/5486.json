{"title":"Bangerz","summary":"Bangerz is the fourth studio album by American singer Miley Cyrus. It was released on September 30, 2013, by RCA Records. It is her first studio album since 2010's Can't Be Tamed. Opting to re-establish her music career instead of focusing on her acting career as originally planned, Cyrus began planning the project in late 2012. Work continued into 2013 when she signed with RCA Records. Described by Cyrus as \"dirty south hip-hop\", Bangerz represents a musical departure from her earlier works, which she had grown to feel \"disconnected\" from. As executive producers, Cyrus and Mike Will Made It collaborated with hip hop producers including Pharrell Williams, Oren Yoel, Rami Samir Afuni, Dr. Luke, and Michael McHenry. Their efforts resulted in a primarily pop and R&B record, with lyrical themes that revolve largely around romance. It features guest vocals from several new partners, including pop singer Britney Spears and rappers Big Sean, French Montana, Future, Ludacris, and Nelly. Cyrus co-wrote 12 out of 16 tracks.","image":"Bangerz.png.webp"}
