{"title":"Switchblade","summary":"A switchblade (shortened switch, but also known as an automatic knife, pushbutton knife, ejector knife, spring knife (Sprenger,[1] Springer[2][3]), flick knife, or flick blade) is a type of knife with a sliding blade contained in the handle which is extended automatically by a spring when a button, lever, or switch on the handle or bolster is activated. Most switchblade designs incorporate a locking blade, in which the blade is locked against closure when the blade is extended to the fully opened position. It is unlocked by a mechanism that allows the blade to be folded and locked in the closed position.","image":"Switchblade_animated.gif"}
