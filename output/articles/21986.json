{"title":"Infrasound","summary":"Infrasound, sometimes referred to as low-frequency sound, describes sound waves with a frequency below the lower limit of human audibility (generally 20Â Hz). Hearing becomes gradually less sensitive as frequency decreases, so for humans to perceive infrasound, the sound pressure must be sufficiently high. The ear is the primary organ for sensing low sound, but at higher intensities it is possible to feel infrasound vibrations in various parts of the body.","image":"Infrasound_Arrays.jpg.webp"}
