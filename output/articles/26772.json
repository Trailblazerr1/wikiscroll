However excluding the pegged (fixed exchange rate) currencies, there are only 130 currencies (which are independent or pegged to a currency basket). Dependencies and unrecognized states are listed here only if another currency is used in their territory that is different from the one of the state that administers them or has jurisdiction over them.","image":"NagornoKarabakhP1-2-Dram-2004-donatedta_b.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_circulating_currencies"}
