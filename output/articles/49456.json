{"title":"Zeros and poles","summary":"In complex analysis (a branch of mathematics), a pole is a certain type of singularity of a function, nearby which the function behaves relatively regularly, in contrast to essential singularities, such as 0 for the logarithm function, and branch points, such as 0 for the complex square root function.","image":"Gamma_abs_3D.png.webp","url":"Zeros_and_poles"}
