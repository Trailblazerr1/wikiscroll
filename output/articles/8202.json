{"title":"Calamity Jane","summary":"Martha Jane Cannary (May 1, 1852 â€“ August 1, 1903), better known as Calamity Jane, was a well-known American frontierswoman, sharpshooter, and raconteur.[1][2][3] In addition to many exploits she was known for being an acquaintance of Wild Bill Hickok. Late in her life, she appeared in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show and at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition. She is said to have exhibited compassion to others, especially to the sick and needy. This facet of her character contrasted with her daredevil ways and helped to make her a noted frontier figure.[4] She was also known for her habit of wearing men's attire.[5]","image":"Calamity_Jane_by_CE_Finn%2C_c1880s-crop1.jpg.webp","url":"Calamity_Jane"}
