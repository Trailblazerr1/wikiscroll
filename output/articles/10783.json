{"title":"Complex instruction set computer","summary":"A complex instruction set computer (CISC /ˈsɪsk/) is a computer architecture in which single instructions can execute several low-level operations (such as a load from memory, an arithmetic operation, and a memory store) or are capable of multi-step operations or addressing modes within single instructions. The term was retroactively coined in contrast to reduced instruction set computer (RISC)[1] and has therefore become something of an umbrella term for everything that is not RISC, where the typical differentiating characteristic is that most RISC designs use uniform instruction length for almost all instructions, and employ strictly separate load and store instructions.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
