{"title":"Smith (surname)","summary":"Smith is a surname[3] originating in England and Ireland. It is the most prevalent surname in the United Kingdom,[1][4] the United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand,[5] and the fifth most common surname in the Republic of Ireland. The surname Smith is particularly prevalent among those of English, Scottish, and Irish descent,[6] but is also a common surname among African Americans, which can be attributed either to black slaves having been given the surname of their masters, or to being an occupational name, as some southern American black people took this surname to reflect their or their father's trade.[7] 2,442,977 Americans shared the surname Smith at the time of the 2010 census,[8] and more than 500,000 people shared it in the United Kingdom as of 2006.[9] At the turn of the 20th century, the surname was sufficiently prevalent in England to have prompted the statement: \"Common to every village in England, north, south, east, and west\";[10] and sufficiently common on the (European) continent (in various forms) to be \"common in most countries of Europe\".[11]","image":"Blacksmith_at_work02.jpg.webp"}
