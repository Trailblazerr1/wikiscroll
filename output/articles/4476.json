{"title":"Art pop","summary":"Art pop (also typeset as art-pop or artpop) is a loosely defined style of pop music[1] influenced by pop art's integration of high and low culture, and which emphasizes the manipulation of signs, style, and gesture over personal expression.[6][7] Art pop artists may be inspired by postmodern approaches or art theories[6] as well as other forms of art, such as fashion, fine art, cinema, and avant-garde literature.[3][8] They may deviate from traditional pop audiences and rock music conventions,[9] instead exploring ideas such as pop's status as commercial art, notions of artifice and the self, and questions of historical authenticity.","image":"Warhol's_Exploding_Plastic_Inevitable_with_Nico.png.webp"}
