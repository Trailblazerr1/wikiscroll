{"title":"Manaslu","summary":"Manaslu (Nepali: मनास्लु, also known as Kutang) is the eighth-highest mountain in the world at 8,163 metres (26,781 ft) above sea level. It is in the Mansiri Himal, part of the Nepalese Himalayas, in the west-central part of Nepal. The name Manaslu means \"mountain of the spirit\" and is derived from the Sanskrit word manasa, meaning \"intellect\" or \"soul\". Manaslu was first climbed on May 9, 1956, by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition. It is said that, given the many unsuccessful attempts by the British to climb Everest before New Zealander Edmund Hilary, \"just as the British consider Everest their mountain, Manaslu has always been a Japanese mountain\".[4][5]","image":"Manaslu_Peak.jpg.webp","url":"Manaslu"}
