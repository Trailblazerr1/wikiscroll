{"title":"Black Sea","summary":"The Black Sea is a marginal mediterranean sea of the Atlantic Ocean lying between Europe and Asia; east of the Balkan Peninsula (Southeast Europe), south of the East European Plain in Eastern Europe, west of the Caucasus, and north of Anatolia in Western Asia. It is supplied by major rivers, principally the Danube, Dnieper, and Don. The watersheds of many countries drain into the sea beyond the six that share its coast.[2]","image":"Black_Sea_map.png.webp"}
