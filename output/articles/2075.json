{"title":"Acropolis of Athens","summary":"The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical significance, the most famous being the Parthenon.  The word  acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον (akron, \"highest point, extremity\") and πόλις (polis, \"city\").[1] The term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece. During ancient times it was known also more properly as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the supposed first Athenian king.","image":"The_Acropolis_of_Athens_viewed_from_the_Hill_of_the_Muses_(14220794964).jpg.webp","url":"Acropolis_of_Athens"}
