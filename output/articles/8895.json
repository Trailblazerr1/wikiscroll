{"title":"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia","summary":"Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited genetic disorder that predisposes those affected to potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. The arrhythmias seen in CPVT typically occur during exercise or at times of emotional stress, and classically take the form of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Those affected may be asymptomatic, but they may also experience blackouts or even sudden cardiac death.","image":"ECG000033_(CardioNetworks_ECGpedia).jpg.webp","url":"Catecholaminergic_polymorphic_ventricular_tachycardia"}
