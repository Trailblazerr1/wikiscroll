{"title":"Climate change in Africa","summary":"Climate change in Africa is an increasingly serious threat for Africans as Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to climate change.[1][2] Anthropogenic climate change is already a reality in Africa, as it is elsewhere in the world. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,  the vulnerability of Africa to climate change is driven by a range of factors that include weak adaptive capacity, high dependence on ecosystem goods for livelihoods, and less developed agricultural production systems.[3] The risks of climate change on agricultural production, food security, water resources and ecosystem services will likely have increasingly severe consequences on lives and sustainable development prospects in Africa.[4] Managing this risk requires an integration of mitigation and adaptation strategies in the management of ecosystem goods and services, and the agriculture production systems in Africa.[5]","image":"Climate_smart_agriculture_in_Machakos_county_(15640332182).jpg.webp"}
