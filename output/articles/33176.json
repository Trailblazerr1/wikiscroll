{"title":"Optical mouse","summary":"An optical mouse is a computer mouse which uses a light source, typically a light-emitting diode (LED), and a light detector, such as an array of photodiodes, to detect movement relative to a surface. Variations of the optical mouse have largely replaced the older mechanical mouse design, which uses moving parts to sense motion.","image":"Microsoft-wireless-mouse.jpg.webp","url":"Optical_mouse"}
