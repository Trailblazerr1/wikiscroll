{"title":"Salade niçoise","summary":"Salade niçoise (French pronunciation: ​[saˈlad niˈswaz]), salada nissarda in the Niçard dialect of the Occitan language, insalata nizzarda in Italian, is a salad that originated in the French city of Nice.  It is traditionally made of tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, Niçoise olives and anchovies or tuna, dressed with olive oil, or in some historical versions, a vinaigrette. It has been popular worldwide since the early 20th century, and has been prepared and discussed by many chefs. Delia Smith called it \"one of the best combinations of salad ingredients ever invented\"[1] and Gordon Ramsay said that \"it must be the finest summer salad of all\".[2]","image":"Nizza-Salat_an_der_F_Mittelmeerküste.JPG.webp","url":"Salade_niçoise"}
