{"title":"Solenoid","summary":"A solenoid (/ˈsoʊlənɔɪd/,[1]) is a type of electromagnet, the purpose of which is to generate a controlled magnetic field through a coil wound into a tightly packed helix. The coil can be arranged to produce a uniform magnetic field in a volume of space when an electric current is passed through it. The term solenoid was coined in 1823 by André-Marie Ampère to designate a helical coil.[2]","image":"Solenoid-1.png.webp"}
