{"title":"Embryophyte","summary":"The Embryophyta (/ˌɛmbriˈɒfətə, -oʊˈfaɪtə/), or land plants, are the most familiar group of green plants that comprise vegetation on Earth. Embryophyta is a clade within the Phragmoplastophyta, a larger clade that also includes several groups of green algae including the Charophyceae and Coleochaetales. Within this larger clade the embryophytes (/ˈɛmbriəˌfaɪts/) are sister to the Zygnematophyceae/Mesotaeniaceae and consist of the bryophytes plus the polysporangiophytes.[12] Living embryophytes therefore include hornworts, liverworts, mosses,  lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms and flowering plants.","image":"Plants.jpg.webp"}
