{"title":"Compact space","summary":"In mathematics, specifically general topology, compactness is a property that generalizes the notion of a subset of Euclidean space being closed (containing all its limit points) and bounded (having all its points lie within some fixed distance of each other).[1] Examples of compact spaces include a closed real interval, a union of a finite number of closed intervals, a rectangle, or a finite set of points. This notion is defined for more general topological spaces in various ways, which are usually equivalent in Euclidean space but may be inequivalent in other spaces.","image":"Compact.svg.png.webp","url":"Compact_space"}
