{"title":"Xylem","summary":"Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, the other being phloem. The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports nutrients.[1][2] The word xylem is derived from the Ancient Greek word ξύλον (xylon), meaning \"wood\"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout a plant.[3] The term was introduced by Carl Nägeli in 1858.[4][5]","image":"Xylem_and_phloem_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
