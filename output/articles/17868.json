{"title":"Georgetown Car Barn","summary":"The Georgetown Car Barn, historically known as the Capital Traction Company Union Station, is a building in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., in the United States. Designed by the architect Waddy Butler Wood, it was built between 1895 and 1897 by the Capital Traction Company as a union terminal for several Washington and Virginia streetcar lines. The adjacent Exorcist steps, later named after their appearance in William Friedkin's 1973 horror film The Exorcist, were built during the initial construction to connect M Street with Prospect Street.","image":"Georgetown_Car_Barn%2C_Georgetown%2C_Washington%2C_DC_(39641670263).jpg.webp","url":"Georgetown_Car_Barn"}
