{"title":"Laplace transform","summary":"In mathematics, the Laplace transform, named after its inventor Pierre-Simon Laplace (/ləˈplɑːs/), is an integral transform that converts a function of a real variable t {\\displaystyle t} (often time) to a function of a complex variable s {\\displaystyle s} (complex frequency). The transform has many applications in science and engineering because it is a tool for solving differential equations. In particular, it transforms linear differential equations into algebraic equations and convolution into multiplication.[1][2]","image":"65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560.svg","url":"Laplace_transform"}
