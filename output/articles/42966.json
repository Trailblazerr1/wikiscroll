{"title":"Suzuki Carry","summary":"The Suzuki Carry (スズキ・キャリイ, Suzuki Kyarī) is a kei truck produced by the Japanese automaker Suzuki. The microvan version was originally called the Carry van until 1982 when the passenger van versions were renamed as the Suzuki Every (スズキ・エブリイ, Suzuki Eburī). In Japan, the Carry and Every are kei cars but the Suzuki Every Plus, the bigger version of Every, had a longer bonnet for safety purposes and a larger 1.3-liter 86-hp (63 kW) four-cylinder engine. They have been sold under myriad different names in several countries, including those with Chevrolet and Ford badges.[1]","image":"Suzuki_Carry_Truck_KC_4WD_DA16T.JPG.webp"}
