{"title":"Saiga antelope","summary":"The saiga antelope (/ˈsaɪɡə/, Saiga tatarica), or saiga,  is a critically endangered antelope which during antiquity inhabited a vast area of the Eurasian steppe spanning the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in the northwest and Caucasus in the southwest into Mongolia in the northeast and Dzungaria in the southeast. During the Pleistocene, they also occurred in Beringian North America and the British Isles. Today, the dominant subspecies (S. t. tatarica) is only found in one region in Russia (in the Republic of Kalmykia and Astrakhan Oblast) and three areas in Kazakhstan (the Ural, Ustiurt, and Betpak-Dala populations). A portion of the Ustiurt population migrates south to Uzbekistan and occasionally Turkmenistan in winter. It is extirpated from China and southwestern Mongolia. The Mongolian subspecies (S. t. mongolica) is found only in western Mongolia.[3][4]","image":"Saiga_antelope_at_the_Stepnoi_Sanctuary.jpg.webp","url":"Saiga_antelope"}
