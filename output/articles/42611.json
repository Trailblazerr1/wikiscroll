{"title":"Substantia nigra","summary":"The substantia nigra (SN) is a basal ganglia structure located in the midbrain that plays an important role in reward and movement. Substantia nigra is Latin for \"black substance\", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of neuromelanin in dopaminergic neurons.[1] Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the  substantia nigra pars compacta.[2]","image":"Substantia_nigra.gif","url":"Substantia_nigra"}
