{"title":"Viscoelasticity","summary":"In materials science and continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity is the property of materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. Viscous materials, like water, resist shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. Elastic materials strain when stretched and immediately return to their original state once the stress is removed.","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg","url":"Viscoelasticity"}
