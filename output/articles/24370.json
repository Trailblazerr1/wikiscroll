{"title":"Kaposi's sarcoma","summary":"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that can form masses in the skin, in lymph nodes, in the mouth, or in other organs.[4][6] The skin lesions are usually painless, purple and may be flat or raised.[6][8] Lesions can occur singly, multiply in a limited area, or may be widespread.[6] Depending on the sub-type of disease and level of immune suppression, KS may worsen either gradually or quickly.[6] KS is caused by a combination of immune suppression (such as due to HIV/AIDS) and infection by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8 - also called KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)).[8]","image":"Kaposis_sarcoma_01.jpg.webp","url":"Kaposi's_sarcoma"}
