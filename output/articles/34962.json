He was the first person to declare himself an anarchist,[9][10] using that term, and is widely regarded as one of anarchism's most influential theorists. Proudhon is considered by many to be the \"father of anarchism\".[11] Proudhon became a member of the French Parliament after the Revolution of 1848, whereafter he referred to himself as a federalist.[12] Proudhon described the liberty he pursued as \"the synthesis of communism and property\".[13] Some consider his mutualism to be part of individualist anarchism[14][15][16] while others regard it to be part of social anarchism.[17][18][19]","image":"Portrait_of_Pierre_Joseph_Proudhon_1865.jpg.webp","url":"Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon"}
