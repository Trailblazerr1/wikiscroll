{"title":"USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center","summary":"The USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is a stadium complex within Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, United States. It has been the home of the US Open Grand Slam tennis tournament, played every year in August and September, since 1978 and is operated by the United States Tennis Association (USTA).[1] The facility has 22 courts inside its 46.5 acres (0.188 km2; 0.0727 sq mi)[2] and 12 in the adjoining park. The complex's three stadiums are among the largest tennis stadiums in the world; Arthur Ashe Stadium tops the global list with a listed capacity of 23,200.[3] All 33 courts used the DecoTurf cushioned acrylic surface since the facility was built in 1978. However, in March 2020, the USTA announced that Laykold would become the new court surface supplier beginning with the 2020 tournament.[4]","image":"USTA_Billie_Jean_King_National_Tennis_Center_(48613535076).jpg.webp","url":"USTA_Billie_Jean_King_National_Tennis_Center"}
