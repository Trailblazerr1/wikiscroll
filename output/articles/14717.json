{"title":"Emoji","summary":"An emoji (/ɪˈmoʊdʒiː/ i-MOH-jee; plural emoji or emojis[1]) is a pictogram, logogram, ideogram or smiley embedded in text and used in electronic messages and web pages. The primary function of emoji is to fill in emotional cues otherwise missing from typed conversation.[2] Some examples of emoji are 😂, 😃, 🧘🏻‍♂️, 🌍, 🍞, 🚗, 📞,  🎉, ❤️, 🍆, and 🏁. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals. They are much like emoticons, but emoji are pictures rather than typographic approximations; the term \"emoji\" in the strict sense refers to such pictures which can be represented as encoded characters, but it is sometimes applied to messaging stickers by extension.[3] Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (絵, 'picture') + moji (文字, 'character'); the resemblance to the English words emotion and emoticon is purely coincidental.[4] The ISO 15924 script code for emoji is Zsye.","image":"Twemoji_1f600.svg.png.webp"}
