{"title":"Pashtuns","summary":"Pashtuns (/ˈpʌʃˌtʊn/, /ˈpɑːʃˌtʊn/ or /ˈpæʃˌtuːn/; Pashto: پښتانه‎, Pəx̌tānə́;[24] Pakhtuns[25] or Pathans[lower-alpha 1]), historically known as Afghans [lower-alpha 2] are an Iranian[34][35][36][37] ethnic group native to Central and South Asia.[38] The ethnic group's native language is Pashto, an Eastern Iranian language. Additionally, ethnic Pashtuns in Afghanistan also speak Dari[39] dialect of Persian as a second language,[40][41] while those in the Indian subcontinent use Hindi-Urdu as a second language.[42][43] However, a significant minority speaks Persian or Hindi-Urdu as their first language.[44] The total number of Pashtuns is estimated to be around 49 million;[1] however, this figure is disputed, because of the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979.[45]","image":"Tribal_and_religious_leaders_in_southern_Afghanistan.jpg.webp","url":"Pashtuns"}
