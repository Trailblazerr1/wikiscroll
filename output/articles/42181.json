{"title":"Steak tartare","summary":"Steak tartare is a meat dish made from raw ground (minced) beef[1][2] or horse meat.[3] It is usually served with onions, capers, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and other seasonings, often presented to the diner separately, to be added for taste. It is often served with a raw egg yolk on top of the dish. It is somewhat similar to Çiğ köfte, which is another Turkic dish made from minced raw meat.","image":"Classic_steak_tartare.jpg.webp"}
