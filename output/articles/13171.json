{"title":"Dissolution of the Soviet Union","summary":"The dissolution of the Soviet Union[lower-alpha 8] (1988â€“1991) was the process of internal political, economical and ethnical disintegration within the USSR as an untoward result of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's effort of political and economic reform of the Soviet authoritarian system and declining planned economy, which resulted in the end of its existence as a sovereign state. After a 1991 military coup attempt in Moscow led to a complete disintegration of the country, Gorbachev had to first retire as leader of the Communist Party since it practically ceased to work, then to resign his office as president and what was left of the parliament to formally acknowledge the Union's collapse as a fait accompli.","image":"Lowering_the_Soviet_Flag.png.webp","url":"Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union"}
