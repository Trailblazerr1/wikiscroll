{"title":"Cooperative game theory","summary":"In game theory, a cooperative game (or coalitional game) is a game with competition between groups of players (\"coalitions\") due to the possibility of external enforcement of cooperative behavior (e.g. through contract law). Those are opposed to non-cooperative games in which there is either no possibility to forge alliances or all agreements need to be self-enforcing (e.g. through credible threats).[1]","image":"f5e3890c981ae85503089652feb48b191b57aae3.svg"}
