{"title":"Georg Solti","summary":"Sir Georg Solti, KBE (/ˈdʒɔːrdʒ ˈʃɒlti/;[1] Hungarian: [ˈʃolti]; born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997)[2] was a Hungarian-born British orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics and, being of Jewish background, he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist.","image":"Sir_George_Solti_6_Allan_Allan_Warren.jpg.webp"}
