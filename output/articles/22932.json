{"title":"James II of England","summary":"James II and VII (14 October 1633O.S. – 16 September 1701[lower-alpha 1]) was King of England and King of Ireland as James II, and King of Scotland as James VII[4] from the death of his elder brother, Charles II, on 6 February 1685. He was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. He was the last Catholic monarch of England, Scotland, and Ireland. His reign is now remembered primarily for struggles over religious tolerance, however, it also involved struggles over the principles of absolutism and the divine right of kings. His deposition ended a century of political and civil strife by confirming the primacy of Parliament over the Crown.[5]","image":"James_II_by_Peter_Lely.jpg.webp"}
