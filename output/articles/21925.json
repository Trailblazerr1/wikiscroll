{"title":"Industrial music","summary":"Industrial music is a genre of music that draws on harsh, transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. AllMusic defines industrial music as the \"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\" that was \"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concr√®te, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\".[2] The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by members of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza. While the genre name originated with Throbbing Gristle's emergence in the United Kingdom, artists and labels vital to the genre also emerged in the United States and other countries.","image":"Frank_Zappa_-_Capt._Beefheart.jpg.webp"}
