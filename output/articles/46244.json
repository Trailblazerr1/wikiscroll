{"title":"Twin","summary":"Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy.[1] Twins can be either monozygotic ('identical'), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic ('non-identical' or 'fraternal'), meaning that each twin develops from a separate egg and each egg is fertilized by its own sperm cell.[2] In rare cases twins can have the same mother and different fathers (heteropaternal superfecundation).","image":"Mark_and_Scott_Kelly_at_the_Johnson_Space_Center%2C_Houston_Texas.jpg.webp"}
