{"title":"Rioja (wine)","summary":"Rioja [ˈrjoxa] is a wine region in Spain, with denominación de origen calificada (D.O.Ca., \"Qualified Designation of Origin,\" the highest category in Spanish wine regulation). Rioja wine is made from grapes grown in the autonomous communities of La Rioja and Navarre, and the Basque province of Álava. Rioja is further subdivided into three zones: Rioja Alta, Rioja Oriental and Rioja Alavesa. Many wines have traditionally blended fruit from all three regions, though there is a slow growth in single-zone wines.","image":"DOCa_Rioja_location.svg.png.webp"}
