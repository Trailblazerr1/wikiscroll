{"title":"White trash","summary":"White trash is a derogatory racial and class-related slur[1][2] used in American English to refer to poor white people, especially in the rural southern United States. The label signifies a social class inside the white population and especially a degraded standard of living.[3]  It is used as a way to separate the \"noble and hardworking\" \"good poor\" from the lazy, \"undisciplined, ungrateful and disgusting\" \"bad poor\".  Use of the term provides for middle- and upper-class whites a means of distancing themselves from the poverty and powerlessness of poor whites, members of a privileged class – whites – who cannot enjoy those privileges.[1]","image":"The_10%2C000_Hookworm_Family.jpg.webp","url":"White_trash"}
