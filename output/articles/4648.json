{"title":"Asperger syndrome","summary":"Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.[7] It is an autism spectrum disorder (ASD),[12] but differs from other ASDs by relatively unimpaired language and intelligence.[13] The syndrome is named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others' gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favourite interests, and were clumsy.[14] Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common.[15][16] Signs usually begin before two years of age and in many cases never resolve.[7]","image":"Riboflavin_penicillinamide.jpg.webp","url":"Asperger_syndrome"}
