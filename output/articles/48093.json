{"title":"We Belong Together","summary":"\"We Belong Together\" is a song by American singer Mariah Carey from her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi (2005). The song was released on March 14, 2005, through Island Records, as the second single from the album. \"We Belong Together\" was written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Manuel Seal, and Johnt√° Austin, and produced by the former three. Since the song interpolates lyrics from Bobby Womack's \"If You Think You're Lonely Now\" (1981) and the Deele's \"Two Occasions\" (1987), the songwriters of those respective songs are credited. \"We Belong Together\" is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat. The lyrics chronicle a woman's desperation for her former lover to return.","image":"We_Belong_Together_Mariah_Carey.png.webp","url":"We_Belong_Together"}
