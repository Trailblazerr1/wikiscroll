{"title":"Top hat","summary":"A top hat (also called a high hat, a cylinder hat, or a topper[1]) is a tall, flat-crowned hat for men traditionally associated with formal wear in Western dress codes, meaning white tie, morning dress, or frock coat. Traditionally made of black silk or sometimes grey, the top hat emerged in Western fashion by the end of the 18th century. Although it declined by the time of the counterculture of the 1960s, it remains a formal fashion accessory. A collapsible variant of a top hat, developed in the 19th century, is known as an opera hat.","image":"1910_top_hat.jpg.webp","url":"Top_hat"}
