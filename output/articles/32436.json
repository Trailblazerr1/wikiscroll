{"title":"Northern storm petrel","summary":"Northern storm petrels are seabirds in the genus Hydrobates in the family Hydrobatidae, part of the order Procellariiformes. The family was once lumped with the similar austral storm petrels in the combined storm petrels, but have been split, as they were not closely related. These smallest of seabirds feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.","image":"European_Storm_Petrel_From_The_Crossley_ID_Guide_Eastern_Birds.jpg.webp"}
