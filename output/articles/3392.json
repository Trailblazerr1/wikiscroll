{"title":"Amphitrite","summary":"In ancient Greek mythology, Amphitrite (/æmfɪˈtraɪtiː/; Greek: Ἀμφιτρίτη, translit. Amphitrítē) was a sea goddess and wife of Poseidon and the queen of the sea.[1] She was a daughter of Nereus and Doris (or Oceanus and Tethys).[2] Under the influence of the Olympian pantheon, she became the consort of Poseidon and was later used as a symbolic representation of the sea. In Roman mythology, the consort of Neptune, a comparatively minor figure, was Salacia, the goddess of saltwater.[3]","image":"Cirta_mosaic.jpg.webp"}
