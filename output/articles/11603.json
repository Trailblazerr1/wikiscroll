{"title":"Cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator","summary":"A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG)[1] is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is also loosely known as a cryptographic random number generator (CRNG) (see Random number generation ยง \"True\" vs. pseudo-random numbers).[2][3]","image":"0456d0a7b184626390727b977234952fc44e13de.svg"}
