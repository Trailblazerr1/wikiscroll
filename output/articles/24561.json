{"title":"Kelpie","summary":"A kelpie, or water kelpie, is a shape-shifting spirit inhabiting lochs in Scottish folklore. It is a Celtic legend; however, analogues exist in other cultures. It is usually described as a black horse-like creature, able to adopt human form. Some accounts state that the kelpie retains its hooves when appearing as a human, leading to its association with the Christian idea of Satan as alluded to by Robert Burns in his 1786 poem \"Address to the Devil\".","image":"Thekelpie_large.jpg.webp","url":"Kelpie"}
