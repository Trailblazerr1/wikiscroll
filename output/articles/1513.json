{"title":"Shatt al-Arab","summary":"The Shatt al-Arab (Arabic: شط العرب‎, River of the Arabs), Locally known as Dijla Al-Awara (Arabic: دجلة العوراء‎),[1] also known as Arvand Rud in Iran (Persian: اروندرود‎, Swift River), is a river of some 200 km (120 mi) in length formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and the Tigris in the town of al-Qurnah in the Basra Governorate of southern Iraq. The southern end of the river constitutes the  border between Iraq and Iran down to the mouth of the river where it discharges into the Persian Gulf. The Shatt al-Arab varies in width from about 232 metres (761 ft) at Basra to 800 metres (2,600 ft) at its mouth. It is thought that the waterway formed relatively recently in geologic time (see below), with the Tigris and Euphrates originally emptying into the Persian Gulf via a channel further to the west.","image":"Shat_al-arab-22.JPG.webp","url":"A%2fShatt_al-Arab"}
