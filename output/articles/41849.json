{"title":"Squamous cell skin cancer","summary":"Squamous-cell skin cancer, also known as cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC), is one of the main types of skin cancer along with basal cell cancer and melanoma.[10] It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but can also form an ulcer.[1] Onset is often over months.[4] Squamous-cell skin cancer is more likely to spread to distant areas than basal cell cancer.[11] When confined to the outermost layer of the skin, a precancerous or in situ form of cSCC is known as Bowen's disease.[12][13]","image":"Squamous_Cell_Carcinoma.jpg.webp","url":"Squamous_cell_skin_cancer"}
