{"title":"House music","summary":"House is a genre of electronic dance music characterized by a repetitive  four-on-the-floor beat and a typical tempo of 120 to 130 beats per minute.[10] It was created by DJs and music producers from Chicago's underground club culture in the 1980s, as DJs from the subculture began altering disco songs to give them a more mechanical beat and deeper basslines.[1]","image":"Honorary_Frankie_Knuckles_Way.jpg.webp"}
