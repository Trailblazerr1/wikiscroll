{"title":"Chronic wasting disease","summary":"Chronic wasting disease (CWD), sometimes called zombie deer disease, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting deer. TSEs are a family of diseases thought to be caused by misfolded proteins called prions and include similar diseases such as BSE (mad cow disease) in cattle, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and scrapie in sheep.[1] In the US, CWD affects mule deer, white-tailed deer, red deer, sika deer, elk, caribou, and moose.[2] Natural infection causing CWD affects members of the deer family.[2] Experimental transmission of CWD to other species such as squirrel monkeys, and genetically modified mice has been shown.[3]","image":"Deer1_tkreeger.jpg.webp"}
