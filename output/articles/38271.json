{"title":"Rock and Roll (dance)","summary":"Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll is a very athletic, competitive form of partner dance that originated from lindy hop. Unlike lindy hop, however, it is a choreographed dance designed for performance. It is danced by both couples (usually of mixed gender) and groups, either all-female or four to eight couples together.  This is normally a very fast and physically demanding dance.","image":"Rocknroll-dancing-somersault-worldgames2005.jpg.webp","url":"Rock_and_Roll_(dance)"}
