{"title":"Wittig reaction","summary":"The Wittig reaction or Wittig olefination is a chemical reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a triphenyl phosphonium ylide called a Wittig reagent.   Wittig reactions are most commonly used to convert aldehydes and ketones to alkenes.[1][2][3] Most often, the Wittig reaction is used to introduce a methylene group using methylenetriphenylphosphorane (Ph3P=CH2). Using this reagent, even a sterically hindered ketone such as camphor can be converted to its methylene derivative.","image":"Yes_check.svg.png.webp","url":"Wittig_reaction"}
