{"title":"Aortic regurgitation","summary":"Aortic regurgitation (AR), also known as aortic insufficiency (AI), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.[4]","image":"Blausen_0039_AorticRegurgitation.png.webp"}
