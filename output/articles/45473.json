{"title":"Tonsillectomy","summary":"Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure in which both palatine tonsils are fully removed from the back of the throat.[1] The procedure is mainly performed for recurrent tonsillitis, throat infections and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).[1] For those with frequent throat infections, surgery results in 0.6 (95% confidence interval: 1.0 to 0.1) fewer sore throats in the following year, but there is no evidence of long term benefits.[1][2] In children with OSA it results in improved quality of life.[3]","image":"Tonsillectomy09.jpg.webp","url":"Tonsillectomy"}
