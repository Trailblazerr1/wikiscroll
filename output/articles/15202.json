{"title":"Eternal life (Christianity)","summary":"Eternal life traditionally refers to continued life after death, as outlined in Christian eschatology. The Apostles' Creed testifies: \"I believe... the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.\" In this view, eternal life commences after the second coming of Jesus and the resurrection of the dead, although in the New Testament's Johannine literature there are references to eternal life commencing in the earthly life of the believer, possibly indicating an inaugurated eschatology.","image":"The_Ladder_of_Divine_Ascent.jpg.webp"}
