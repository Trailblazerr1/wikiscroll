{"title":"Torres Strait Islanders","summary":"Torres Strait Islanders (/ˈtɒrɪs-/)[3] are the Indigenous peoples of the Torres Strait Islands, which are part of the state of Queensland, Australia. Ethnically distinct from the Aboriginal people of the rest of Australia, they are often grouped with them as Indigenous Australians. Today there are many more Torres Strait Islander people living in mainland Australia (nearly 28,000) than on the Islands (about 4,500).","image":"Queensland_State_Archives_5750_Villagers_with_Hon_J_C_Peterson_and_party_Poid_Torres_Strait_Island_June_1931.png.webp"}
