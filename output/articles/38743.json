{"title":"Run the World (Girls)","summary":"\"Run the World (Girls)\" is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé, from her fourth studio album 4 (2011), released as the lead single from the album on April 21, 2011. It was written by Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash and Beyoncé, while heavily sampling \"Pon de Floor\" by Major Lazer written by Nick \"Afrojack\" van de Wall, Wesley \"Diplo\" Pentz, David \"Switch\" Taylor and Adidja \"Vybz Kartel\" Palmer. Production was handled by Switch, The-Dream, Beyoncé, and Shea Taylor. The song's development was motivated by Beyoncé wanting to do something different: a mixture of different cultures and eras, a new sound, and a message which would give women strength. An unedited demo of the song, then thought to be titled \"Girls (Who Run the World)\", was leaked on the internet on April 18, 2011. \"Run the World\" premiered on US radio on April 21, 2011, and was digitally released the same day.","image":"Beyonce_-_Run_the_World_(Girls)_(single).png.webp"}
