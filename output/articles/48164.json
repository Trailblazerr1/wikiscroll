{"title":"Weibull distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the Weibull distribution /ˈwaɪbʊl/ is a continuous probability distribution. It is named after Swedish mathematician Waloddi Weibull, who described it in detail in 1951, although it was first identified by Fréchet (1927) and first applied by Rosin & Rammler (1933) to describe a particle size distribution.","image":"Weibull_PDF.svg.png.webp","url":"Weibull_distribution"}
