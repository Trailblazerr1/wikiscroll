{"title":"Maximum break","summary":"A maximum break (also known as a maximum, a 147, or orally, a one-four-seven) is the highest possible break in a single frame of snooker.[lower-alpha 1] A player compiles a maximum break by potting all 15 reds with 15 blacks for 120 points, followed by all six colours for a further 27 points. Compiling a maximum break is regarded as a particularly significant achievement in the game of snooker, and may be compared to a nine-dart finish in darts or a 300 game in ten-pin bowling.","image":"Ronnie_O'Sullivan_PHC_2011-1.png.webp","url":"Maximum_break"}
