{"title":"Ciliary muscle","summary":"The ciliary muscle is an intrinsic muscle of the eye formed as a ring of smooth muscle[3][4] in the eye's middle layer,   uvea or (vascular layer). It controls accommodation for viewing objects at varying distances and regulates the flow of aqueous humor into Schlemm's canal. It also changes the shape of the lens within the eye but not the size of the pupil[5] which is carried out by the sphincter pupillae muscle and dilator pupillae.","image":"Gray872.png.webp","url":"Ciliary_muscle"}
