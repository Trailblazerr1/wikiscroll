{"title":"Brooch","summary":"A brooch (/ˈbroʊtʃ/, also US: /ˈbruːtʃ/[1]) is a decorative jewelry item designed to be attached to garments, often to fasten them together. It is usually made of metal, often silver or gold or some other material. Brooches are frequently decorated with enamel or with gemstones and may be solely for ornament or serve a practical function as a clothes fastener. The earliest known brooches are from the Bronze Age. As fashions in brooches changed rather quickly, they are important chronological indicators. In archaeology, ancient European brooches are usually referred to by the Latin term fibula.","image":"Wing_Brooch_MET_DT108.jpg.webp","url":"Brooch"}
