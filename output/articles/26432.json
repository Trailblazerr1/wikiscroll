{"title":"List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions","summary":"Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform.[2] The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] The World Constructors' Championship is presented by the FIA to the most successful F1 constructor over the course of the season through a points system based on individual Grand Prix results. Constructors' Championship points are calculated by adding points scored in each race by any driver for that constructor.[4] Up until 1979, most seasons saw only the highest-scoring driver in each race for each constructor contributing points towards the Championship.[5] The Constructors' Championship is won when it is no longer mathematically possible for another constructor to overtake another's points total regardless of the outcome of the remaining races,[6] although it is not officially awarded until the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony held in various cities following the conclusion of the season.[7]","image":"Formula_One_constructors'_championship_trophy_2012-2013_Red_Bull_Racing.jpg.webp"}
