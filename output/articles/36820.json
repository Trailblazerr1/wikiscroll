{"title":"Quotient rule","summary":"In calculus, the quotient rule is a method of finding the derivative of a function that is the ratio of two differentiable functions.[1][2][3] Let f ( x ) = g ( x ) / h ( x ) , {\\displaystyle f(x)=g(x)/h(x),} where both g and h are differentiable and h ( x ) â‰  0. {\\displaystyle h(x)\\neq 0.} The quotient rule states that the derivative of f(x) is","image":"32c09374e27e60ad794bc86e5603705466ffc2b9.svg","url":"Quotient_rule"}
