{"title":"San Francisco City Hall","summary":"San Francisco City Hall is the seat of government for the City and County of San Francisco, California. Re-opened in 1915 in its open space area in the city's Civic Center, it is a Beaux-Arts monument to the City Beautiful movement that epitomized the high-minded American Renaissance of the 1880s to 1917. The structure's dome is taller than that of the United States Capitol by 42 feet (13Â m).[8]  The present building replaced an earlier City Hall that was destroyed during the 1906 earthquake, which was two blocks from the present one.","image":"San_Francisco_City_Hall_2.JPG.webp"}
