{"title":"Model organism","summary":"A model organism (often shortened to model) is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the model organism will provide insight into the workings of other organisms.[1][2] Model organisms are widely used to research human disease when human experimentation would be unfeasible or unethical.[3] This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms, and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genetic material over the course of evolution.[4]","image":"E_coli_at_10000x%2C_original.jpg.webp","url":"Model_organism"}
