{"title":"Post-occupation Japan","summary":"Post-occupation Japan is the period in postwar Japanese history which started when the Allied occupation of Japan ended in 1952 and lasted to the end of the Showa era in 1989. Despite the massive devastation it suffered in the Second World War, Japan established itself as a rich global economic power at peace with the world. In terms of political power it was more reluctant, especially in the nonuse of military force. The post-war constitution of 1946 included Article 9 clause, which restricted Japan from having a military force and engaging in war. However, it operates military forces, Japan Self-Defense Forces, since 1954. Over the years, the meaning of article 9 has been interpreted differently, because the United States now encourages Japan to control its own security and to join their military strategy more. The  Liberal Democratic Party would like to see the Constitution and Article 9 amended.[1]","image":"Signing_of_the_Peace_Treaty_8Yen_stamp.jpg.webp","url":"Post-occupation_Japan"}
