{"title":"Classical Chinese","summary":"Classical Chinese, also known as Literary Chinese[lower-alpha 1] (古文 gǔwén \"ancient text\", or 文言 wényán \"text speak\"; modern vernacular: 文言文 wényánwén \"text speak text\"), is the language of the classic literature from the end of the Spring and Autumn period through to the end of the Han dynasty, a written form of Old Chinese (上古漢語, shànɡɡǔ hànyǔ). Classical Chinese is a traditional style of written Chinese that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern spoken form of Chinese. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in China until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by written vernacular Chinese, a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken Mandarin Chinese, while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of their respective local vernaculars. Although languages have evolved in unique, different directions from the base of Literary Chinese, many cognates can be still found between these languages that have historically written in Classical Chinese.","image":"Shi_Jing.jpg.webp"}
