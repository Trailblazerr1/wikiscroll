{"title":"Covenant (biblical)","summary":"The Hebrew Bible makes reference to a number of covenants (Hebrew: בְּרִיתוֹת‎) with God (YHWH). These include the Noahic Covenant (in Genesis), which is between God and all living creatures, as well as a number of more specific covenants with Abraham, the whole Israelite people, the Israelite priesthood, and the Davidic lineage of kings. In form and terminology, these covenants echo the kinds of treaty agreements in the surrounding ancient world.","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp"}
