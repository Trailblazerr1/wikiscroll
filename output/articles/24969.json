{"title":"Knut (polar bear)","summary":"Knut (German pronunciation: [ˈknuːt] (listen); 5 December 2006 – 19 March 2011) was an orphaned polar bear born in captivity at the Berlin Zoological Garden.  Rejected by his mother at birth, he was raised by zookeepers.  He was the first polar bear cub to survive past infancy at the Berlin Zoo in more than 30 years.  At one time the subject of international controversy, he became a tourist attraction and commercial success.[1] After the German tabloid newspaper Bild ran a quote from an animal rights activist that decried keeping the cub in captivity, fans worldwide rallied in support of his being hand-raised by humans. Children protested outside the zoo, and e-mails and letters expressing sympathy for the cub's life were sent from around the world.","image":"Knut_IMG_8095.jpg.webp","url":"Knut_(polar_bear)"}
