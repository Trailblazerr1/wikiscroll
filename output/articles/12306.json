{"title":"de Havilland Mosquito","summary":"The de Havilland DH.98 Mosquito is a British twin-engined, shoulder-winged, multirole combat aircraft, introduced during the Second World War. Unusual in that its frame was constructed mostly of wood, it was nicknamed the \"Wooden Wonder\",[4] or \"Mossie\".[5] Lord Beaverbrook, Minister of Aircraft Production, nicknamed it \"Freeman's Folly\", alluding to Air Chief Marshal Sir Wilfrid Freeman, who defended Geoffrey de Havilland and his design concept against orders to scrap the project.[6] In 1941, it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world.[7]","image":"Mosquito_600pix.jpg.webp"}
