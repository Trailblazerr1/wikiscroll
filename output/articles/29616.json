{"title":"Miaphysitism","summary":"Miaphysitism is the Christological doctrine upheld by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, which include the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Syriac Orthodox Church, and the Armenian Apostolic Church. Rather than using the wording established at the Council of Chalcedon (451) that Jesus is one \"person\" (in Greek ὑπόστασις hypostasis) in two \"natures\" (in Greek φύσεις physeis), a divine nature and a human nature, they hold that Jesus, the \"Incarnate Word, is fully divine and fully human, in one \"nature\" (physis).\"[1] While historically a major point of controversy within Christianity, several modern declarations by both Chalcedonian and Miaphysite churches state that the difference between the two Christological formulations is essentially semantic and does not reflect any significant difference in belief about the nature of Christ.[2][3][4]","image":"ChristCopticArt.png.webp","url":"Miaphysitism"}
