{"title":"Brian Clough","summary":"Brian Howard Clough OBE[1] (/klʌf/ KLUF; 21 March 1935 – 20 September 2004) was an English football player and manager, being one of only four managers to have won the English league while managing two different clubs. He played as a striker and remains one of the Football League's highest goalscorers, but his career was shortened by a serious injury. As a manager, Clough's name is closely associated with that of Peter Taylor, who served as his assistant manager at various clubs in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. They achieved great successes with Derby County and Nottingham Forest. He is also remembered for giving frequent radio and television interviews in which he made controversial remarks about players, other managers and the overall state of the game.","image":"Aankomst_Nottingham_Forrest_op_Schiphol%2C_Ajax_1_tegenstanders_voor_de_Europa_Cup%2C_Bestanddeelnr_930-7831.jpg.webp"}
