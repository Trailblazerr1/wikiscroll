{"title":"Normans","summary":"The Normans (Norman: Normaunds; French: Normands; Latin: Nortmanni/Normanni) were a population arising in the medieval Duchy of Normandy from the intermingling between Norse Viking settlers and indigenous West Franks and Gallo-Romans.[1][2][3]  The term is also used to denote emigrants from the duchy who conquered other territories such as England and Sicily. The Norse settlements in West Francia followed a series of raids on the French northern coast mainly from Denmark, although some also sailed from Norway and Sweden. Said settlements were finally legitimized when Rollo, a Scandinavian viking leader, agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia following the siege of Chartres in 911 AD.[4] The intermingling in Normandy produced an ethnic and cultural \"Norman\" identity in the first half of the 10th century, an identity which continued to evolve over the centuries.[5]","image":"Bayeux_Tapestry_scene19_detail_Castle_Dinan.jpg.webp"}
