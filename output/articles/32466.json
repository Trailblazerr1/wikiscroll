{"title":"Notre-Dame de Paris fire","summary":"On 15 April 2019, just before 18:20 CEST, a fire broke out beneath the roof of Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral in Paris. By the time the structure fire was extinguished the building's spire had collapsed, most of its roof had been destroyed and its upper walls were severely damaged. Extensive damage to the interior was prevented by its stone vaulted ceiling, which largely contained the burning roof as it collapsed. Many works of art and religious relics were moved to safety early in the emergency, but others suffered smoke damage, and some of the exterior art was damaged or destroyed. The cathedral's altar, two pipe organs, and three 13th-century rose windows suffered little or no damage. Three emergency workers were injured. The fire resulted in the contamination of the site and nearby areas of the city with toxic dust and lead.[5]","image":"NotreDame20190415QuaideMontebello_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Notre-Dame_de_Paris_fire"}
