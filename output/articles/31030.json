{"title":"Myopia","summary":"Near-sightedness, also known as short-sightedness and myopia, is an eye disorder where light focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina.[1][2] This causes distant objects to appear blurry while close objects appear normal.[1] Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain.[1] Severe near-sightedness is associated with an increased risk of retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.[2]","image":"Myopia.gif","url":"Myopia"}
