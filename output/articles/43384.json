{"title":"Tank locomotive","summary":"A tank locomotive or tank engine is a steam locomotive that carries its water in one or more on-board water tanks, instead of a more traditional tender. Most tank engines also have bunkers (or fuel tanks) to hold fuel; in a tender-tank locomotive a tender holds some or all of the fuel, and may hold some water also.","image":"LBSCR_J1_class.jpg.webp","url":"Tank_locomotive"}
