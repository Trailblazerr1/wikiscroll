{"title":"Glorious Revolution","summary":"The Glorious Revolution of November 1688 (Irish: An Réabhlóid Ghlórmhar; Scottish Gaelic: Rèabhlaid Ghlòrmhor; Welsh: Chwyldro Gogoneddus), the invasion also known as the Glorieuze Overtocht or Glorious Crossing by the Dutch, was the deposition of James II and VII, king of England, Scotland and Ireland and replacement by his daughter Mary II and her husband, William III of Orange, stadtholder and de facto ruler of the Dutch Republic. A term first used by John Hampden in late 1689,[1] historian Jeremy Black suggests it can be seen as both the last successful invasion of England and also an internal coup.[2][3]","image":"Prince_of_Orange_engraving_by_William_Miller_after_Turner_R739.jpg.webp","url":"Glorious_Revolution"}
