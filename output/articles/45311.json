{"title":"Tiv people","summary":"Tiv (or Tiiv)[2] are a Tivoid ethnic group. They constitute approximately 5% of Nigeria's total population, and number over 14 million individuals throughout Nigeria and Cameroon. The Tiv language is spoken by about 15 million people in Nigeria with a few speakers in Cameroon. Most of the language's Nigerian speakers are found in Benue, Taraba, Nasarawa and Plateau States. The language is a branch of Benue–Congo and ultimately of the Niger–Congo phylum. In pre-colonial times, the Fulani ethnic group referred to the Tiv as \"Munchi\" (also sometimes written Munshi e.g. Duggan 1932 and Ako 1981), a term not accepted by Tiv people. They depend on agricultural produce for commerce and life.","image":"Tiv_elders.jpg.webp","url":"Tiv_people"}
