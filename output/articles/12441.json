{"title":"Deep frying","summary":"Deep frying (also referred to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, traditionally lard but today most commonly oil, as opposed to the shallow oil used in conventional frying done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as a hot-fat cooking method.[1][2] Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of the food are cooked simultaneously as oil has a high rate of heat conduction.[3]","image":"Frituren.jpg.webp"}
