{"title":"Parking brake","summary":"In road vehicles, the parking brake, also known as a handbrake or emergency brake (e-brake),[1] is a mechanism used to keep the vehicle securely motionless when parked. Parking brakes often consist of a cable connected to two wheel brakes, which is then connected to a pulling mechanism. In most vehicles, the parking brake operates only on the rear wheels,[2] which have reduced traction while braking. The mechanism may be a hand-operated lever, a straight pull handle located near the steering column or a foot-operated pedal located with the other pedals.","image":"Handbrake_lever.JPG.webp"}
