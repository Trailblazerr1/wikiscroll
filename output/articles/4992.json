{"title":"Australians","summary":"Australians, colloquially referred to as \"Aussies\", are the citizens, nationals and individuals associated with the country of Australia. This connection may be residential, legal, historical or cultural. For most Australians, several (or all) of these connections exist and are collectively the source of their being Australian. Australian law does not provide for a racial or ethnic component of nationality, instead relying on citizenship as a legal status.","image":"Flag_of_Australia_(converted).svg.png.webp"}
