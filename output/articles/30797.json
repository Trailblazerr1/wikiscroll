Most modern multi-sports events have the same basic structure. Games are held over the course of several days in and around a \"host city\", which changes for each competition.

Each games are generally held every four years, though some are annual competitions.","image":"Olympic_Park%2C_London%2C_16_April_2012.jpg.webp","url":"Multi-sport_event"}
