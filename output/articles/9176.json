{"title":"Chagas disease","summary":"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi.[1] It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae, or \"kissing bugs\".[1] The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or swelling at the site of the bite.[1] After four to eight weeks, untreated individuals enter the chronic phase of disease, which in most cases does not result in further symptoms.[2][5] Up to 45% of people with chronic infection develop heart disease 10â€“30 years after the initial illness, which can lead to heart failure.[2] Digestive complications, including an enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon, may also occur in up to 21% of people, and up to 10% of people may experience nerve damage.[2]","image":"Trypanosoma_cruzi_in_a_blood_smear.jpg.webp"}
