{"title":"Pan-American Highway","summary":"The Pan-American Highway (French: (Auto)route panaméricaine/transaméricaine; Portuguese: Rodovia/Auto-estrada Pan-americana; Spanish: Autopista/Carretera/Ruta Panamericana) is a network of roads stretching across the Americas and measuring about 30,000 kilometres (19,000 mi)[1] in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately 106 km (66 mi) across the border between southeast Panama and northwest Colombia, called the Darién Gap, the roads link almost all of the Pacific coastal countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to Guinness World Records, the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest \"motorable road\". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is only possible to cross by land between South America and Central America—the last town in Colombia to the first outpost in Panama—by a difficult hike of at least four days through a very dangerous and humid region.","image":"PanAmericanHwy.png.webp","url":"Pan-American_Highway"}
