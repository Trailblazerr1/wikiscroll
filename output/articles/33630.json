{"title":"Paddlefish","summary":"Paddlefish (family Polyodontidae) are basal Chondrostean ray-finned fish.[2]  They have been referred to as \"primitive fish\" because they have evolved with few morphological changes since the earliest fossil records of the Early Cretaceous,  120 to 125 million years ago.[3]  Polyodontids are almost exclusively North American and Chinese, both extant and in the fossil record.[4]","image":"Paddlefish_Polyodon_spathula.jpg.webp"}
