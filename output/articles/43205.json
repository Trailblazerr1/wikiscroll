{"title":"T206 Honus Wagner","summary":"The T206 Honus Wagner baseball card depicts the Pittsburgh Pirates' Honus Wagner, known as \"The Flying Dutchman,‚Äù a dead-ball era baseball player who is widely considered to be one of the best players of all time.[1] The card was designed and issued by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its T206 series. Wagner refused to allow production of his baseball card to continue, either because he did not want children to buy cigarette packs to get his card, or because he wanted more compensation from the ATC. The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 50 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public (exact number unknown), as compared to the \"tens or hundreds of thousands\" of T206 cards, over three years in sixteen brands of cigarettes, for any other player.[2] In 1933, the card was first listed at a price value of US$50 in Jefferson Burdick's The American Card Catalog (equivalent to $1,000 in 2020), making it the most expensive baseball card in the world at the time.","image":"Honus_wagner_t206_baseball_card.jpg.webp"}
