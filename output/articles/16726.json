{"title":"Fortuna","summary":"Fortuna (Latin: Fortūna, equivalent to the Greek goddess Tyche) is the goddess of fortune and the personification of luck in Roman religion who, largely thanks to the Late Antique author Boethius, remained popular through the Middle Ages until at least the Renaissance. The blindfolded depiction of her is still an important figure in many aspects of today's Italian culture, where the dichotomy fortuna / sfortuna (luck / unluck) plays a prominent role in everyday social life, also represented by the very common refrain \"La [dea] fortuna è cieca\" (latin Fortuna caeca est; \"Luck [goddess] is blind\").","image":"CarminaBurana_wheel.jpg.webp","url":"Fortuna"}
