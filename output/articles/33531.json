{"title":"Oxide","summary":"An oxide (/ˈɒksaɪd/) is a chemical compound that contains at least one oxygen atom and one other element[1] in its chemical formula. \"Oxide\" itself is the dianion of oxygen, an O2– (molecular) ion. Metal oxides thus typically contain an anion of oxygen in the oxidation state of −2. Most of the Earth's crust consists of solid oxides, the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water.  Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating.  For example, aluminium foil develops a thin skin of Al2O3 (called a passivation layer) that protects the foil from further corrosion.[2]   Certain elements can form multiple oxides, differing in the amounts of the element combining with the oxygen.  Examples are carbon, iron, nitrogen (see nitrogen oxide), silicon, titanium, lithium, and aluminium. In such cases the oxides are distinguished by specifying the numbers of atoms involved, as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, or by specifying the element's oxidation number, as in iron(II) oxide and iron(III) oxide.","image":"Rutile-unit-cell-3D-balls.png.webp","url":"Oxide"}
