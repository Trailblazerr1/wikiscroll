{"title":"List of premiers of British Columbia","summary":"The premier of British Columbia is the first minister for the Canadian province of British Columbia. The province was a British crown colony governed by the Governors of British Columbia[1] before joining Canadian Confederation in 1871.[2] Since then, it has had a unicameral Westminster-style parliamentary government, in which the premier is the leader of the party that controls the most seats in the legislative assembly. The premier is British Columbia's head of government, and the Queen of Canada is its head of state and is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia. The premier picks a cabinet from the elected members to form the Executive Council of British Columbia and presides over that body.[3]","image":"John_Horgan_2015.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_premiers_of_British_Columbia"}
