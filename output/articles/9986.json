{"title":"Church (building)","summary":"A church building, church house, or simply church, is a building used for Christian worship services and other Christian religious activities. The term is usually used to refer to the physical buildings where Christians worship and also to refer to the community of Christians. Sometimes it is used as an analogy for the buildings of other religions.[1] In traditional Christian architecture, the plan view of a church often forms a Christian cross; the center aisle and seating representing the vertical beam with the bema and altar forming the horizontal. Towers or domes may inspire contemplation of the heavens. Modern churches have a variety of architectural styles and layouts. Some buildings designed for other purposes have been converted to churches, while many original church buildings have been put to other uses. The word church in Christian doctrine is used to describe the Christian religious community as a whole, or a body or an assembly of Christian believers around the world.[2]","image":"Christian_cross.svg.png.webp","url":"Church_(building)"}
