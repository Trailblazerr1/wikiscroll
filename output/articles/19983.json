{"title":"Helladic chronology","summary":"Helladic chronology is a relative dating system used in archaeology and art history. It complements the Minoan chronology scheme devised by Sir Arthur Evans for the categorisation of Bronze Age artefacts from the Minoan civilization within a historical framework. Whereas Minoan chronology is specific to Crete, the cultural and geographical scope of Helladic chronology is mainland Greece during the same timespan (c.3200â€“c.1050). Similarly, a Cycladic chronology system is used for artifacts found in the Aegean islands. Archaeological evidence has shown that, broadly, civilisation developed concurrently across the whole region and so the three schemes complement each other chronologically.  They are grouped together as \"Aegean\" in terms such as Aegean art and, rather more controversially, Aegean civilization.","image":"Grave-Circle-A-Mycenae.jpg.webp","url":"Helladic_chronology"}
