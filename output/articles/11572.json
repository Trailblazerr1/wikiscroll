{"title":"Crown jewels","summary":"Crown jewels are the objects of metalwork and jewellery in the regalia of a current or former monarchy.  They are often used for the coronation of a monarch and a few other ceremonial occasions. A monarch may often be shown wearing them in portraits, as they symbolize the power and continuity of the monarchy.  Additions to them may be made, but since medieval times the existing items are typically passed down unchanged as they symbolize the continuity of the monarchy.","image":"Crown_Jewels_of_Austria.jpg.webp","url":"Crown_jewels"}
