{"title":"Common Agricultural Policy","summary":"The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has undergone several changes since then to reduce the cost (from 73% of the EEC budget in 1985 to 37% of the EU budget in 2017[1]) and to also consider rural development in its aims. It has been criticised on the grounds of its cost, and its environmental and humanitarian impacts.[2][3]","image":"Flag_of_Europe.svg.png.webp","url":"Common_Agricultural_Policy"}
