{"title":"Cherenkov radiation","summary":"Cherenkov radiation (/tʃəˈrɛŋkɒf/;[1] Russian: Черенко́в) is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity (speed of propagation of a wavefront in a medium) of light in that medium.[2]  A classic example of Cherenkov radiation is the characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor. Its cause is similar to the cause of a sonic boom, the sharp sound heard when faster-than-sound movement occurs. The phenomenon is named after Soviet physicist Pavel Cherenkov, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics for its discovery.","image":"Advanced_Test_Reactor.jpg.webp","url":"Cherenkov_radiation"}
