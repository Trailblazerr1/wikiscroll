{"title":"2020 United States census","summary":"The United States census of 2020 was the twenty-fourth decennial United States Census. Census Day, the reference day used for the census, was April 1, 2020. Other than a pilot study during the 2000 census,[1] this was the first US census to offer options to respond online or by phone, in addition to the paper response form used for previous censuses.[2] The census was taken during the COVID-19 pandemic which affected its administration. The census recorded a resident population of 331,449,281, an increase of 7.4 percent, or 22,703,743, over the preceding decade.[3] The growth rate was the second-lowest ever recorded, and the net increase was the sixth highest in history. This was the first census where the ten most populous states each surpassed 10 million residents.","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Census_Bureau.svg.png.webp"}
