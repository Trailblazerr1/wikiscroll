Or Siyam, Arabic: صِيَام‎; Arabic pronunciation: [sˤijaːm], also commonly known as Rūzeh or Rōzah, Persian: روزه‎ in non-Arab Muslim countries) is the practice of abstaining, usually from food, drink, smoking, and sexual activity. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Sawm is observed between dawn and nightfall when the adhan of the Maghrib prayer is sounded.[2] Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar and fasting is a requirement for Muslims as it is the fourth of the five pillars of Islam.[3]","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp"}
