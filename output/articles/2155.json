{"title":"Adaptive optics","summary":"Adaptive optics (AO) is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of incoming wavefront distortions by deforming a mirror in order to compensate for the distortion. It is used in astronomical telescopes[1] and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, in microscopy,[2] optical fabrication[3] and in retinal imaging systems[4] to reduce optical aberrations. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a wavefront and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array.","image":"Deformable_mirror_correction.svg.png.webp"}
