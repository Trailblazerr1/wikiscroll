{"title":"National Council of Provinces","summary":"The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) is the upper house of the Parliament of South Africa under the (post-apartheid) constitution which came into full effect in 1997. It replaced the former Senate, but is very similar to that body, and to many other upper houses of legislatures throughout the world, in that its purpose is to represent the governments of the provinces, rather than directly representing the people.[1]","image":"South_African_National_Council_of_Provinces_2019.svg.png.webp","url":"National_Council_of_Provinces"}
