{"title":"Pipa","summary":"The pipa, pípá, or p'i-p'a (Chinese: 琵琶) is a  traditional Chinese musical instrument, belonging to the plucked category of instruments.  Sometimes called the \"Chinese lute“, the instrument has a pear-shaped wooden body with a varying number of frets ranging from 12 to 31.  Another Chinese four-string plucked lute is the liuqin, which looks like a smaller version of the pipa. The pear-shaped instrument may have existed in China as early as the Han dynasty, and although historically the term pipa was once used to refer to a variety of plucked chordophones, its usage since the Song dynasty refers exclusively to the pear-shaped instrument.","image":"Pipa_MET_DP216710.jpg.webp","url":"Pipa"}
