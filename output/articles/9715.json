{"title":"Chinoiserie","summary":"Chinoiserie (English: /ʃɪnˈwɑːzəri/, French: [ʃinwazʁi]; loanword from French chinoiserie, from chinois, \"Chinese\"; simplified Chinese: 中国风; traditional Chinese: 中國風; pinyin: Zhōngguófēng; lit. 'China style') is the European interpretation and imitation of Chinese and other East Asian artistic traditions, especially in the decorative arts, garden design, architecture, literature, theatre, and music.[1] The aesthetic of Chinoiserie has been expressed in different ways depending on the region. Its acknowledgement derives from the current of Orientalism, which studied Far East cultures from a historical, philological, anthropological, philosophical and religious point of view. First appearing in the 17th century, this trend was popularized in the 18th century due to the rise in trade with China and the rest of East Asia.[2]","image":"Museo_delle_porcellane_di_Firenze%2C_porcellane_viennesi_a_cineserie%2C_1799%2C_02.JPG.webp","url":"Chinoiserie"}
