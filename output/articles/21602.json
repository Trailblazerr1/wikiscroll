{"title":"Ignatius of Loyola","summary":"Ignatius of Loyola (c. 23 October 1491–31 July 1556; b. Iñigo López de Oñaz y Loyola; Basque: Ignazio Loiolakoa; Spanish: Ignacio de Loyola; Latin: Ignatius de Loyola)[2] — venerated as Saint Ignatius of Loyola — was a Spanish Catholic priest and theologian, who, with Peter Faber and Francis Xavier, founded the religious order of the Society of Jesus (The Jesuits), and became the first Superior General of the Society of Jesus, at Paris, in 1541.[3] Teaching and missionary work are the purposes of the Society of Jesus, who, as priests, are bound by a fourth (special) vow of obedience to the sovereign pontiff, to be ever-ready to fulfill the special missions of the papacy;[4] thus the Jesuits were instrumental in realizing the Counter-Reformation.[5]","image":"Ignatius_Loyola.jpg.webp"}
