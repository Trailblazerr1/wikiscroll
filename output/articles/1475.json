{"title":"Rome","summary":"Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] (listen)) is the capital city of Italy.  It is also the capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi),[1] Rome is the country's most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy.[2] Its metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy.[3] Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country in the world)[4] is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason,  Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states.[5][6] Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location and also the \"Eternal City.\"[7]","image":"Rome_Montage_2017.png.webp","url":"A%2fRome"}
