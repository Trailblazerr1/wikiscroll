{"title":"Beleriand","summary":"In J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional legendarium, Beleriand was a region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Events in Beleriand are described chiefly in his work The Silmarillion, which tells the story of the early ages of Middle-earth in a style similar to the epic hero tales of Nordic literature.[1] Beleriand also appears in the works The Book of Lost Tales,[2] The Children of HÃºrin,[3] and in the epic poems of The Lays of Beleriand.","image":"MapaDeBeleriand.jpg.webp","url":"Beleriand"}
