{"title":"What'd I Say","summary":"\"What'd I Say\" (or \"What I Say\") is an American rhythm and blues song by Ray Charles, released in 1959. As a  single divided into two parts, it was one of the first soul songs.  The composition was improvised one evening late in 1958 when Charles, his orchestra, and backup singers had played their entire set list at a show and still had time left; the response from many audiences was so enthusiastic that Charles announced to his producer that he was going to record it.","image":"Whatdisaycharles.jpg.webp","url":"What'd_I_Say"}
