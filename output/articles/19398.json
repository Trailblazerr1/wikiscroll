{"title":"Hair (musical)","summary":"Hair:  The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical is a rock musical with a book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado and music by Galt MacDermot. The work reflects the creators' observations of the hippie counterculture and sexual revolution of the late 1960s, and several of its songs became anthems of the anti-Vietnam War peace movement. The musical's profanity, its depiction of the use of illegal drugs, its treatment of sexuality, its irreverence for the American flag, and its nude scene caused much comment and controversy.[1] The work broke new ground in musical theatre by defining the genre of \"rock musical\", using a racially integrated cast, and inviting the audience onstage for a \"Be-In\" finale.[2]","image":"Hairposter.jpg.webp","url":"Hair_(musical)"}
