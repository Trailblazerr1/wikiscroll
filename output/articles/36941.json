{"title":"Radio Caroline","summary":"Radio Caroline is a British radio station founded in 1964 by Ronan O'Rahilly and George Drummond [1] initially to circumvent the record companies' control of popular music broadcasting in the United Kingdom and the BBC's radio broadcasting monopoly.[2] Unlicensed by any government for most of its early life, it was a pirate radio station that never became illegal as such due to operating outside any national jurisdiction, although after the Marine Offences Act (1967) it became illegal for a British subject to associate with it.","image":"Mi_Amigo_kleine.jpg.webp","url":"Radio_Caroline"}
