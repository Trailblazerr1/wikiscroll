{"title":"Regional planning","summary":"Regional planning  deals with the efficient placement of land-use activities, infrastructure, and settlement growth across a larger area of land than an individual city or town.  Regional planning is related to urban planning as it relates land use practices on a broader scale. It also includes formulating laws that will guide the efficient planning and management of such said regions.[1] Regional planning can be comprehensive by covering various subjects, but it more often specifies a particular subject, which requires region-wide consideration.[2]","image":"Sustainable_development.svg.png.webp","url":"Regional_planning"}
