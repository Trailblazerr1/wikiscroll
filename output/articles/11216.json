{"title":"Corneliu Zelea Codreanu","summary":"Corneliu Zelea Codreanu[lower-alpha 1] (Romanian: [korˈneliu ˈzele̯a koˈdre̯anu] (listen); 13 September 1899 – 30 November 1938)—born Corneliu Zelinski and commonly known as Corneliu Codreanu—was a Romanian politician of the far right, the founder and charismatic leader of the Iron Guard or The Legion of the Archangel Michael (also known as the Legionary Movement), an ultranationalist and violently antisemitic organization active throughout most of the interwar period. Generally seen as the main variety of local fascism, and noted for its mystical and Romanian Orthodox-inspired revolutionary message, it gained prominence on the Romanian political stage, coming into conflict with the political establishment and the democratic forces, and often resorting to terrorism. The Legionnaires traditionally referred to Codreanu as Căpitanul (\"The Captain\"), and he held absolute authority over the organization until his death.","image":"Corneliu_Zelea_Codreanu.jpg.webp","url":"Corneliu_Zelea_Codreanu"}
