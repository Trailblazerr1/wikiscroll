{"title":"Flag of Azerbaijan","summary":"The national flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijani: Azərbaycan bayrağı) is a horizontal tricolour featuring three equally sized fesses of bright blue, red, and green, with a white crescent and an eight-pointed star in the center. The tricolour replaced an earlier design used by the Azerbaijan SSR. The bright blue symbolizes Azerbaijan's Turkic heritage, the red stands for progress, and the green represents Islam, the religion of the majority of Azerbaijanis. The official colors and size were adopted on 5 February 1991.[1] This flag was used from 9 November 1918 to 1920, when Azerbaijan was independent, and it was revived with slight variations on 5 February 1991.[2] The nickname for the flag is The Tricolour Flag (Azerbaijani: Üçrəngli bayraq).","image":"Flag_of_Azerbaijan.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Azerbaijan"}
