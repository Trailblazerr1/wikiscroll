{"title":"Abydos, Egypt","summary":"Abydos /əˈbaɪdɒs/ (Arabic: أبيدوس‎, romanized: Abīdūs; Sahidic Coptic: Ⲉⲃⲱⲧ Ebōt) is one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt, and also of the eighth nome in Upper Egypt. It is located about 11 kilometres (6.8 miles) west of the Nile at latitude 26° 10' N, near the modern Egyptian towns of El Araba El Madfuna and El Balyana.  In the ancient Egyptian language, the city was called Abdju (ꜣbḏw or AbDw).  The English name Abydos comes from the Greek Ἄβυδος, a name borrowed by Greek geographers from the unrelated city of Abydos on the Hellespont.","image":"AbydosFacade.jpg.webp","url":"Abydos,_Egypt"}
