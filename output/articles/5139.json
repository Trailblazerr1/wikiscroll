{"title":"Ayahuasca","summary":"Ayahuasca[note 1] is a South American (pan-Amazonian)[1] psychoactive brew used both socially and as ceremonial spiritual medicine among the indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin.[2][3] It is a psychedelic and entheogenic brew commonly made out of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine, the Psychotria viridis shrub or a substitute, and possibly other ingredients. [4] A chemically similar preparation, sometimes called \"pharmahuasca\", can be prepared using N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a pharmaceutical monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), such as isocarboxazid.[5][6] B. caapi contains several alkaloids that act as MAOIs, which are required for DMT to be orally active.[7] Ayahuasca is prepared in a tea that, when consumed, causes an altered state of consciousness or \"high\", including visual hallucinations and altered perceptions of reality.[8]","image":"Aya-cooking.jpg.webp","url":"Ayahuasca"}
