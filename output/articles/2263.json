{"title":"Advanced Configuration and Power Interface","summary":"In a computer, the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) provides an open standard that operating systems can use to discover and configure computer hardware components, to perform power management e.g. putting unused hardware components to sleep, to perform auto configuration e.g. Plug and Play and hot swapping, and to perform status monitoring. First released in December 1996, ACPI aims to replace Advanced Power Management (APM), the MultiProcessor Specification, the PCI BIOS specification,[1][2] and the Plug and Play BIOS (PnP) Specification.[3] ACPI brings power management under the control of the operating system, as opposed to the previous BIOS-centric system that relied on platform-specific firmware to determine power management and configuration policies.[4] The specification is central to the Operating System-directed configuration and Power Management (OSPM) system. ACPI defines a hardware abstraction interface between the devices firmware (e.g. BIOS, UEFI), the computer hardware components, and the operating systems.[5][6]","image":"Example_of_ACPI_tables_screenshot.png.webp"}
