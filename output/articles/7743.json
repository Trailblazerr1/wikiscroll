{"title":"Bruce Grobbelaar","summary":"Bruce David Grobbelaar (born 6 October 1957) is a Zimbabwean former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper, most prominently for English team Liverpool between 1981 and 1994, and for the Zimbabwean national team. He is remembered for his gymnastic-like athletic ability, unflappable confidence and eccentric and flamboyant style of play, as well as his rushing ability, which has led pundits to compare him retrospectively to the sweeper-keepers of the modern era.[1][2] He was  appointed as goalkeeper coach for Ottawa Fury FC of the North American Soccer League in 2014.[3] In March 2018 he was announced as goalkeeper coach for the Matabeleland football team.[4]","image":"Bruce_Grobbelaar.png.webp"}
