{"title":"Pin Ups","summary":"Pin Ups (also referred to as Pinups and Pin-Ups)[lower-alpha 1] is the seventh studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 19 October 1973 by RCA Records. Devised as a \"stop-gap\" album to appease his record label, it is a covers album, featuring songs by British bands from the 1960s that were influential to Bowie as a teenager, including the Pretty Things, the Who, the Yardbirds and Pink Floyd. The tracks mostly stay true to their original counterparts, albeit performed in glam rock and proto-punk styles.","image":"PinUps.jpg.webp"}
