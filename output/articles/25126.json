{"title":"Kuomintang","summary":"The Kuomintang (KMT), also referred to as the Guomindang (GMD)[29][upper-roman 1] or the Chinese Nationalist Party,[30] is a political party in the Republic of China, initially on the Chinese mainland and in Taiwan after 1949. Originally the sole ruling party under the Dang Guo system, the KMT is currently the largest opposition party in the Legislative Yuan. In Taiwanese politics, the KMT primarily competes with the rival Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The KMT opposes de jure Taiwan independence and Chinese unification under \"One Country, Two Systems\", instead favoring cross-strait relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC) and maintaining Taiwan's status quo under the Constitution of the Republic of China. The current chairman is Eric Chu. The KMT is one of two major historical contemporary parties in China, the other being the Chinese Communist Party.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Kuomintang.svg.png.webp"}
