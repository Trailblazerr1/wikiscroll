{"title":"Right to life","summary":"The right to life is the belief that a being has the right to live and, in particular, should not be killed by another entity, including a government. The concept of a right to life arises in debates on issues of capital punishment, with some people seeing it as immoral, in war, which is seen by some as a wrong and tragic act, in abortion, where some feel an unborn life should not be ended prematurely, in euthanasia, where the ending of an elderly person’s life outside of natural means is seen as incorrect, with police brutality, which is seen as an infringement of a person’s right to live, in justifiable homicide, with some believing that no instance of homicide is truly justifiable, and with animal rights, whose lives are seen just as worthy of protection as that of humans. Various individuals may disagree on which of these areas this principle might apply.","image":"Protestors_with_sign_Venezuela_2014.jpg.webp","url":"Right_to_life"}
