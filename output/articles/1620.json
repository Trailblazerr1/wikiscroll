{"title":"Vatican City","summary":"Vatican City (/ˈvætɪkən/ (listen)), officially the Vatican City State (Italian: Stato della Città del Vaticano;[lower-alpha 5] Latin: Status Civitatis Vaticanae),[lower-alpha 6][lower-alpha 7] is an independent city state and enclave located within Rome, Italy.[11][12] The Vatican City State, also known simply as the Vatican, became independent from Italy with the Lateran Treaty (1929), and it is a distinct territory under \"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity of international law, which maintains the city state's temporal, diplomatic, and spiritual independence.[lower-alpha 8][13] With an area of 49 hectares (121 acres)[lower-alpha 2] and a population of about 825,[8] it is the smallest state in the world by both area and population.[14] As governed by the Holy See, the Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state (a type of theocracy) ruled by the pope who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.[3][15] The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various national origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1437),[16] the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.","image":"View_from_Vatican_city.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fVatican_City"}
