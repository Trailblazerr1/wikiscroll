{"title":"Ethical egoism","summary":"Ethical egoism  is the normative ethical position that moral agents ought to act in their own self-interest. It differs from psychological egoism, which claims that people can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from rational egoism, which holds that it is rational to act in one's self-interest.[1]\nEthical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer are ethical.[2]","image":"Symbol_portal_class.svg.png.webp"}
