{"title":"Corporate social responsibility","summary":"Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a form of international private business self-regulation[1] which aims to contribute to societal goals of a philanthropic, activist, or charitable nature by engaging in or supporting volunteering or ethically-oriented practices.[2] While once it was possible to describe CSR as an internal organisational policy or a corporate ethic strategy,[3] that time has passed as various national and international laws have been developed and various organisations have used their authority to push it beyond individual or even industry-wide initiatives. While it has been considered a form of corporate self-regulation[4] for some time, over the last decade or so it has moved considerably from voluntary decisions at the level of individual organizations to mandatory schemes at regional, national, and international levels.","image":"Habitat_For_Humanity_Build_2011_037.jpg.webp"}
