{"title":"Eat a Peach","summary":"Eat a Peach is a 1972 double album by American rock band the Allman Brothers Band, containing a mix of live and studio recordings. Following their artistic and commercial breakthrough with the release of the live album At Fillmore East (1971), the Allman Brothers Band got to work on their third studio album. Many in the band were struggling, however, with heroin addictions, and checked into rehab to confront these problems. On October 29, 1971, group leader and founder Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident in the band's hometown of Macon, Georgia, making it the final album to feature the guitarist. Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released on February 12, 1972, in the United States by Capricorn Records. It was the band's fourth album since their debut The Allman Brothers Band in 1969, and is their third studio album and second live album.","image":"Eat_a_Peach_(James_Flournoy_Holmes_album_-_cover_art).jpg.webp","url":"Eat_a_Peach"}
