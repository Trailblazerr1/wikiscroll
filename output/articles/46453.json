{"title":"US Airways Flight 1549","summary":"On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549, an Airbus A320 on a flight from New York City's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina, struck a flock of birds shortly after take-off, losing all engine power. Unable to reach any airport for an emergency landing due to their low altitude, pilots Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles glided the plane to a ditching in the Hudson River off Midtown Manhattan.[1] All 155 people on board were rescued by nearby boats, with only a few serious injuries.","image":"US_Airways_Flight_1549_(N106US)_after_crashing_into_the_Hudson_River_(crop_2).jpg.webp","url":"US_Airways_Flight_1549"}
