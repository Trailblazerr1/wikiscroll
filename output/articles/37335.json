{"title":"Reconstructionist Judaism","summary":"Reconstructionist Judaism[lower-alpha 1]  is a modern Jewish movement  that views Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization and is based on the conceptions developed by Mordecai Kaplan (1881â€“1983).[1][2] The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within Conservative Judaism and developed from the late 1920s to 1940s, before it seceded in 1955[3] and established a rabbinical college in 1967.[4] (The central organization of the movement renamed itself to Reconstructing Judaism in 2018, but the ideology's name remains unchanged.[5]) Reconstructionist Judaism is recognized by some scholars as the fourth major stream of Judaism, after Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.[6][7]","image":"Reconstructing_Judaism_sign.jpg.webp","url":"Reconstructionist_Judaism"}
