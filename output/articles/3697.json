{"title":"Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran","summary":"The Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran or Anglo-Soviet invasion of Persia was the joint invasion of the neutral Imperial State of Iran by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union in August 1941. The invasion, codenamed Operation Countenance, was largely unopposed by the numerically and technologically outmatched Iranian forces. The multi-pronged coordinated invasion took place along Iran's borders with modern Iraq, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, with fighting beginning on 25 August and ending on 31 August when the Iranian government formally agreed to surrender, having already agreed to a ceasefire on 30 August.[1]","image":"Soviet_tankmen_of_the_6th_Armoured_Division_drive_through_the_streets_of_Tabriz_(2).jpg.webp","url":"Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran"}
