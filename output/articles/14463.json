{"title":"Electromotive force","summary":"In electromagnetism and electronics, electromotive force (emf, denoted E {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}} and measured in volts)[1] is the electrical action produced by a non-electrical source.[2] Devices (known as transducers) provide an emf[3] by converting other forms of energy into electrical energy,[3] such as batteries (which convert chemical energy) or generators (which convert mechanical energy).[2]  Sometimes an analogy to water pressure is used to describe electromotive force.[4]  (The word \"force\" in this case is not used to mean forces of interaction between bodies).","image":"9c298ed828ff778065aeb5f0f305097f55bb9ae0.svg","url":"Electromotive_force"}
