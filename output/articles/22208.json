{"title":"International Style (architecture)","summary":"The International Style or internationalism[1] is a major architectural style that was developed in the 1920s and 1930s and was closely related to modernism and modern architecture. It was first defined by Museum of Modern Art curators Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson in 1932, based on works of architecture from the 1920s. The terms rationalist architecture and modern movement  are often used interchangeably with International Style,[1][2][3][4] although the former is mostly used in the English-speaking world to specifically refer to the Italian rationalism of architects such as Giuseppe Terragni and Gino Pollini,[5] or even the International Style that developed in Europe as a whole.[6]","image":"Lovell_House%2C_Los_Angeles%2C_California.JPG.webp","url":"International_Style_(architecture)"}
