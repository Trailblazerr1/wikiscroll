{"title":"Glass transition","summary":"The glassâ€“liquid transition, or glass transition, is the gradual and reversible transition in amorphous materials (or in amorphous regions within semicrystalline materials) from a hard and relatively brittle \"glassy\" state into a viscous or rubbery state as the temperature is increased.[1][2] An amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition is called a glass. The reverse transition, achieved by supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state, is called vitrification.","image":"Tgdilatometric.gif","url":"A%2fGlass_transition"}
