{"title":"50 Greatest Players in NBA History","summary":"The 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, also referred to as NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team or NBA's Top 50, were chosen in 1996 to honor the 50th anniversary of the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA). It was the third anniversary team in the league.[1] Fifty players were selected through a vote by a panel of media members, former players and coaches, and current and former general managers. In addition, the top ten head coaches and top ten single-season teams in NBA history were selected by media members as part of the celebration.[2] The 50 players had to have played at least a portion of their careers in the NBA and were selected irrespective of position played.","image":"Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar_Lipofsky.jpg.webp","url":"50_Greatest_Players_in_NBA_History"}
