{"title":"Printed circuit board","summary":"A printed circuit board (PCB) is a laminated sandwich structure of conductive and insulating layers. PCBs have two complementary functions.  The first is to affix electronic components in designated locations on the outer layers by means of soldering.  The second is to provide reliable electrical connections (and also reliable open circuits) between the component's terminals in a controlled manner often referred to as PCB design.Â  Each of the conductive layers is designed with an artwork pattern of conductors (similar to wires on a flat surface) that provides electrical connections on that conductive layer. Another manufacturing process adds vias , plated-through holes that allow interconnections between layers.","image":"SEG_DVD_430_-_Printed_circuit_board-4276.jpg.webp","url":"Printed_circuit_board"}
