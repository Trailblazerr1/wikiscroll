{"title":"Hecate","summary":"Hecate or Hekate[lower-alpha 1] is a goddess in ancient Greek religion and mythology, most often shown holding a pair of torches, a key, snakes or accompanied by dogs[1] and in later periods depicted in triple form. She is variously associated with crossroads, entrance-ways, night, light, magic, witchcraft, knowledge of herbs and poisonous plants, ghosts, necromancy, and sorcery.[2][3] Her earliest appearance in literature was in Hesiod's Theogony in the 8th century BCE[4] as a goddess of great honour with domains in sky, earth, and sea. Her place of origin is debated by scholars, but she had popular followings amongst the witches of Thessaly[5] and an important sanctuary among the Carian Greeks of Asia Minor in Lagina.[5]","image":"Hecate_Chiaramonti_Inv1922.jpg.webp"}
