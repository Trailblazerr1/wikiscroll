{"title":"Dodge Caravan","summary":"The Dodge Caravan (and the long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan) is a series of minivans that was manufactured by Chrysler from the 1984 to 2020 model years.  The Dodge version of the Chrysler minivans, the Caravan was marketed as both a passenger van and a cargo van (the only version of the model line offered in the latter configuration).  For 1987, a long-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan was introduced (becoming the sole version of the model line from 2008 onward).  Produced for five generations across 36 model years, Dodge Caravan is the second longest-lived Dodge nameplate (exceeded only by the Dodge Charger).","image":"2011_Dodge_Grand_Caravan_Mainstreet_--_02-17-2011.jpg.webp","url":"Dodge_Caravan"}
