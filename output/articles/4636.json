{"title":"Ask and Embla","summary":"In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (Old Norse: Askr ok Embla [ˈɑskz̠ ok ˈemblɑ])—male and female respectively—were the first two humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, one of whom is Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various corporeal and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.","image":"Odin%2C_Lodur%2C_Hoenir_skabe_Ask_og_Embla_by_Frølich.jpg.webp","url":"Ask_and_Embla"}
