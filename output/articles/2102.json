{"title":"Active transport","summary":"{{about ===== |transport in the woodswoods biology|human transport systems|active transportation}} {{Sho == rt description|Cellular molecule transport mechanism against the concentration gradient}} In cellular biology, active transport is the movement of molecules across a cell membrane from a region of lower concentration to a region of  higher concentrationâ€”against the concentration gradient. Active transport requires cellular energy to achieve this movement. There are two types of active transport: primary active transport that uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and secondary active transport that uses an electrochemical gradient.","image":"Scheme_sodium-potassium_pump-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Active_transport"}
