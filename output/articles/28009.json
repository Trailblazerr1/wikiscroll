{"title":"Magnetic susceptibility","summary":"In electromagnetism, the magnetic susceptibility (Latin: susceptibilis, \"receptive\"; denoted χ) is a measure of how much a material will become magnetized in an applied magnetic field. It is the ratio of magnetization M (magnetic moment per unit volume) to the applied magnetizing field intensity H. This allows a simple classification, into two categories, of most materials' responses to an applied magnetic field: an alignment with the magnetic field, χ > 0, called paramagnetism, or an alignment against the field, χ < 0, called diamagnetism.","image":"11af85c51ba9df8132884350bd42ea23ce8e1ce0.svg","url":"Magnetic_susceptibility"}
