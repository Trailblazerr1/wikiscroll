{"title":"Order of Merit","summary":"The Order of Merit (French: Ordre du Mérite)[n 1] is a Commonwealth order of merit recognising distinguished service in the armed forces, science, art, literature, or for the promotion of culture. Established in 1902 by King Edward VII, admission into the order remains the personal gift of its Sovereign—currently Edward VII's great-granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II—and is restricted to a maximum of 24 living recipients from the Commonwealth realms, plus a limited number of honorary members.[1][2] While all members are awarded the right to use the post-nominal letters OM and wear the badge of the order,[3] the Order of Merit's precedence among other honours differs between countries.","image":"Order_of_Merit_Dorothy_Hodgkin_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Order_of_Merit"}
