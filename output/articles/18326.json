{"title":"God Hates Us All","summary":"God Hates Us All is the ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer, released on September 11, 2001 by American Recordings. It was recorded over three months at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, and includes the Grammy Award-nominated song \"Disciple\". Guitarist Kerry King wrote the majority of its lyrics, taking a different approach from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge, and self-control. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C♯ tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in B♭. It is the final album to feature drummer Paul Bostaph until 2015's Repentless, as he departed the band three months after the album's release.","image":"Slayer-GodHatesUsAll.jpg.webp"}
