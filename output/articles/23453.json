{"title":"Jingle Bells","summary":"\"Jingle Bells\" is one of the best-known[1] and commonly sung[2] American songs in the world. It was written by James Lord Pierpont (1822â€“1893) and published under the title \"The One Horse Open Sleigh\" in the autumn of 1857. It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday school choir, or as a drinking song.[3] Although it has no original connection to Christmas,[4] it became associated with Christmas music and the holiday season in the 1860s and 1870s, and it was featured in a variety of parlor song and college anthologies in the 1880s.[5] It was first recorded in 1889 on an Edison cylinder; this recording, believed to be the first Christmas record, is lost, but an 1898 recording also from Edison Records survives.[6]","image":"One_Horse_Open_Sleigh_title_page.jpg.webp","url":"Jingle_Bells"}
