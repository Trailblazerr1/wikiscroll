{"title":"Plant nutrition","summary":"Plant nutrition is the study of the chemical elements and compounds necessary for plant growth, plant metabolism and their external supply. In its absence the plant is unable to complete a normal life cycle, or that the element is part of some essential plant constituent or metabolite. This is in accordance with Justus von Liebigâ€™s law of the minimum.[1] The total essential plant nutrients include seventeen different elements: carbon, oxygen and hydrogen which are absorbed from the air, whereas other nutrients including nitrogen are typically obtained from the  soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants).","image":"Manure_spreading_Hlokozi_2007_11_29.jpg.webp","url":"Plant_nutrition"}
