{"title":"French colonial empire","summary":"The French colonial empire (French: Empire colonial français) comprised the overseas colonies, protectorates and mandate territories that came under French rule from the 16th century onward. A distinction is generally made between the \"First French Colonial Empire\", that existed until 1814, by which time most of it had been lost or sold, and the \"Second French Colonial Empire\", which began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830. At its apex, the Second French colonial empire was one of the largest empires in history. Including metropolitan France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached 11,500,000 km2 (4,400,000 sq mi) in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1936.","image":"Royal_Standard_of_the_King_of_France.svg.png.webp"}
