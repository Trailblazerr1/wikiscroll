{"title":"Multi-core processor","summary":"A multi-core processor is a computer processor on a single integrated circuit with two or more separate processing units, called cores, each of which reads and executes program instructions.[1] The instructions are ordinary CPU instructions (such as add, move data, and branch) but the single processor can run instructions on separate cores at the same time, increasing overall speed for programs that support multithreading or other parallel computing techniques.[2] Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die (known as a chip multiprocessor or CMP) or onto multiple dies in a single chip package.  The microprocessors currently used in almost all personal computers are multi-core.","image":"Dual_Core_Generic.svg.png.webp","url":"Multi-core_processor"}
