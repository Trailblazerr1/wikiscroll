{"title":"Purgatory","summary":"Purgatory (Latin: purgatorium, borrowed into English via Anglo-Norman and Old French)[1] is, according to the belief of some Christians (mostly Catholics), an intermediate state after physical death for expiatory purification.[2] The process of purgatory is the final purification of the elect, which is entirely different from the punishment of the damned.[3] Tradition, by reference to certain texts of scripture, sees the process as involving a cleansing fire. \nSome forms of Western Christianity, particularly within Protestantism, deny its existence. Other strands of Western Christianity see purgatory[4] as a place, perhaps filled with fire. Some concepts of Gehenna in Judaism resemble those of purgatory.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
