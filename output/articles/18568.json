{"title":"Government bond","summary":"A government bond or sovereign bond is an instrument of indebtedness (a bond) issued by a national government to support government spending. It generally includes a commitment to pay periodic interest, called coupon payments, and to repay the face value on the maturity date.\nFor example, a bondholder invests $20,000 (called face value) into a 10-year government bond with a 10% annual coupon; the government would pay the bondholder 10% of the $20,000 each year. At the maturity date the government would give back the original $20,000.","image":"Philippine-stock-market-board.jpg.webp"}
