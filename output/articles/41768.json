{"title":"Spiritualism","summary":"Spiritualism is a new religious movement based on the belief that the spirits of the dead exist and have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living.[1] The afterlife, or the \"spirit world\", is seen by spiritualists, not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to evolve. These two beliefs—that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits are more advanced than humans—lead spiritualists to a third belief: that spirits are capable of providing useful knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about the nature of God. Some spiritualists will speak of a concept which they refer to as \"spirit guides\"—specific spirits, often contacted, who are relied upon for spiritual guidance.[2][3] Emanuel Swedenborg has some claim to be the father of Spiritualism.[4] Spiritism, a branch of spiritualism developed by Allan Kardec and today practiced mostly in Continental Europe and Latin America, especially in Brazil, emphasizes reincarnation.[5]","image":"Spirit_rappings_coverpage_to_sheet_music_1853.jpg.webp","url":"Spiritualism"}
