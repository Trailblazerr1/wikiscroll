{"title":"Government debt","summary":"In public finance, government debt, also known as public interest, public debt, national debt and sovereign debt,[1][2] is the total amount of debt owed at a point in time by a government or sovereign state to lenders. Government debt can be owed to lenders within the country (also described as internal debt) or owed to foreign lenders (external debt). Government debt contrasts to the annual government budget deficit, which is a flow variable that equals the difference between government receipts and  spending in a single year. Government debt represents the accumulation of all prior  deficits. The government is typically required to pay interest on its debt.","image":"Government-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg.webp","url":"Government_debt"}
