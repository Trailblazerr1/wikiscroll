{"title":"Potential enlargement of the European Union","summary":"There are five recognised candidates for membership of the European Union: Turkey (applied in 1987), North Macedonia (applied in 2004), Montenegro (applied in 2008), Albania (applied in 2009) and Serbia (applied in 2009). All have started accession negotiations.[1] Kosovo (whose independence is not recognised by five EU member states) and Bosnia and Herzegovina are recognised as potential candidates for membership by the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina has formally submitted an application for membership, while Kosovo has a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, which generally precedes the lodging of a membership application. Montenegro and Serbia, the most advanced candidates, are both expected to join earlier than the rest.[2] While the others are progressing, Turkish (and to a lesser extent North Macedonian) talks are at an effective standstill.[3]","image":"Flag_of_Europe.svg.png.webp","url":"Potential_enlargement_of_the_European_Union"}
