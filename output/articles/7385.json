{"title":"Brachytherapy","summary":"Brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy where a sealed radiation source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment. Brachy is Greek for short.  Brachytherapy is commonly used as an effective treatment for cervical, prostate, breast, esophageal and skin cancer and can also be used to treat tumours in many other body sites.[1] Treatment results have demonstrated that the cancer-cure rates of brachytherapy are either comparable to surgery and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or are improved when used in combination with these techniques.[2][3][4] Brachytherapy can be used alone or in combination with other therapies such as surgery, EBRT and chemotherapy.","image":"Brachytherapybeads.png.webp","url":"Brachytherapy"}
