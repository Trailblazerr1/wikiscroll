{"title":"Death drive","summary":"In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive (German: Todestrieb) is the drive toward death and destruction, often expressed through behaviors such as aggression, repetition compulsion, and self-destructiveness.[1][2] It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\"[3][4] (Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens)[5] in 1912, which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. This concept has been translated as \"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\".[6] In Pleasure Principle, Freud used the plural \"death drives\" (Todestriebe) much more frequently than the singular.[7]","image":"Freud's_couch%2C_London%2C_2004_(2).jpeg.webp"}
