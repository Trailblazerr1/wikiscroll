Clobazam was originally marketed as an anxioselective anxiolytic since 1970,[2][3] and an anticonvulsant since 1984.[4] The primary drug-development goal was to provide greater anxiolytic, anti-obsessive efficacy with fewer benzodiazepine-related side effects.[2]","image":"Clobazam_structure.svg.png.webp","url":"Clobazam"}
