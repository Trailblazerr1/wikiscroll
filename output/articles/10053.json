{"title":"Circuit breaker","summary":"A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation.","image":"BreakerSymbols.svg.png.webp","url":"Circuit_breaker"}
