{"title":"Simulated reality","summary":"Simulated reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated—for example by quantum computer simulation—to a degree indistinguishable from \"true\" reality. It could contain conscious minds that may or may not know that they live inside a simulation. This is quite different from the current, technologically achievable concept of virtual reality, which is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality. Simulated reality, by contrast, would be hard or impossible to separate from \"true\" reality. There has been much debate over this topic, ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in computing.","image":"BrainGate.jpg.webp","url":"Simulated_reality"}
