{"title":"Octreotide","summary":"Octreotide, sold under the brand name Sandostatin (marketed by Novartis) among others, is an octapeptide that mimics natural somatostatin pharmacologically, though it is a more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than the natural hormone. It was first synthesized in 1979 by the chemist Wilfried Bauer, and binds predominantly to the somatostatin receptors SSTR2 and SSTR5.[3] It was approved for use in the United States in 1988.[2][1]","image":"Octreotide.svg.png.webp"}
