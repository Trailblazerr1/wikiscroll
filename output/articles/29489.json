{"title":"Metalloprotein","summary":"Metalloprotein is a generic term for a protein that contains a metal ion cofactor.[1][2] A large proportion of all proteins are part of this category. For instance, at least 1000 human proteins (out of ~20,000) contain zinc-binding protein domains[3] although there may be up to 3000 human zinc metalloproteins.[4]","image":"1GZX_Haemoglobin.png.webp","url":"Metalloprotein"}
