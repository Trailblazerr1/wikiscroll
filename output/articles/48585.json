{"title":"William Lyon Mackenzie","summary":"William Lyon Mackenzie[lower-alpha 1] (March 12, 1795 –  August 28, 1861) was a Scottish-born Canadian-American journalist and politician. He founded newspapers critical of the Family Compact, a term used to identify elite members of Upper Canada. He represented York County in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and aligned with Reformers. He led the rebels in the Upper Canada Rebellion; after its defeat, he rallied American support for an unsuccessful invasion of Upper Canada as part of the Patriot War. He rose in popularity after his criticism of government officials, but failed to implement most of his policy objectives. He is one of the most recognizable Reformers of the early 19th century.","image":"WilliamLyonMackenzie.jpeg.webp"}
