{"title":"Adult animation","summary":"Adult animation (also known as mature animation) is any type of animated motion work that is catered specifically to adult interests, and is mainly targeted and marketed towards adults and adolescents, as opposed to children or all-ages audiences. Works in this medium could be considered adult for any number of reasons, which include the incorporation of explicit or suggestive sexual content, graphic violence, profane language, dark humour, or other thematic elements inappropriate for children. Works in this genre may explore philosophical, political, or social issues. Some productions are noted for their complex and/or experimental storytelling and animation techniques. This includes animated films, television series, and web series.","image":"Adam_de_la_Pena-Comic-Con-2007-07-26_14.47.22.jpg.webp","url":"Adult_animation"}
