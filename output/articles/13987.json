{"title":"East African Community","summary":"The East African Community (EAC) is an intergovernmental organisation composed of six countries in the African Great Lakes region in eastern Africa: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. Uhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya, is the EAC's chairman. The organisation was founded in 1967, collapsed in 1977, and was revived on 7 July 2000.[6] In 2008, after negotiations with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), the EAC agreed to an expanded free trade area including the member states of all three organizations. The EAC is an integral part of the African Economic Community. The capital of the EAC is Arusha, while the most populous city is Dar es Salaam, both of which are in Tanzania.","image":"Flag_of_the_East_African_Community.svg.png.webp","url":"East_African_Community"}
