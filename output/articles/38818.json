{"title":"Rwandan genocide","summary":"The Rwandan genocide[4] occurred between 7 April and 15 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War.[5] During this period of around 100 days, members of the Tutsi minority ethnic group, as well as some moderate Hutu and Twa, were slaughtered by armed militias. The most widely accepted scholarly estimates are around 500,000 to 800,000 Tutsi deaths.[6] Estimates for the total death toll (including Hutu and Twa victims) are as high as 1,100,000.[3]","image":"Nyamata_Memorial_Site_13.jpg.webp","url":"Rwandan_genocide"}
