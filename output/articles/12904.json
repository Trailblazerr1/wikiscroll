{"title":"Dictatorship","summary":"A dictatorship is a form of government characterized by a single leader (dictator) or group of leaders that hold government power promised to the people and little or no toleration for political pluralism or independent media.[2] In most dictatorships, the country's constitution promise citizens rights and the freedom to free and democratic elections; sometimes, it also mentions that all these aforementioned rights will be granted to the people, but this is not always the case. As democracy is a form of government in which \"those who govern are selected through periodically contested elections (in years)\", dictatorships are not democracies.[2]","image":"Hitlermusso2_edit.jpg.webp"}
