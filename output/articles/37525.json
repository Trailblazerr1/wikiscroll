{"title":"Reichsmark","summary":"The Reichsmark (German: [ˈʁaɪ̯çsˌmaɐ̯k] (listen); sign: ℛℳ or RM) was the currency of Germany from 1924 until 20 June 1948 in West Germany, where it was replaced with the Deutsche Mark, and until 23 June 1948 in East Germany, where it was replaced by the East German mark. The Reichsmark was subdivided into 100 Reichspfennigs (rpf[1] or ℛ₰). The Mark is an ancient Germanic weight measure, traditionally a half pound, later used for several coins; whereas Reich (realm in English), comes from the official name for the German state from 1871 to 1945, Deutsches Reich.","image":"2ReichsMark.JPG.webp","url":"Reichsmark"}
