{"title":"Integrated Services Digital Network","summary":"Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the digitalised circuits of the public switched telephone network.[1] Work on the standard began in 1980 at Bell Labs and was formally standardized in 1988 in the CCITT \"Red Book\".[2] By the time the standard was released, newer networking systems with much greater speeds were available, and ISDN saw relatively little uptake in the wider market. One estimate suggests ISDN use peaked at a worldwide total of 25 million subscribers at a time when 1.3 billion analog lines were in use.[3] ISDN has largely been replaced with digital subscriber line (DSL) systems of much higher performance.","image":"ISDN_telefono.jpg.webp"}
