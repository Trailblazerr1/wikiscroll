{"title":"Final Fantasy II","summary":"Final Fantasy II[lower-alpha 1] is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) in 1988 for the Family Computer as the second installment of the Final Fantasy series. The game has received numerous enhanced remakes for the WonderSwan Color, the PlayStation, the Game Boy Advance, the PlayStation Portable, PC and multiple mobile and smartphone types. As neither this game nor Final Fantasy III were initially released outside Japan, Final Fantasy IV was originally released in North America as Final Fantasy II, so as not to confuse players. Following enhanced versions for iOS and Android in 2010 and 2012 respectively, the game was rereleased again as part of the 2021 Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series.[4]","image":"Ff2cover.jpg.webp","url":"Final_Fantasy_II"}
