{"title":"Sexually transmitted infection","summary":"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), also referred to as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and the older term venereal disease, are infections that are spread by sexual activity, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex and oral sex.[1][5] STIs often do not initially cause symptoms,[1] which results in a  risk of passing the infection on to others.[6][7] Symptoms and signs of STIs may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain.[1]  Some STIs can cause infertility.[1]","image":"Syphilis_is_a_dangerous_disease.png.webp","url":"Sexually_transmitted_infection"}
