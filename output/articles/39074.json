{"title":"Sakha","summary":"Sakha, also known as Yakutia or Yakutiya,[9][lower-alpha 1] is a republic of Russia. It is situated in the Russian Far East, along the Arctic Ocean, with a population of roughly 1 million.[10] Sakha comprises half of the area of its governing Far Eastern Federal District, and is the world's largest country subdivision, covering over 3,083,523 square kilometers (1,190,555 sq mi).[11] Yakutsk, which is the world's coldest large city,[12] is its capital and largest city. The republic has a reputation for an extreme and severe climate, with the lowest temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere being recorded in Verkhoyansk and Oymyakon, and regular winter averages commonly dipping below −35 °C (−31 °F) in Yakutsk. The hypercontinental tendencies also result in warm summers for much of the republic.","image":"Flag_of_Sakha.svg.png.webp"}
