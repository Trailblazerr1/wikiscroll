{"title":"P. G. Wodehouse bibliography","summary":"Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, KBE (/ˈwʊdhaʊs/; 1881–1975) was a prolific English author, humorist and scriptwriter. After being educated at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life, he was employed by a bank, but disliked the work and wrote magazine pieces in his spare time.[1] In 1902 he published his first novel, The Pothunters, set at the fictional public school of St. Austin's; his early stories continued the school theme. He also used the school setting in his short story collections, which started in 1903 with the publication of Tales of St. Austin's.[2]","image":"Wodehouse_with_Gest_Comstock_Bolton_and_Kern_circa_1917.jpg.webp"}
