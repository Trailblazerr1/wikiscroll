{"title":"Tsar","summary":"Tsar (/zɑːr, sɑːr/ or /tsɑːr/), also spelled czar, tzar, or csar, is a title used to designate East and South Slavic monarchs. In this last capacity it lends its name to a system of government, tsarist autocracy or tsarism. The term is derived from the Latin word caesar,[2] which was intended to mean \"emperor\" in the European medieval sense of the term—a ruler with the same rank as a Roman emperor, holding it by the approval of another emperor or a supreme ecclesiastical official (the Pope or the Ecumenical Patriarch)—but was usually considered by western Europeans to be equivalent to \"king\".[3][4]","image":"Car_Simeon_Bulharsky_-_Alfons_Mucha.jpg.webp","url":"Tsar"}
