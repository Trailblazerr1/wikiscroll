{"title":"Nothin' on You","summary":"\"Nothin' on You\" is the debut single of both American rapper B.o.B and American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars, from B.o.B's debut studio album, B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray (2010). It was first released on December 15, 2009, via digital download by Atlantic Records. The track was written by B.o.B and its producers Mars, Philip Lawrence, and Ari Levine of the Smeezingtons.  \"Nothin' on You\" was initially written for Lupe Fiasco, but Atlantic Records' chairman, Craig Kallman, gave it to B.o.B after being displeased with Fiasco's version. The song took several months to finish and was born from a hummed melody by Mars and Lawrence.","image":"Bobnothinonyou.jpg.webp","url":"Nothin'_on_You"}
