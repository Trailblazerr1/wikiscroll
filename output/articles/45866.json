{"title":"Treaty of Waitangi","summary":"The Treaty of Waitangi (Māori: Te Tiriti o Waitangi) is a treaty first signed on 6 February 1840 by representatives of the British Crown and Māori chiefs (rangatira) from the North Island of New Zealand. It has become a document of central importance to the history, to the political constitution of the state, and to the national mythos of New Zealand, and has played a major role in framing the political relations between New Zealand's government and the Māori population, especially from the late 20th century.","image":"Treatyofwaitangi.jpg.webp","url":"Treaty_of_Waitangi"}
