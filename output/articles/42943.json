{"title":"Suspensory muscle of duodenum","summary":"The suspensory muscle of duodenum is a thin muscle connecting the junction between the duodenum, jejunum, and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery. It is also known as the ligament of Treitz.[1] The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.","image":"Duodenumanatomy.jpg.webp","url":"Suspensory_muscle_of_duodenum"}
