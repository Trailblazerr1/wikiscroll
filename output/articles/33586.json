{"title":"pH","summary":"In chemistry, pH (/piːˈeɪtʃ/, historically denoting \"potential of hydrogen\" (or “power of hydrogen\")[1] is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution. Acidic solutions (solutions with higher concentrations of H+ ions) are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions.","image":"PH_scale_3.jpg.webp"}
