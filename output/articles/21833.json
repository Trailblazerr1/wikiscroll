{"title":"Indian people","summary":"Indians are the nationals and citizens of India, the second most populous nation in the world, containing 17.50% of the world's population. In India, the term \"Indian\" refers to nationality, rather than a particular ethnicity or language; the Indian nationality consists of dozens of regional ethno-linguistic groups, reflecting the rich and complex history of the country. Due to emigration, the Indian diaspora is present throughout the world, notably in other parts of Asia, North America, Europe, the Caribbean, Oceania, and Africa.[4] The demonym Indian applies to nationals of the present-day Republic of India, but also to people residing outside of India, who are called Overseas Indians; before the partition of India in 1947, the demonym applied to all nationals residing in the entirety of British India (including what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh).[25][26]","image":"Flag_of_India.svg.png.webp","url":"Indian_people"}
