{"title":"Gobrecht dollar","summary":"The Gobrecht dollar, minted from 1836 to 1839, was the first silver dollar struck for circulation by the United States Mint since production of that denomination was officially halted in 1806 (the last silver dollars were struck in 1804 but dated 1803). The coin was struck in small numbers to determine whether the reintroduced silver dollar would be well received by the public.","image":"NNC-US-1836-1%24-Gobrecht_dollar_(plain_edge_%26_name).jpg.webp"}
