{"title":"Australian dollar","summary":"The Australian dollar (sign: $; code: AUD) is the currency of Australia, including its external territories: Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island. It is officially used as currency by three independent Pacific Island states: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. It is legal tender in Australia.[2] Within Australia, it is almost always abbreviated with the dollar sign ($), with A$ or AU$  sometimes used to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies.[3][4] The $ symbol precedes the amount. It is subdivided into 100 cents.","image":"Flag_of_Australia_(converted).svg.png.webp","url":"Australian_dollar"}
