{"title":"Motor neuron","summary":"A motor neuron (or motoneuron or efferent neuron[1]) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.[2]  There are two types of motor neuron â€“ upper motor neurons and lower motor neurons. Axons from upper motor neurons synapse onto interneurons in the spinal cord and occasionally directly onto lower motor neurons.[3] The axons from the lower motor neurons are efferent nerve fibers that carry signals from the spinal cord to the effectors.[4] Types of lower motor neurons are alpha motor neurons, beta motor neurons, and gamma motor neurons.","image":"Medulla_oblongata_-_posterior_-_cn_xii_-_very_high_mag.jpg.webp","url":"Motor_neuron"}
