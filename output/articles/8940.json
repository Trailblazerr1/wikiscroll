{"title":"Catholic theology of sexuality","summary":"Catholic theology of sexuality, like Catholic theology in general, is drawn from natural law,[1] canonical scripture, divine revelation, and sacred tradition, as interpreted authoritatively by the magisterium of the Catholic Church. Sexual morality evaluates sexual behavior according to standards laid out by Catholic moral theology, and often provides general principles by which Catholics can evaluate whether specific actions meet these standards.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp","url":"Catholic_theology_of_sexuality"}
