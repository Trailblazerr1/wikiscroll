{"title":"Intercrural sex","summary":"Intercrural sex, which is also known as coitus interfemoris, thigh sex and interfemoral sex, is a type of non-penetrative sex in which the penis is placed between the receiving partner's thighs and friction is generated via thrusting. It was a common practice in ancient Greek society prior to the early centuries AD, and was frequently discussed by writers and portrayed in artwork such as vases. It later became subject to sodomy laws and became increasingly seen as contemptible. In the 17th century, intercrural sex was featured in multiple pieces of literature and it took cultural prominence, being seen as a part of male-on-male sexual habits following the trial of Mervyn Tuchet.","image":"Intercrural_Sex%2C_Vase.jpg.webp","url":"Intercrural_sex"}
