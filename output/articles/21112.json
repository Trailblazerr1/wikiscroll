{"title":"Hunting","summary":"Hunting is the practice of seeking, pursuing and capturing or killing wildlife or feral animals.[10] The most common reasons for humans to hunt are to harvest useful animal products (meat, fur/hide, bone/tusks, horn/antler, etc), for recreation/taxidermy (see trophy hunting), to remove predators dangerous to humans or domestic animals (e.g. wolf hunting), to eliminate pests and nuisance animals that damage crops/livestock/poultry or spread diseases (see varminting), for trade/tourism (see safari), or for ecological conservation against overpopulation and invasive species (see culling).","image":"Paul_Childerley_driven_hunt_Finland_04.png.webp"}
