{"title":"Thomas the Apostle","summary":"Thomas the Apostle (Biblical Hebrew: תוֹמָאס הקדוש‎; Ancient Greek: Θωμᾶς; Coptic: ⲑⲱⲙⲁⲥ; Classical Syriac: ܬܐܘܡܐ ܫܠܝܚܐ‎ Tʾōmā šliḥā; Hindi: सेंट थॉमस Seṇṭ thômas; Tamil: புனித தோமையர் Puṉita tōmaiyar Malayalam: മാര്‍ തോമാ ശ്ലീഹ Mār tōmā ślīha), also called Didymus (\"twin\") was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. Thomas is commonly known as \"Doubting Thomas\" because he initially doubted the resurrection of Jesus Christ when he was told of it (as is related in the Gospel of John alone); he later confessed his faith (\"My Lord and my God\") on seeing the wounds left over from the crucifixion.","image":"Syro-Malabar_icon_of_Throne_of_Mar_Thoma.jpg.webp"}
