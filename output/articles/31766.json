{"title":"Neutron radiation","summary":"Neutron radiation is a form of ionizing radiation that presents as free neutrons. Typical phenomena are  nuclear fission or nuclear fusion causing the release of free neutrons, which then react with nuclei of other atoms to form new isotopesâ€”which, in turn, may trigger further neutron radiation.  Free neutrons are unstable, decaying into a proton, an electron, plus an electron antineutrino with a mean lifetime of 887 seconds (14 minutes, 47 seconds).[1]","image":"Quark_structure_neutron.svg.png.webp"}
