{"title":"Pubic symphysis","summary":"The pubic symphysis is a secondary cartilaginous joint between the left and right superior rami of the pubis of the hip bones. It is in front of and below the urinary bladder. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is close to the clitoris. In most adults it can be moved roughly 2Â mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth.[1]","image":"Gray321.png.webp","url":"Pubic_symphysis"}
