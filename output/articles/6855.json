{"title":"Blackburn Olympic F.C.","summary":"Blackburn Olympic Football Club was an English football club based in Blackburn, Lancashire in the late 19th century.  Although the club was only in existence for just over a decade, it is significant in the history of football in England as the first club from the north of the country and the first from a working-class background to win the country's leading competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup). The cup had previously been won only by teams of wealthy amateurs from the Home counties, and Olympic's victory marked a turning point in the sport's transition from a pastime for upper-class gentlemen to a professional sport.","image":"Blackburn_Olympic_1883.jpg.webp"}
