{"title":"Apomixis","summary":"In botany, apomixis is asexual reproduction without fertilization.[1] Its etymology is Greek for \"away from\" + \"mixing\". This definition notably does not mention meiosis. Thus \"normal asexual reproduction\" of plants, such as propagation from cuttings or leaves, has never been considered to be apomixis, but replacement of the seed by a plantlet or replacement of the flower by bulbils were categorized as types of apomixis. Apomictically produced offspring are genetically identical to the parent plant.","image":"Poa_bulbosa%2C_vegetative_apomixis.jpg.webp","url":"Apomixis"}
