{"title":"Fu (poetry)","summary":"Fu (Chinese: 賦), often translated \"rhapsody\" or \"poetic exposition\", is a form of Chinese rhymed prose that was the dominant literary form during the Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 220).  Fu are intermediary pieces between poetry and prose in which a place, object, feeling, or other subject is described and rhapsodized in exhaustive detail and from as many angles as possible.[2] Features characteristic of fu include alternating rhyme and prose, varying line length, close alliteration, onomatopoeia, loose parallelism, and extensive cataloging of their topics.[3] They were often composed using as wide a vocabulary as possible, and so classical fu usually include many rare and archaic Chinese words.[4] They were not sung like songs, but were recited or chanted.[5]","image":"Liangyuan_Gathering.jpg.webp","url":"Fu_(poetry)"}
