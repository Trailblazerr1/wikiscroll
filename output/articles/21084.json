{"title":"Humus","summary":"In soil science, humus (derived in 1790â€“1800 from the Latin humus for 'earth, ground'[1]) denominates the fraction of soil organic matter that is amorphous and without the \"cellular cake structure characteristic of plants, micro-organisms or animals\".[2] Humus significantly affects the bulk density of soil and contributes to its retention of moisture and nutrients. Although the terms humus and compost are informally used interchangeably, they are distinct soil components with different origins; humus is created through anaerobic fermentation, while compost is the result of aerobic decomposition.","image":"Horizons.gif","url":"Humus"}
