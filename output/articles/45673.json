{"title":"Trace fossil","summary":"A trace fossil, also ichnofossil ( /ˈɪknoʊfɒsɪl/; from Greek: ἴχνος ikhnos \"trace, track\"), is a fossil record of biological activity but not the preserved remains of the plant or animal itself. Trace fossils contrast with body fossils, which are the fossilized remains of parts of organisms' bodies, usually altered by later chemical activity or mineralization. The study of such trace fossils is ichnology and is the work of ichnologists.","image":"Cheirotherium_prints_possibly_Ticinosuchus.JPG.webp","url":"Trace_fossil"}
