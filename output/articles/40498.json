{"title":"Short-term effects of alcohol consumption","summary":"The short-term effects of alcohol (more specifically ethanol) consumption range from a decrease in anxiety and motor skills and euphoria at lower doses to intoxication (drunkenness), stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia (memory \"blackouts\"), and central nervous system depression at higher doses. Cell membranes are highly permeable to alcohol, so once alcohol is in the bloodstream, it can diffuse into nearly every cell in the body.","image":"HarmCausedByDrugsTable.svg.png.webp","url":"Short-term_effects_of_alcohol_consumption"}
