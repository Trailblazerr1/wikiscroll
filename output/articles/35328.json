{"title":"Poker","summary":"Poker is a family of card games in which players wager over which hand is best according to that specific game's rules in ways similar to these rankings. While the earliest known form of the game was played with just 20 cards, today it is usually played with a standard deck, although countries where short packs are common, may play with 32, 40 or 48 cards.[1] Thus poker games vary in deck configuration, the number of cards in play, the number dealt face up or face down, and the number shared by all players, but all have rules that involve one or more rounds of betting.","image":"US_Navy_090620-N-2798F-033_Sailors_assigned_to_the_aircraft_carrier_USS_Harry_S._Truman_(CVN_75)_and_Carrier_Air_Wing_(CVW)_3_compete_in_a_Texas_Hold_'Em_Poker_tournament_aboard_Harry_S._Truman.jpg.webp","url":"Poker"}
