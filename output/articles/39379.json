{"title":"Santería","summary":"Santería (Spanish pronunciation: [san̪.t̪eˈɾi.a]), also known as Regla de Ocha, Regla Lucumí, or Lucumí, is an African diasporic religion that developed in Cuba during the late 19th century. It arose through a process of syncretism between the traditional Yoruba religion of West Africa, the Roman Catholic form of Christianity, and Spiritism. There is no central authority in control of Santería and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as creyentes (\"believers\").","image":"Havana_-_Cuba_-_0616.jpg.webp","url":"Santería"}
