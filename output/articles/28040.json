{"title":"Maharaja","summary":"Mahārāja (/ˌmɑːhəˈrɑːdʒə/; also spelled Maharajah, Maharaj) is a Sanskrit title for a \"great ruler\", \"great king\" or \"high king\".[1] A few ruled mighty states informally called empires, including ruler raja Sri Gupta, founder of the ancient Indian Gupta Empire, and Chandragupta Maurya.[2] 'Title inflation' soon led to most being rather mediocre or even petty in real power, which led to compound titles (among other efforts) being used in an attempt to distinguish some among their ranks.","image":"HH_Sri_Chamarajendra_Wadiyar_X.jpg.webp","url":"Maharaja"}
