{"title":"Iridium","summary":"Iridium is a chemical element with the symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is considered to be the second-densest naturally occurring metal (after osmium) with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography.[lower-alpha 1] It is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.","image":"Iridium-2.jpg.webp"}
