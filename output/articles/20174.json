{"title":"Heritability","summary":"Heritability is a statistic used in the fields of breeding and genetics that estimates the degree of variation in a phenotypic trait in a population that is due to genetic variation between individuals in that population.[1] It measures how much of the variation of a trait can be attributed to variation of genetic factors, as opposed to variation of environmental factors. The concept of heritability can be expressed in the form of the following question: \"What is the proportion of the variation in a given trait within a population that is not explained by the environment or random chance?\"[2]","image":"Critique_of_the_Theory_of_Evolution_Fig_076.jpg.webp","url":"Heritability"}
