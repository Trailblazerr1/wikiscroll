{"title":"I'jaz","summary":"In Islam, ’i‘jāz (Arabic: اَلْإِعْجَازُ‎, romanized: al-’i‘jāz) or inimitability of the Qur’ān is the doctrine which holds that the Qur’ān has a miraculous quality, both in content and in form, that no human speech can match.[1] According to this doctrine the Qur'an is a miracle and its inimitability is the proof granted to Muhammad in authentication of his prophetic status. It serves the dual purpose of proving the authenticity of its divineness as being a source from the creator; and proving the genuineness of Muhammad's prophethood to whom it was revealed as he was one bringing the message.","image":"16th_century_Koran_folio_from_Iran_(detail).png.webp"}
