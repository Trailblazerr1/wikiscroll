{"title":"The Low End Theory","summary":"The Low End Theory is the second studio album by American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on September 24, 1991, by Jive Records. Recording sessions for the album were held mostly at Battery Studios in New York City, from 1990 to 1991. The album was primarily produced by group member Q-Tip, in a departure from the group's debut album, People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm (1990), with a minimalist sound that combines bass, drum breaks, and jazz samples. Lyrically, the album features social commentary, word play, humor, and interplay between group members Q-Tip and Phife Dawg.","image":"ATribeCalledQuestTheLowEndtheory.jpg.webp","url":"The_Low_End_Theory"}
