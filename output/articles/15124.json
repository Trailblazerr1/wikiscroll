{"title":"Ersatz Yorck-class battlecruiser","summary":"The Ersatz Yorck class was a group of three battlecruisers ordered but not completed for the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in 1916. The three ships had originally been ordered as additions to the  Mackensen class, but developments abroad, particularly the British  Renown-class battlecruisers, led to the navy re-designing the ships. The primary change was an increase of the main battery from eight 35-centimeter (14 in) guns to eight 38 cm (15 in) weapons. Work on the first ship had already begun by the time the navy decided to re-design the ships, so the design staff was constrained by the need to use the material already assembled.","image":"SMS_Ersatz_Yorck_line_color-aaa3.png.webp"}
