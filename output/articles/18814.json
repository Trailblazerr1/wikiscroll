{"title":"Great Red Spot","summary":"The Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm that is the largest in the Solar System. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to 432 km/h (268 mph). Observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be of the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 356 years.[1] It was next observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began.[2][3]","image":"Jupiters_iconic_Great_Red_Spot.jpg.webp","url":"Great_Red_Spot"}
