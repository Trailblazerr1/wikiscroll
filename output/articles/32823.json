It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture.[2][3] It is also unique in that a majority of its structures are made of brick, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S.[3] Many of the buildings are in the Victorian-era styles of Romanesque, Queen Anne, Italianate, among others; and many blocks have had few or no buildings razed. There are also several 20th-century buildings from 15 to 20 stories.","image":"Werne's_Row_4th_and_Hill%2C_Old_Louisville.jpg.webp"}
