{"title":"SMS Hindenburg","summary":"SMS Hindenburg[lower-alpha 1] was a battlecruiser of the German Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy), the third ship of the  Derfflinger class, built to a slightly modified design. She carried the same battery of eight 30.5 cm (12 in) guns, but in improved turrets that allowed them to fire further. The ship was also slightly larger and faster than her two sister ships. She was named in honor of Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, the victor of the Battle of Tannenberg and the Battle of the Masurian Lakes, as well as Supreme Commander of the German armies from 1916. The ship was the last capital ship of any type built for the German navy during World War I.","image":"Hindenburg_scapa.jpg.webp"}
