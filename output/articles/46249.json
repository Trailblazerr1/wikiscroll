{"title":"Twister (game)","summary":"Twister is a game of physical skill produced by Milton Bradley Company and Winning Moves Games USA. It is played on a large plastic mat that is spread on the floor or ground. The mat has six rows of large colored circles on it with a different color in each row: red, yellow, green, and blue. A spinner is attached to a square board and is used to determine where the player has to put their hand or foot. The spinner is divided into four labeled sections: left foot, right foot, left hand, and right hand. Each of those four sections are divided into the four colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). After spinning, the combination is called (for example: \"right hand yellow\") and players must move their matching hand or foot to a circle of the correct color. The game promotes itself as \"the game that ties you up in knots\".","image":"1966_Twister_Cover.jpg.webp"}
