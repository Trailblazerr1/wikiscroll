{"title":"Newfoundland dog","summary":"The Newfoundland is a large working dog. They can be either black, brown, grey, or white and black. However, in the Dominion of Newfoundland, before it became part of the confederation of Canada, only black and Landseer (white-and-black) coloured dogs were considered to be proper members of the breed.[2] They were originally bred and used as working dogs for fishermen in Newfoundland.[3][4] Newfoundlands are known for their giant size, intelligence, tremendous strength, calm dispositions, and loyalty. They excel at water rescue/lifesaving because of their muscular build, thick double coat, webbed paws, and swimming abilities.
