{"title":"Coeliac disease","summary":"Coeliac disease or celiac disease is a long-term autoimmune disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine, where individuals develop intolerance to gluten, present in foods such as wheat, rye and barley.[10] Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and among children failure to grow normally.[1] This often begins between six months and two years of age.[1] Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years.[8][15][16] There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body, or no obvious symptoms.[1] Coeliac disease was first described in childhood;[6][8] however, it may develop at any age.[1][8] It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, among others.[6]","image":"Coeliac_path.jpg.webp"}
