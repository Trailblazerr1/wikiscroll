{"title":"Peace dollar","summary":"The Peace dollar is a United States dollar coin minted for circulation from 1921 to 1928 and in 1934 and 1935, and beginning again in 2021. Designed by Anthony de Francisci, the coin was the result of a competition to find designs emblematic of peace. Its obverse represents the head and neck of the Goddess of Liberty in profile, and the reverse depicts a bald eagle at rest clutching an olive branch, with the legend \"Peace\". It was the last United States dollar coin to be struck for circulation in silver.","image":"NNC-US-1921-1%24-Peace_dollar.jpg.webp"}
