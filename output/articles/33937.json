{"title":"Parish","summary":"A parish is a territorial entity in many Christian denominations, constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a priest, often termed a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor. Its association with the parish church remains paramount.[1]","image":"St_James's_Church%2C_Manorbier_-_geograph.org.uk_-_928738.jpg.webp","url":"Parish"}
