{"title":"Hebron","summary":"Hebron (Arabic: الخليل أو الخليل الرحمن‎ al-Khalīl or al-Khalil al-Rahman;[4] Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן‎ Ḥevrōn) is a Palestinian[5][6][7][8] city in the southern West Bank, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies 930 metres (3,050 ft) above sea level. The largest city in the West Bank, and the second largest in the Palestinian territories after Gaza, it has a population of over 215,000 Palestinians (2016),[9] and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of the Old City of Hebron.[10] It includes the Cave of the Patriarchs, which Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions all designate as the burial site of three key patriarchal/matriarchal couples.[10] Judaism ranks Hebron the second-holiest city after Jerusalem,[11] while some Muslims regard it as one of the four holy cities.[12][13][14][15]","image":"Hebron172.JPG.webp","url":"Hebron"}
