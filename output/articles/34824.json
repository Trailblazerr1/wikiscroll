{"title":"Phimosis","summary":"Phimosis is a condition in which the ridged band of the akroposthion of the foreskin of the penis cannot stretch to allow it to be pulled back past the glans.[3] A balloon-like swelling under the foreskin may occur with urination.[3] In teenagers and adults, it may result in pain during an erection, but is otherwise not painful.[3] Those affected are at greater risk of inflammation of the glans, known as balanitis, and other complications.[3]","image":"Fimosis_perfil.jpg.webp"}
