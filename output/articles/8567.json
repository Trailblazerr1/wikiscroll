{"title":"Carbon tetrafluoride","summary":"Tetrafluoromethane, also known as carbon tetrafluoride or R-14, is the simplest perfluorocarbon (CF4). As its IUPAC name indicates, tetrafluoromethane is the perfluorinated counterpart to the hydrocarbon methane. It can also be classified as a haloalkane or halomethane. Tetrafluoromethane is a useful refrigerant but also a potent greenhouse gas.[3] It has a very high bond strength due to the nature of the carbonâ€“fluorine bond.","image":"Carbon-tetrafluoride-2D-dimensions.png.webp"}
