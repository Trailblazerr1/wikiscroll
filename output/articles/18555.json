{"title":"Gotland","summary":"Gotland (/ˈɡɒtlənd/, Swedish: [ˈɡɔ̌tːland] (listen);[4] Gutland in the local dialect[5]), also historically spelled Gottland or Gothland (/ˈɡɒθlənd/),[6] is Sweden's largest island.[7][8][9][10] It is also a province, county, municipality, and diocese. The province includes the islands of Fårö and Gotska Sandön to the north, as well as the Karlsö Islands (Lilla and Stora) to the west. The population is 58,595,[2] of which about 23,600 live in Visby, the main town.[1] Outside Visby, there are minor settlements and a mainly rural population. The island of Gotland and the other areas of the province of Gotland make up less than one percent of Sweden's total land area. The county formed by the archipelago is the second smallest by area and is the least populated in Sweden. In spite of the small size due to its narrow width, the driving distance between the furthermost points of the populated islands is about 170 kilometres (110 mi).[11]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
