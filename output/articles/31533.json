{"title":"Nazi plunder","summary":"Nazi plunder (Raubkunst in German) was the stealing of art and other items which occurred as a result of the organized looting of European countries during the time of the Third Reich by agents who acted on behalf of the ruling Nazi Party of Germany. The looting of Jewish property was a key part of the Holocaust. The plundering was carried out from 1933, beginning with the seizure of the property of German Jews, until the end of World War II, particularly by military units which were known as the Kunstschutz, although most of the plunder was acquired during the war. In addition to gold, silver and currency, cultural items of great significance were stolen, including paintings, ceramics, books and religious treasures.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-729-0001-23%2C_Italien%2C_Überführung_von_Kunstschätzen.jpg.webp"}
