{"title":"Ziggurat","summary":"A ziggurat (/ˈzɪɡʊˌræt/; Akkadian: ziqquratu,[2] D-stem of zaqāru 'to protrude, to build high',[3] cognate with other Semitic languages like Hebrew zaqar (זָקַר) 'protrude'[4][5]) is a type of massive structure built in ancient Mesopotamia. It has the form of a terraced compound of successively receding stories or levels. Notable ziggurats include the Great Ziggurat of Ur near Nasiriyah, the Ziggurat of Aqar Quf near Baghdad, the now destroyed Etemenanki in Babylon, Chogha Zanbil in Khūzestān and Sialk. The Sumerians believed that the Gods lived in the temple at the top of the Ziggurats, so only priests and other highly respected individuals could enter. Society offered them many things such as music, harvest, and creating devotional statues to leave in the temple.","image":"White_Temple_ziggurat_in_Uruk.jpg.webp","url":"Ziggurat"}
