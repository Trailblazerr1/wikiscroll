{"title":"Allotment (gardening)","summary":"An allotment garden (British English),[1] often called simply an allotment, or in North America, a community garden, is a plot of land made available for individual, non-commercial gardening or growing food plants. Such plots are formed by subdividing a piece of land into a few or up to several hundred parcels that are assigned to individuals or families. Such parcels are cultivated individually, contrary to other community garden types where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people.[2] In countries that do not use the term \"allotment (garden)\", a \"community garden\" may refer to individual small garden plots as well as to a single, large piece of land gardened collectively by a group of people. The term \"victory garden\" is also still sometimes used, especially when a community garden dates back to the First or Second World War.","image":"Zürich_-_Käferberg_-_Affoltern_IMG_3194.JPG.webp","url":"Allotment_(gardening)"}
