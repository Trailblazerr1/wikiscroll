{"title":"Technological singularity","summary":"The technological singularity—or simply the singularity[1]—is a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.[2][3] According to the most popular version of the singularity hypothesis, called intelligence explosion, an upgradable intelligent agent will eventually enter a \"runaway reaction\" of self-improvement cycles, each new and more intelligent generation appearing more and more rapidly, causing an \"explosion\" in intelligence and resulting in a powerful superintelligence that qualitatively far surpasses all human intelligence.","image":"FuturesStudies.svg.png.webp"}
