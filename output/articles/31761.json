{"title":"Neutering","summary":"Neutering, from the Latin neuter ('of neither sex'),[1] is the removal of an animal's reproductive organ, either all of it or a considerably large part. \"Neutering\" is often used incorrectly to refer only to male animals, but the term actually applies to both sexes. The male-specific term is castration, while spaying is usually reserved for female animals. Colloquially, both terms are often referred to as fixing.[2] In male horses, castrating is referred to as gelding. An animal that has not been neutered is sometimes referred to as entire or intact.","image":"Spay_1.JPG.webp"}
