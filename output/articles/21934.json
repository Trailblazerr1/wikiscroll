{"title":"Inertial frame of reference","summary":"In classical physics and special relativity, an inertial frame of reference  is a frame of reference that is not undergoing acceleration. In an inertial frame of reference, a physical object with zero net force acting on it moves with a constant velocity (which might be zero)â€”or, equivalently, it is a frame of reference in which Newton's first law of motion holds.[1][2] An inertial frame of reference can be defined in analytical terms as a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner.[3] Conceptually, the physics of a system in an inertial frame have no causes external to the system.[4] An inertial frame of reference may also be called an inertial reference frame, inertial frame, Galilean reference frame, or inertial space.[5]","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Inertial_frame_of_reference"}
