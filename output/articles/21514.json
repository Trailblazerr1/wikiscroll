{"title":"Ibn Taymiyyah","summary":"Taqī ad-Dīn ʾAḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm ibn ʿAbd al-Salām al-Numayrī al-Ḥarrānī (Arabic: تقي الدين أحمد بن عبد الحليم بن عبد السلام النميري الحراني‎, January 22, 1263 – September 26, 1328), known simply Ibn Taymiyyah (ابن تيمية),[24][25] was a Sunni Islamic scholar,[26] muhaddith, theologian, judge, philosopher,[27][28] and sometimes controversial thinker and political figure.[29][26] He is known for his diplomatic involvement with the Ilkhanid ruler Ghazan Khan and for his involvement at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar which ended the Mongol invasions of the Levant.[30] A member of the Hanbali school, Ibn Taymiyyah's iconoclastic views on widely accepted doctrines of his time such as the veneration of saints and the visitation to their tomb-shrines made him unpopular with many scholars and rulers of the time, under whose orders he was imprisoned several times.[31]","image":"تخطيط_كلمة_ابن_تيمية.png.webp","url":"Ibn_Taymiyyah"}
