{"title":"Too Much Too Soon (album)","summary":"Too Much Too Soon is the second album by the American hard rock band New York Dolls. It was released on May 10, 1974, by Mercury Records. The Dolls recorded the album earlier that year at A&R Studios in New York City with veteran producer Shadow Morton, who was enlisted by the band's lead singer David Johansen after they felt dissatisfied with the recording of their 1973 self-titled debut album. Morton had been disenchanted by the music industry, but the band's energy motivated him to undertake the project as a challenge.","image":"Too_Much_Too_Soon_-_The_New_York_Dolls.jpg.webp","url":"Too_Much_Too_Soon_(album)"}
