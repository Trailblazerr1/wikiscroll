{"title":"1960 Winter Olympics","summary":"The 1960 Winter Olympics (officially the VIII Olympic Winter Games and also known as Squaw Valley 1960) were a winter multi-sport event held from February 18 to 29, 1960, at the Squaw Valley Resort (now known as  Palisades Tahoe)[1] in Squaw Valley, California, United States. The resort was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Squaw Valley was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US$80Â million between 1956 and 1960. The layout was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to reach most of the venues on foot.","image":"1960_Winter_Olympics_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"1960_Winter_Olympics"}
