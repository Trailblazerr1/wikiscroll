{"title":"Algebraic number","summary":"An algebraic number is a number that is a root of a non-zero polynomial in one variable with integer (or equivalently, rational) coefficients.  For example, the golden ratio, \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        1\n        +\n        \n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        )\n        \n          /\n        \n        2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (1+{\\sqrt {5}})/2}\n  \n, is an algebraic number, because it is a root of the polynomial x2 - x - 1. That is, it is a value for x for which the polynomial evaluates to zero.  As another example, the complex number \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        +\n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1+i}\n  \n is algebraic because it is a root of x4 + 4.","image":"8834bbd69c7f1eddf70573ed4296941c18c25ee5.svg"}
