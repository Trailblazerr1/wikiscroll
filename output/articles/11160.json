{"title":"Coprolite","summary":"A coprolite (also known as a coprolith) is fossilized feces. Coprolites are classified as trace fossils as opposed to body fossils, as they give evidence for the animal's behaviour (in this case, diet) rather than morphology. The name is derived from the Greek words κόπρος (kopros, meaning \"dung\") and λίθος (lithos, meaning \"stone\"). They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Prior to this they were known as \"fossil fir cones\" and \"bezoar stones\". They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms.[1] Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to over 60 centimetres.","image":"Palais_de_la_Decouverte_Tyrannosaurus_rex_p1050042.jpg.webp","url":"Coprolite"}
