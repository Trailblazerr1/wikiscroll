{"title":"Cysticercosis","summary":"Cysticercosis is a tissue infection caused by the young form of the pork tapeworm.[6][1] People may have few or no symptoms for years.[3][2] In some cases, particularly in Asia, solid lumps of between one and two centimetres may develop under the skin.[1] After months or years these lumps can become painful and swollen and then resolve.[3][2] A specific form called neurocysticercosis, which affects the brain, can cause neurological symptoms.[2] In developing countries this is one of the most common causes of seizures.[2]","image":"Neurocysticercosis.gif"}
