{"title":"Solomon","summary":"Solomon (/ˈsɒləmən/; Hebrew: שְׁלֹמֹה‎‎, Šəlōmō),[lower-alpha 1] also called Jedidiah (יְדִידְיָהּ‎‎, Yeḏīḏyāh), was, according to the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament,[3] a fabulously wealthy and wise monarch of the United Kingdom of Israel who succeeded his father, David.[4] The conventional dates of Solomon's reign are about 970–931 BCE, normally given in alignment with the dates of David's reign. He is described as a king of the United Monarchy, which broke apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone.[5]","image":"Berruguete%2C_Pedro_-_Salomon_-_c._1500.jpg.webp"}
