{"title":"Adverse possession","summary":"Adverse possession, sometimes colloquially described as \"squatter's rights\",[lower-alpha 1] is a legal principle in the Anglo-American common law under which a person who does not have legal title to a piece of property—usually land (real property)—may acquire legal ownership based on continuous possession or occupation of the property without the permission (licence) of its legal owner.[1] The possession by a person is not adverse if they are in possession as a tenant or licensee of the legal owner.","image":"page1-400px-Adverse_possession_US.pdf.jpg.webp"}
