{"title":"Buruli ulcer","summary":"Buruli ulcer (/bəˈruːli/)[2] is an infectious disease characterized by the development of painless open wounds. The disease is limited to certain areas of the world, most cases occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa and Australia. The first sign of infection is a small painless nodule or area of swelling, typically on the arms or legs. The nodule grows larger over days to weeks, eventually forming an open ulcer. Deep ulcers can cause scarring of muscles and tendons, resulting in permanent disability.","image":"Buruli_ulcers_grouped_image.png.webp","url":"Buruli_ulcer"}
