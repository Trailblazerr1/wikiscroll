{"title":"List of NBA All-Stars","summary":"The National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is an annual exhibition basketball game. It is the main event of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Originally, the All-Star Game featured a conference-based format, featuring a team composed of all of the top ranked basketball players in the Eastern Conference and another team of all-stars from the Western Conference. Prior to the 2018 NBA All-Star Game, the NBA changed the format to feature two teams captained by the top leading vote-getter from each conference. Following the selection of the all-star starters and reserves, the captains choose from a pool of all-stars to form their teams regardless of conference. Twelve players—five starters and seven reserves—from each conference are chosen from what used to be a pool of 120 players—60 players from each conference with 24 guards and 24 frontcourts (forwards and centers)—listed on the ballots by a panel of sport writers and broadcasters to all active players. The starters are chosen by a combination of fans, media, and current players. Fans may vote using a variety of online platforms, and account for 50% of the vote, with the media and current players each accounting for 25%.[1] The reserves are chosen by voting among the head coaches of each team's particular conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players, and can select two guards, three front court players, and two players regardless of positions.[2] If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the NBA commissioner will select a replacement.[3] The 1999 All-Star Game was canceled due to the league's lockout.[4]","image":"Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar_Lipofsky.jpg.webp"}
