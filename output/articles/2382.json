{"title":"Agave","summary":"Agave (/əˈɡɑːvi/, UK also /əˈɡeɪvi/,[2] Anglo-Hispanic: /əˈɡɑːveɪ/)[3] is a genus of monocots native to the hot and arid regions of the Americas, although some Agave species are also native to tropical areas of South America. The genus Agave (from the Ancient Greek αγαυή, agauê)[4] is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves.[5] Agave now includes species formerly placed in a number of other genera, such as Manfreda, ×Mangave, Polianthes and Prochnyanthes.","image":"Agave_americana_R01.jpg.webp","url":"Agave"}
