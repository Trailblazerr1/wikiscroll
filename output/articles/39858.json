{"title":"Second Ladies and Gentlemen of the United States","summary":"The second lady of the United States (SLOTUS) or second gentleman of the United States (SGOTUS) is the informal title held by the spouse of the vice president of the United States, concurrent with the vice president's term of office. Coined in contrast to \"first lady\", albeit used less commonly, the title \"second lady\" was apparently first used by Jennie Tuttle Hobart (wife of Garret Hobart, vice president 1897â€“1899) to refer to herself. Second gentleman of the United States is the title held by Douglas Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris.[1]","image":"Doug_Emhoff_June_2021.jpg.webp"}
