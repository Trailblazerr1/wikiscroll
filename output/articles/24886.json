{"title":"Kintsugi","summary":"Kintsugi (金継ぎ, \"golden joinery\"), also known as kintsukuroi (金繕い, \"golden repair\"),[1] is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum; the method is similar to the maki-e technique.[2][3][4] As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.[5]","image":"Tea_bowl%2C_Korea%2C_Joseon_dynasty%2C_16th_century_AD%2C_Mishima-hakeme_type%2C_buncheong_ware%2C_stoneware_with_white_engobe_and_translucent%2C_greenish-gray_glaze%2C_gold_lacquer_-_Ethnological_Museum%2C_Berlin_-_DSC02061.JPG.webp","url":"Kintsugi"}
