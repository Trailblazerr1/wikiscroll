{"title":"Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)","summary":"Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is the second solo album by English musician Brian Eno, released in November 1974 by Island Records. Unlike his debut album Here Come the Warm Jets, which had featured 16 musicians, this album utilized a core band of five instrumentalists: Eno himself on keyboards and guitar, guitarist Phil Manzanera, bassist Brian Turrington, drummer Freddie Smith, and percussionist Robert Wyatt, and also featured far fewer guests. Manzanera, who had played with Eno in Roxy Music, also participated in the writing and production. To help guide the musicians, Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to facilitate creativity during the recording process.","image":"Tigermountaineno.jpg.webp","url":"Taking_Tiger_Mountain_(By_Strategy)"}
