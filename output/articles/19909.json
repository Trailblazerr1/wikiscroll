{"title":"Hebrew calendar","summary":"The Hebrew calendar (Hebrew: הַלּוּחַ הָעִבְרִי‎, romanized: HaLuah HaIvri), also called Jewish calendar, is a lunisolar calendar used today for Jewish religious observance, and as an official calendar of the state of Israel. It determines the dates for Jewish holidays and the appropriate public reading of Torah portions, yahrzeits (dates to commemorate the death of a relative), and daily Psalm readings, among many ceremonial uses. In Israel, it is used for religious purposes, provides a time frame for agriculture, and is an official calendar for civil holidays, alongside the Gregorian calendar.","image":"Jewish_calendar%2C_showing_Adar_II_between_1927_and_1948.jpeg.webp","url":"Hebrew_calendar"}
