{"title":"Chicken (game)","summary":"The game of chicken, also known as the hawkâ€“dove game or snowdrift game,[1] is a model of conflict for two players in game theory.  The principle of the game is that while the ideal outcome is for one player to yield (to avoid the worst outcome if neither yields), the individuals try to avoid it out of pride for not wanting to look like a 'chicken'. Each player taunts the other to increase the risk of shame in yielding. However, when one player yields, the conflict is avoided, and the game is for the most part over.","image":"Hawk-Dove_transforming_into_Prisoner's_Dilemma.gif"}
