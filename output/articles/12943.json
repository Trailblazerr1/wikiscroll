{"title":"Dietary Reference Intake","summary":"The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) is a system of nutrition recommendations from the National Academy of Medicine (NAM)[lower-alpha 1] of the National Academies (United States).[1]  It was introduced in 1997 in order to broaden the existing guidelines known as Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs, see below).  The DRI values differ from those used in nutrition labeling on food and dietary supplement products in the U.S. and Canada, which uses Reference Daily Intakes (RDIs) and Daily Values (%DV) which were based on outdated RDAs from 1968 but were updated as of 2016.[2]","image":"e3ad05d8aafd72cdf2600caac5cb3f0e5498a076.svg","url":"Dietary_Reference_Intake"}
