{"title":"Black Panther Party","summary":"The Black Panther Party (BPP), originally the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, was a Black Power political organization founded by college students Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton in October 1966 in Oakland, California.[7][8][9] The party was active in the United States between 1966 and 1982, with chapters in many major cities and international chapters in Britain and Algeria.[10][11] Upon its inception the Black Panther Party's core practice was its open carry armed citizens' patrols (\"copwatching\") to monitor the behavior of officers of the Oakland Police Department and challenge police brutality in the city. From 1969 onwards, a variety of community social programs became a core activity.[12] The Party instituted the Free Breakfast for Children Programs to address food injustice, and community health clinics for education and treatment of diseases including  sickle cell anemia, tuberculosis, and later HIV/AIDS.[13][14][15] It advocated for class struggle, with the party representing the proletarian vanguard.[16]","image":"Bpp_logo.PNG.webp"}
