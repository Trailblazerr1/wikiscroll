{"title":"Rohingya genocide","summary":"The Rohingya genocide is a series of ongoing persecutions and killings of the Muslim Rohingya people, perpetrated by the Burmese military. The genocide has consisted of two phases[2][3] to date: the first was a military crackdown that occurred from October 2016 to January 2017, and the second has been occurring since August 2017.[4] The crisis forced over a million Rohingya to flee to other countries. Most fled to Bangladesh, resulting in the creation of the world's largest refugee camp,[3][5][6][7] while others escaped to India, Thailand, Malaysia, and other parts of South and Southeast Asia, where they continue to face persecution.","image":"Aerial_view_of_a_burned_Rohingya_village_in_Rakhine_state%2C_Myanmar_-_September_2017.JPG.webp","url":"Rohingya_genocide"}
