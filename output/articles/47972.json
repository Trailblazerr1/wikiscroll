{"title":"Wartime sexual violence","summary":"Wartime sexual violence is rape or other forms of sexual violence committed by combatants during armed conflict, war, or military occupation often as spoils of war; but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. It is distinguished from sexual harassment, sexual assaults, and rape committed amongst troops in military service.[1][2][3]","image":"2739_-_Firenze_-_Baccio_Bandinelli_-_Rilievo_del_monumento_a_Giovanni_delle_Bande_Nere_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall'Orto%2C_27-Oct-2007.jpg.webp","url":"Wartime_sexual_violence"}
