{"title":"1981 Irish hunger strike","summary":"The 1981 hunger strike was the culmination of a five-year protest during the Troubles by Irish republican prisoners in Northern Ireland. The protest began as the blanket protest in 1976, when the British government withdrew Special Category Status (prisoner of war rather than criminal status) for convicted paramilitary prisoners. In 1978, the dispute escalated into the dirty protest, where prisoners refused to leave their cells to wash and covered the walls of their cells with excrement. In 1980, seven prisoners participated in the first hunger strike, which ended after 53Â days.[1]","image":"25th_commemoration_of_1981_Irish_hunger_strike.JPG.webp","url":"1981_Irish_hunger_strike"}
