{"title":"Ocean thermal energy conversion","summary":"Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) uses the ocean thermal gradient between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface seawaters to run a heat engine and produce useful work, usually in the form of electricity.  OTEC can operate with a very high capacity factor and so can operate in base load mode.","image":"Temperaturunterschiede_Ozeane.png.webp"}
