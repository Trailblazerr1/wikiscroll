{"title":"Castanets","summary":"Castanets, also known as clackers or palillos, are a percussion instrument (idiophone), used in Spanish, Kalo, Moorish,[1] Ottoman, Italian,  Sephardic, Swiss, and Portuguese music. In ancient Greece and ancient Rome there was a similar instrument called crotalum. The instrument consists of a pair of concave shells joined on one edge by a string. They are held in the hand and used to produce clicks for rhythmic accents or a ripping or rattling sound consisting of a rapid series of clicks. They are traditionally made of hardwood (chestnut; Spanish: casta√±o),[1] although fibreglass is becoming increasingly popular.","image":"Castagnetten.jpg.webp","url":"Castanets"}
