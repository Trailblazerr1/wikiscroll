{"title":"Cakewalk","summary":"The cakewalk or cake walk was a dance developed from the \"prize walks\" (dance contests with a cake awarded as the prize) held in the mid-19th century, generally at get-togethers on Black slave plantations before and after emancipation in the Southern United States. Alternative names for the original form of the dance were \"chalkline-walk\", and the \"walk-around\". It was originally a processional partner dance danced with comical formality, and may have developed as a subtle mockery of the mannered dances of white slaveholders.","image":"Cake_walk_1903%2C_10_seconds.gif","url":"Cakewalk"}
