{"title":"Catharsis","summary":"Catharsis (from Greek κάθαρσις, katharsis, meaning \"purification\" or \"cleansing\" or \"clarification\") is the purification and purgation of emotions—particularly pity and fear—through art[1] or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration.[2][3] It is a metaphor originally used by Aristotle in the Poetics, comparing the effects of tragedy on the mind of a spectator to the effect of catharsis on the body.[4][5]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp"}
