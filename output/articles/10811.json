{"title":"Computational complexity theory","summary":"Computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their resource usage, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.","image":"TSP_Deutschland_3.png.webp"}
