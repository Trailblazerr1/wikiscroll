The Senate is modelled after the British House of Lords and consists of 105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister.[1] Seats are assigned on a regional basis: four regions—defined as Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime provinces, and the Western provinces—each receive 24 seats, with the remaining nine seats allocated to the remaining portions of the country: six to Newfoundland and Labrador and one to each of the three northern territories. Senators serve until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 75.","image":"Senate_of_Canada_-_Seating_Plan_(44th_Parliament).svg.png.webp"}
