{"title":"Behaviorism","summary":"Behaviorism is a systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals.[1] It assumes that behavior is either a reflex evoked by the pairing of certain antecedent stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment contingencies, together with the individual's current motivational state and controlling stimuli.  Although behaviorists generally accept the important role of heredity in determining behavior, they focus primarily on environmental events.","image":"Psi2.svg.png.webp"}
