{"title":"Classical conditioning","summary":"Classical conditioning (also known as Pavlovian or respondent conditioning) is a behavioral procedure in which a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus.","image":"Ivan_Pavlov_research_on_dog's_reflex_setup.jpg.webp","url":"Classical_conditioning"}
