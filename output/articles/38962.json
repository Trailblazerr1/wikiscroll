{"title":"Sacred Heart","summary":"The Sacred Heart, also known as the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (Sacratissimum Cor Iesu in Latin), is one of the most widely practised and well-known Catholic devotions, wherein the heart of Jesus is viewed as a symbol of \"God's boundless and passionate love for mankind\".[1] This devotion to Christ is predominantly used in the Catholic Church, followed by high-church Anglicans, Lutherans and some Western Rite Orthodox. In the Latin Church, the liturgical Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is celebrated the third Friday after Pentecost.[2] The 12 promises of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus are also extremely popular.","image":"SacredHeartBatoni.jpg.webp","url":"Sacred_Heart"}
