{"title":"Royal Canadian Mounted Police","summary":"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP; French: Gendarmerie royale du Canada; GRC), often known as the Mounties, are the federal and national police service of Canada, providing law enforcement at the federal level. The RCMP also provide provincial policing in eight of Canada's provinces (all except Ontario and Quebec) and local policing on a contract basis in the three territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon) and more than 150 municipalities, 600 Indigenous communities, and three international airports. The RCMP do not provide active provincial or municipal policing in Ontario or Quebec.[12] However, all members of the RCMP have jurisdiction as a peace officer in all provinces and territories of Canada.[13] Despite the name, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police are no longer an actual mounted police service, with horses only being used at ceremonial events.","image":"Patch_of_the_Royal_Canadian_Mountain_Police.png.webp","url":"Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police"}
