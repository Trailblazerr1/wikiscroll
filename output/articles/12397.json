{"title":"Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution","summary":"The dechristianization of France during the French Revolution is a conventional description of the results of a number of separate policies conducted by various governments of France between the start of the French Revolution in 1789 and the Concordat of 1801, forming the basis of the later and less radical laïcité policies. The aim of the campaign between 1790 and 1794 ranged from the appropriation by the government of the great landed estates and the large amounts of money held by the Gallican Church (the Roman Catholic Church in France) to the termination of Christian religious practice and of the religion itself.[1][2][3] There has been much scholarly debate over whether the movement was popularly motivated.[1]","image":"Pius_VI_–_Collection_generale_des_brefs_et_instructions_relatifs_a_la_revolution_francoise%2C_1798_–_BEIC_14269536.jpg.webp"}
