{"title":"Trialeti culture","summary":"The Trialeti culture, also known as the Trialeti-Vanadzor [Kirovakan] culture, is named after the Trialeti region of Georgia and the city of Vanadzor, Armenia. It is attributed to the late 3rd and early 2nd millennium BC.[1] Trialeti culture emerged in the areas of the preceding Kura-Araxes culture.[2] Some scholars speculate that it was an Indo-European culture.[3][4][5] It developed into the Lchashen-Metsamor culture.[6] It may have also given rise to the Hayasa-Azzi confederation mentioned in Hittite texts,[7] and the Mushki mentioned by the Assyrians.[8]","image":"Gold_goblet_cropped.jpg.webp"}
