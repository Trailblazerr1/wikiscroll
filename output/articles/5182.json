{"title":"Aṅgulimāla","summary":"Aṅgulimāla (Pāli language; lit. 'finger necklace')[1][2] is an important figure in Buddhism, particularly within the Theravāda tradition. Depicted as a ruthless brigand who completely transforms after a conversion to Buddhism, he is seen as the example par excellence of the redemptive power of the Buddha's teaching and the Buddha's skill as a teacher. Aṅgulimāla is seen by Buddhists as the \"patron saint\" of childbirth and is associated with fertility in South and Southeast Asia.","image":"The_Buddha_teaches_Angulimala.jpg.webp","url":"Aṅgulimāla"}
