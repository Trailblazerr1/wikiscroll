{"title":"Genome editing","summary":"Genome editing, or genome engineering, or gene editing, is a type of genetic engineering in which DNA is inserted, deleted, modified or replaced in the genome of a living organism. Unlike early genetic engineering techniques that randomly inserts genetic material into a host genome, genome editing targets the insertions to site specific locations.[1]","image":"MEGANUCLEASE-ZFN-TALEN-CRISPR-text-to-path.svg.png.webp","url":"Genome_editing"}
