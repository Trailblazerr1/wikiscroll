{"title":"Tennis Court Oath","summary":"On 20 June 1789, the members of the French Third Estate took the Tennis Court Oath (French: Serment du Jeu de Paume) in the tennis court which had been built in 1686 for the use of the Versailles palace.[1] The vote was \"not to separate and to reassemble wherever necessary until the Constitution of the kingdom is established\".  It was a pivotal event in the French Revolution. The Estates-General had been called to address the country's fiscal and agricultural crisis, but they had become bogged down in issues of representation immediately after convening in May 1789, particularly whether they would vote by order or by head (which would increase the power of the Third Estate, as they outnumbered the other two estates by a large margin).","image":"Le_Serment_du_Jeu_de_paume.jpg.webp","url":"Tennis_Court_Oath"}
