It is generally structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. It is characterized by spontaneous conversation, and for an effect of immediacy and intimacy as if the host was speaking alone to each of the millions of audience members.[1][2][3] Late-night talk shows are also fundamentally shaped by the personality of the host, which constitutes the \"trademark\" of the show.[1]","image":"President_Barack_Obama_with_David_Letterman_09-21-09.jpg.webp"}
