{"title":"USS California (BB-44)","summary":"USS California (BB-44) was the second of two  Tennessee-class battleships built for the United States Navy between her keel laying in October 1916 and her commissioning in August 1921. The Tennessee class was part of the standard series of twelve battleships built in the 1910s and 1920s, and were developments of the preceding  New Mexico class. They were armed with a battery of twelve 14-inch (356Â mm) guns in four three-gun turrets. California served as the flagship of the Battle Fleet in the Pacific Ocean for duration of her peacetime career. She spent the 1920s and 1930s participating in routine fleet training exercises, including the annual Fleet Problems, and cruises around the Americas and further abroad, such as a goodwill visit to Australia and New Zealand in 1925.","image":"USS_California_(BB-44)_-_NH_61483.jpg.webp","url":"USS_California_(BB-44)"}
