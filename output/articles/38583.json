{"title":"Rover (space exploration)","summary":"A rover (or sometimes planetary rover) is a planetary surface exploration device designed to move across the solid surface on a planet or other planetary mass celestial bodies.  Some rovers have been designed as land vehicles to transport members of a human spaceflight crew; others have been partially or fully autonomous robots.  Rovers are typically created to land on another planet (other than Earth) via a lander-style spacecraft,[1] tasked to collect information about the terrain, and to take crust samples such as dust, soil, rocks, and even liquids.  They are essential tools in space exploration.","image":"PIA15279_3rovers-stand_D2011_1215_D521.jpg.webp","url":"Rover_(space_exploration)"}
