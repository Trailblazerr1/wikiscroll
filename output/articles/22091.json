{"title":"Integrin","summary":"Integrins are transmembrane receptors that facilitate cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion.[3] Upon ligand binding, integrins activate signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular signals such as regulation of the cell cycle, organization of the intracellular cytoskeleton, and movement of new receptors to the cell membrane.[4] The presence of integrins allows rapid and flexible responses to events at the cell surface (e.g. signal platelets to initiate an interaction with coagulation factors).","image":"PDB_1jv2_EBI.jpg.webp","url":"Integrin"}
