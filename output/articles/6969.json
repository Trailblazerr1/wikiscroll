{"title":"Blowfish (cipher)","summary":"Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, designed in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and included in many cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software, and no effective cryptanalysis of it has been found to date. However, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) now receives more attention, and Schneier recommends Twofish for modern applications.[2]","image":"Blowfish_diagram.png.webp","url":"Blowfish_(cipher)"}
