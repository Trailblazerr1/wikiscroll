{"title":"Mosaic (genetics)","summary":"Mosaicism or genetic mosaicism is a condition in multi-cellular organisms in which a single organism possesses more than one genetic line as the result of genetic mutation.[1][2] This means that various genetic lines resulted from a single fertilized egg. Genetic mosaics may often be confused with chimerism, in which two or more genotypes arise in one individual similarly to mosaicism. In chimerism, though, the two genotypes arise from the fusion of more than one fertilized zygote in the early stages of embryonic development, rather than from a mutation or chromosome loss.","image":"Tulip_with_mosaicism.jpg.webp"}
