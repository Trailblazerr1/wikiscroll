{"title":"Street","summary":"A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment. It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about. A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick. Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic.","image":"Typical_Street_In_The_Royal_Borough_Of_Kensington_And_Chelsea_In_London.jpg.webp","url":"Street"}
