{"title":"History of France","summary":"The first written records for the history of France appeared in the Iron Age. What is now France made up the bulk of the region known to the Romans as Gaul. Greek writers noted the presence of three main ethno-linguistic groups in the area: the Gauls, the Aquitani, and the Belgae. The Gauls, the largest and best attested group, were Celtic people speaking what is known as the Gaulish language.","image":"Carte_de_France_dress√©e_pour_l'usage_du_Roy_Delisle_Guillaume_1721.JPEG.webp","url":"A%2fHistory_of_France"}
