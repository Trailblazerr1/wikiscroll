{"title":"Microwave oven","summary":"A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range.[1] This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25–38 mm  (1–1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content food item.","image":"lossy-page1-301px-Consumer_Reports_-_Kenmore_microwave_oven.tif.jpg.webp"}
