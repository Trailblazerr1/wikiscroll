{"title":"Xylene","summary":"Xylene (from Greek ξύλον xylon, \"wood\"),[1][2] xylol or dimethylbenzene is any one of three isomers of dimethylbenzene, or a combination thereof. With the formula (CH3)2C6H4, in each of the three compounds a benzene ring is substituted by two methyl groups. They are all colorless, flammable, slightly greasy liquids.  They are of great industrial value.[3]  The mixture is referred to as both xylene and, more precisely, xylenes.  Mixed xylenes refers to a mixture of the xylenes plus ethylbenzene. The four compounds have identical empirical formulas C8H10. Typically the four compounds are produced together by various catalytic reforming and pyrolysis methods.[4]","image":"IUPAC-cyclic.svg.png.webp"}
