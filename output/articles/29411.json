{"title":"Merkle tree","summary":"In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or Merkle tree is a tree in which every \"leaf\" (node) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. A hash tree allows efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure. A hash tree is a generalization of a hash list and a hash chain.","image":"Hash_Tree.svg.png.webp","url":"Merkle_tree"}
