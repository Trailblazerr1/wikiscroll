{"title":"SMS Pommern","summary":"SMS Pommern[lower-alpha 1] was one of five  Deutschland-class pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Kaiserliche Marine between 1904 and 1906. Named after the Prussian province of Pomerania, she was built at the AG Vulcan yard at Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), where she was laid down on 22 March 1904 and launched on 2 December 1905. She was commissioned into the navy on 6 August 1907. The ship was armed with a battery of four 28 cm (11 in) guns and had a top speed of 18 knots (33 km/h; 21 mph). The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered the service, being inferior in size, armor, firepower, and speed to the revolutionary new battleship HMS Dreadnought.","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-61-21%2C_Linienschiff_\"SMS_Pommern\".jpg.webp","url":"SMS_Pommern"}
