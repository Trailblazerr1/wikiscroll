{"title":"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident","summary":"The Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident took place in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, on the eve of Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. There is controversy over the incident; Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong, a new religious movement that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, and claimed that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide.[1][2] Several journalists have suggested the self-immolations were staged.[3][4][5]","image":"April25Zhognanhai.jpg.webp"}
