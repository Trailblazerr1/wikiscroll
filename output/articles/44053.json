{"title":"The Cup of Life","summary":"\"The Cup of Life\" (Spanish: \"La Copa de la Vida\") is a song recorded by Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin for his fourth studio album, Vuelve (1998). Martin created the song after FIFA requested him an anthem. The song was written by Luis GÃ³mez Escolar, Desmond Child, and Draco Rosa, while the production was handled by the latter two. It was released by Columbia Records on March 9, 1998, as the second single from the album, and became the official song of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. A primarily Spanish language samba-rooted Latin pop song, it carries a soccer-heavy message with fully positive lyrics.","image":"The_Cup_of_Life_cover.png.webp","url":"The_Cup_of_Life"}
