{"title":"H II region","summary":"An H II region or HII region is a region of interstellar atomic hydrogen that is ionized.[1] It is typically a cloud in a molecular cloud of partially ionized gas in which star formation has recently taken place, with a size ranging from one to hundreds of light years, and density from a few to about a million particles per cubic cm. The Orion Nebula, now known to be an H II region, was observed in 1610 by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc by telescope, the first such object discovered.","image":"Nursery_of_New_Stars_-_GPN-2000-000972.jpg.webp","url":"H_II_region"}
