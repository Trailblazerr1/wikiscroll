{"title":"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences","summary":"\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\" (Russian: «О культе личности и его последствиях», «O kul'te lichnosti i yego posledstviyakh»),  popularly known as the \"Secret Speech\" (Russian: секретный доклад, sekretnïy doklad), was a report by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, made to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on 25 February 1956. Khrushchev's speech was sharply critical of the rule of the deceased General Secretary and Premier Joseph Stalin, particularly with respect to the purges which had especially marked the last years of the 1930s. Khrushchev charged Stalin with having fostered a leadership cult of personality despite ostensibly maintaining support for the ideals of communism. The speech was leaked to the West by the Israeli intelligence agency Shin Bet, which received it from the Polish-Jewish journalist Wiktor Grajewski.","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1956–1991).svg.png.webp","url":"On_the_Cult_of_Personality_and_Its_Consequences"}
