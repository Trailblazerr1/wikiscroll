{"title":"Galerina marginata","summary":"Galerina marginata, known colloquially as the funeral bell or the deadly skullcap, is a species of poisonous fungus in the family Hymenogastraceae of the order Agaricales. Prior to 2001, the species G. autumnalis, G. oregonensis, G. unicolor, and G. venenata were thought to be separate due to differences in habitat and the viscidity of their caps, but phylogenetic analysis showed that they are all the same species.","image":"Galerina_marginata_Point_Reyes.jpg.webp","url":"Galerina_marginata"}
