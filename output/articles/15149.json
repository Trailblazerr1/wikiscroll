{"title":"Eskom","summary":"Eskom is a South African electricity public utility. It was established in 1923 as the Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM) and also known by its Afrikaans name Elektrisiteitsvoorsieningskommissie (EVKOM), by the South African government and people of the Republic of South Africa in terms of the Electricity Act (1922). South Africa became a republic in the 1960s. Eskom represents South Africa in the Southern African Power Pool. The utility is the largest producer of electricity in Africa,[2][3] and was among the top utilities in the world in terms of generation capacity and sales, but has since slipped in both categories.  It is the largest of South Africa's state owned enterprises.  Eskom operates a number of notable power stations, including Matimba Power Station and Medupi Power Station in Lephalale, Kusile Power Station in Witbank, Kendal Power Station, and Koeberg nuclear power station in the Western Cape Province, the only nuclear power plant in Africa.","image":"Eskom_(logo).svg.png.webp"}
