{"title":"Dexter's Laboratory","summary":"Dexter's Laboratory (commonly abbreviated as Dexter's Lab) is an American animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network. It follows Dexter, a boy-genius and inventor with a hidden laboratory in his room, which he keeps secret from his parents. He is at constant odds with his older sister Dee Dee, who always gains access to Dexter's lab and inadvertently foils his experiments. Dexter has a bitter rivalry with Mandark, a fellow boy-genius who is his neighbor and classmate. The segments featured superhero-based characters—Monkey, Dexter's pet lab-monkey/superhero, and the Justice Friends, a trio of superheroes who share an apartment—and are prominently featured only in the first two seasons.","image":"Dexter-logo.png.webp","url":"Dexter's_Laboratory"}
