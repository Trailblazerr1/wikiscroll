{"title":"Experimental theatre","summary":"Experimental theatre (also known as avant-garde theatre) began in Western theatre in the late 19th century with Alfred Jarry and his Ubu plays as a rejection of both the age in particular and, in general, the dominant ways of writing and producing plays. The term has shifted over time as the mainstream theatre world has adopted many forms that were once considered radical.","image":"Robinwhitewhorecrosshalf.jpg.webp","url":"Experimental_theatre"}
