{"title":"Rostra","summary":"The rostra (Italian: Rostri) was a large platform built in the city of Rome that stood during the republican and imperial periods.[1] Speakers would stand on the rostra and face the north side of the comitium towards the senate house and deliver orations to those assembled in between. It is often referred to as a suggestus or tribunal,[2] the first form of which dates back to the Roman Kingdom, the Vulcanal.[3][4]","image":"Munt_Marcus_Lollius_Palicanus.jpg.webp"}
