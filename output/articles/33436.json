{"title":"Ottoman Turkish","summary":"Ottoman Turkish (Ottoman Turkish: لِسانِ عُثمانى‎, lisân-ı Osmânî, Turkish pronunciation: [li'saːnɯ os'maːniː]; Turkish: Osmanlı Türkçesi) was the standardized register of the Turkish language used in the Ottoman Empire (14th to 20th centuries CE). It borrowed extensively, in all aspects, from Arabic and Persian, and its speakers used the Ottoman Turkish alphabet for written communication. During the peak of Ottoman power (c. 16th century CE), words of foreign origin in Turkish literature in the Ottoman Empire heavily outnumbered native Turkish words,[3] with Arabic and Persian vocabulary accounting for up to 88% of the Ottoman vocabulary in some texts.[4]","image":"Ottoman_Turkish_in_Nastaliq.png.webp"}
