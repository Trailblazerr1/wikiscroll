{"title":"Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race","summary":"The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race is an annual long-distance sled dog race run in early March from Anchorage to Nome, entirely within the US state of Alaska. Mushers and a team of 14 dogs,[1] of which at least 5[2] must be on the towline at the finish line, cover the distance in 8â€“15 days or more.[1] The Iditarod began in 1973 as an event to test the best sled dog mushers and teams but evolved into today's highly competitive race.","image":"Iditarod_start_line_2020_(Quintin_Soloviev).jpg.webp","url":"Iditarod_Trail_Sled_Dog_Race"}
