{"title":"Drama (film and television)","summary":"In film and television, drama is a category of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone.[1] Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre,[2] such as soap opera (operatic drama), police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama, and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods.","image":"Gone_With_The_Wind_1967_re-release.jpg.webp"}
