{"title":"Biman Bangladesh Airlines","summary":"Biman Bangladesh Airlines (Bengali: বিমান বাংলাদেশ এয়ারলাইন্স),[nb 1] commonly known as Biman (Bengali: বিমান), pronounced /biːmɑːn/ (bee-mah-n), is the national flag carrier of Bangladesh.[5] With its main hub at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka, the airline also operates flights from its secondary hubs at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong and as well as Osmani International Airport in Sylhet. The airline provides international passenger and cargo services to multiple destinations and has air service agreements in 42 countries.[6] The headquarters of the airline, Balaka Bhaban, is located in Kurmitola, in the northern part of Dhaka. Annual Hajj flights; transporting tourists, migrants and non-resident Bangladeshi workers; and the activities of its subsidiaries form an integral part of the corporate business of the airline. Bangladesh's air transport sector, which is experiencing an 8% annual growth rate thanks to a large number of outbound tourists, domestic tourists and non-resident Bangladeshi travellers, is very competitive with stiff competition among a number of private Bangladeshi airlines as well as Biman.[7]: 11","image":"Biman_Airlines_classic_logo.svg.png.webp"}
