{"title":"Pregnancy test","summary":"A pregnancy test is used to determine whether a person is pregnant. The two primary methods are: 1) testing for human pregnancy hormone (human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)) in blood or urine and 2) ultrasonography.[1] Testing blood for hCG results in the earliest detection of pregnancy.[2] Almost all pregnant women will have a positive urine pregnancy test one week after the first day of a missed menstrual period.[3]","image":"Urine_pregnancy_test_(positive).png.webp","url":"Pregnancy_test"}
