{"title":"Scottsboro Boys","summary":"The Scottsboro Boys were nine African-American teenagers, ages 12 to 19, accused in Alabama of raping two white women in 1931.  The landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with racism and the right to a fair trial. The cases included a lynch mob before the suspects had been indicted, all-white juries, rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. It is commonly cited as an example of a miscarriage of justice in the United States legal system.","image":"Leibowitz%2C_Samuel_%26_Scottsboro_Boys_1932.jpg.webp"}
