{"title":"Bipartite graph","summary":"In the mathematical field of graph theory, a bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets \n  \n    \n      \n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n such that every edge connects a vertex in \n  \n    \n      \n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U}\n  \n to one in \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n. Vertex sets \n  \n    \n      \n        U\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle U}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V}\n  \n are usually called the parts of the graph. Equivalently, a bipartite graph is a graph that does not contain any odd-length cycles.[1][2]","image":"458a728f53b9a0274f059cd695e067c430956025.svg"}
