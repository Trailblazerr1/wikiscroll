{"title":"Natural killer cell","summary":"Natural killer cells, also known as NK cells or large granular lymphocytes (LGL), are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system that belong to the rapidly expanding family of innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and represent 5â€“20% of all circulating lymphocytes in humans.[1] The role of NK cells is analogous to that of cytotoxic T cells in the vertebrate adaptive immune response. NK cells provide rapid responses to virus-infected cell and other intracellular pathogens acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation.  Typically, immune cells detect the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering cytokine release, causing the death of the infected cell by lysis or apoptosis. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize and kill stressed cells in the absence of antibodies and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction.  They were named \"natural killers\" because of the notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing \"self\" markers of MHC class 1.[2] This role is especially important because harmful cells that are missing MHC I markers cannot be detected and destroyed by other immune cells, such as T lymphocyte cells.","image":"Human_Natural_Killer_Cell_(29120480442).jpg.webp","url":"Natural_killer_cell"}
