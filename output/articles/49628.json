{"title":"Ājīvika","summary":"Ajivika (IAST: Ājīvika) is one of the nāstika or \"heterodox\" schools of Indian philosophy.[7][8] Believed to be founded in the 5th century BCE by Makkhali Gosala, it was a śramaṇa movement and a major rival of Vedic religion, early Buddhism and Jainism.[9] Ājīvikas were organised renunciates who formed discrete communities.[10] The precise identity of the Ajivikas is not well known, and it is even unclear if they were a divergent sect of the Buddhists or the Jains.[11]","image":"Ajivika_Monk_in_a_Gandhara_sculpture_of_the_Mahaparinirvana.jpg.webp"}
