{"title":"Museum Island","summary":"The Museum Island (German: Museumsinsel) is a museum complex on the northern part of the Spree Island in the historic heart of Berlin. It is one of the most visited sights of Germany's capital and one of the most important museum sites in Europe. Built from 1830 to 1930 by order of the Prussian Kings according to plans by five architects, the Museum Island was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. It consists of the Altes Museum, the Neues Museum, the Alte Nationalgalerie, the Bode-Museum and the Pergamonmuseum.[1] As Museum Island includes all of Spree Island north of the Unter den Linden, the Berliner Dom is also located here, near the Lustgarten. To the south, the reconstructed Berlin Palace houses the Humboldt Forum museum and opened in 2020. Since the German reunification, the Museum Island has been rebuilt and extended according to a master plan.[2] In 2019, a new visitor center and art gallery, the James Simon Gallery, was opened.","image":"Berlin_Museumsinsel_Fernsehturm.jpg.webp","url":"Museum_Island"}
