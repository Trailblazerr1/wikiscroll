{"title":"Single-photon emission computed tomography","summary":"Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT, or less commonly, SPET) is a nuclear medicine tomographic imaging technique using gamma rays.[1] It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a gamma camera (that is, scintigraphy),[2] but is able to provide true 3D information. This information is typically presented as cross-sectional slices through the patient, but can be freely reformatted or manipulated as required.","image":"SPECT_Slice_of_Brain_using_Tc-99m_Ceretec.jpg.webp","url":"Single-photon_emission_computed_tomography"}
