{"title":"IPv4 address exhaustion","summary":"IPv4 address exhaustion is the depletion of the pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses. Because the original Internet architecture had fewer than 4.3 billion addresses available, depletion has been anticipated since the late 1980s, when the Internet started experiencing dramatic growth. This depletion is one of the reasons for the development and deployment of its successor protocol, IPv6. IPv4 and IPv6 coexist on the Internet.","image":"IPv4_exhaustion_time_line-en.svg.png.webp","url":"IPv4_address_exhaustion"}
