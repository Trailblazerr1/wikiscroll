{"title":"Diabetic nephropathy","summary":"Diabetic nephropathy, also known as diabetic kidney disease,[5] is the chronic loss of kidney function occurring in those with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic nephropathy is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) globally. Protein loss in the urine due to damage to the glomeruli may become massive, and cause a low serum albumin with resulting generalized body swelling (edema) and result in the nephrotic syndrome. Likewise, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) may progressively fall from a normal of over 90 ml/min/1.73m2 to less than 15, at which point the patient is said to have end-stage renal disease.[6] It usually is slowly progressive over years.[7]","image":"Nodular_glomerulosclerosis.jpeg.webp","url":"Diabetic_nephropathy"}
