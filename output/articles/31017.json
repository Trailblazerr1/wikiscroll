{"title":"Myelin","summary":"Myelin is a lipid-rich (fatty) substance that surrounds nerve cell axons (the nervous system's \"wires\") to insulate them and increase the rate at which electrical impulses (called action potentials) are passed along the axon.[1] The myelinated axon can be likened to an electrical wire (the axon) with insulating material (myelin) around it. However, unlike the plastic covering on an electrical wire, myelin does not form a single long sheath over the entire length of the axon. Rather, myelin sheaths the nerve in segments: in general, each axon is encased with multiple long myelinated sections with short gaps in between called nodes of Ranvier.","image":"Neuron.svg.png.webp","url":"Myelin"}
