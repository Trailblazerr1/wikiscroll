{"title":"Wavenumber","summary":"In the physical sciences, the wavenumber (also wave number or repetency[1]) is the spatial frequency of a wave, measured in cycles per unit distance or radians per unit distance. Whereas temporal frequency can be thought of as the number of waves per unit time, wavenumber is the number of waves per unit distance.","image":"Commutative_diagram_of_harmonic_wave_properties.svg.png.webp"}
