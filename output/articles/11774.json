{"title":"Cyanobacteria","summary":"Cyanobacteria /saɪˌænoʊbækˈtɪəriə/, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria[4] that obtain energy via photosynthesis. The name cyanobacteria comes from their color (Greek: κυανός, romanized: kyanós, lit. 'blue'),[5][6] giving them their other name, \"blue-green algae\",[7][8] though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes.[9] They appear to have originated in freshwater or a terrestrial environment.[10] Sericytochromatia, the proposed name of the paraphyletic and most basal group, is the ancestor of both the non-photosynthetic group Melainabacteria and the  photosynthetic cyanobacteria, also called Oxyphotobacteria.[11]","image":"CSIRO_ScienceImage_4203_A_bluegreen_algae_species_Cylindrospermum_sp_under_magnification.jpg.webp","url":"Cyanobacteria"}
