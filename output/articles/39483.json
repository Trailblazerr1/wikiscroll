{"title":"Saturn I","summary":"The Saturn I (pronounced \"Saturn 1\") was a rocket designed as the United States' first medium lift launch vehicle for up to 20,000-pound (9,100Â kg) low Earth orbit payloads.[2] The rocket's first stage was built as a cluster of propellant tanks engineered from older rocket tank designs, leading critics to jokingly refer to it as \"Cluster's Last Stand\". Its development was taken over from the Advanced Research Projects Agency in 1958 by the newly-formed civilian NASA. Its design proved sound and flexible. It was successful in initiating the development of liquid hydrogen-fueled rocket propulsion, launching the Pegasus satellites, and flight verification of the Apollo command and service module launch phase aerodynamics. Ten Saturn I rockets were flown before it was replaced by the heavy lift derivative Saturn IB, which used a larger, higher total impulse second stage and an improved guidance and control system. It also led the way to development of the super-heavy lift Saturn V which carried the first men to landings on the Moon in the Apollo program.","image":"SA-1_launch.jpg.webp"}
