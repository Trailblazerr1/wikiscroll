{"title":"Toronto Raptors draft history","summary":"The Toronto Raptors have made 34 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft selections during their draft history. The Raptors began as an expansion team in 1995 and first participated in the NBA draft on June 28, 1995 at SkyDome, now known as Rogers Centre, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] In 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time.[2] Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season.[2] Teams can also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have more or less than two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.[3]","image":"Andrea_Bargnani.JPG.webp","url":"Toronto_Raptors_draft_history"}
