{"title":"Songtsen Gampo","summary":"Songtsen Gampo[1] (Tibetan: སྲོང་བཙན་སྒམ་པོ, Wylie: srong btsan sgam po; 569–649? 650), also Songzan Ganbu (Chinese: 松贊干布; pinyin: Sōngzàn Gānbù), was the 33rd Tibetan king and founder of the Tibetan Empire,[lower-alpha 1] and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali consort Bhrikuti, of Nepal's Licchavi dynasty, as well as with the unification of what had previously been several Tibetan kingdoms.[2] He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of the Tibetan script and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet.","image":"Songstengampo.jpg.webp"}
