{"title":"Ernest Renan","summary":"Joseph Ernest Renan (French: [ʁənɑ̃]; 27 February 1823 – 2 October 1892)[2] was a French Orientalist and Semitic scholar, expert of Semitic languages and civilizations, historian of religion, philologist, philosopher, biblical scholar and critic.[3] He wrote influential and pioneering historical works on the origins of early Christianity,[3] and espoused popular political theories especially concerning nationalism and national identity. Renan is credited as being among the first scholars to advance the now-discredited[4] Khazar theory, which held that Ashkenazi Jews were descendants of the Khazars,[5] Turkic peoples who had adopted Jewish religion and migrated to Western Europe following the collapse of their khanate.[5]","image":"Ernest_Renan_1876-84.jpg.webp","url":"Ernest_Renan"}
