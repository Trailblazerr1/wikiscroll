{"title":"Preston By-pass","summary":"The Preston Bypass was the United Kingdom’s first motorway.  It was designed and engineered by Lancashire County Council surveyor James Drake as part of a larger initiative to create a north-south motorway network that would later form part of the M6 motorway. The bypass was opened on 5 December 1958 by the then Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan.  Nearly £3 million was spent in its construction. The original 8+1⁄4-mile (13.3 km) motorway ran around the east side of Preston between Bamber Bridge (now the M6, Junction 29) and Broughton (now the M55, Junction 1) and crosses over the River Ribble at Samlesbury at the M6 Junction 31.","image":"Preston_by-pass_modern_map.png.webp","url":"Preston_By-pass"}
