{"title":"Ciabatta","summary":"Ciabatta (/tʃəˈbɑːtə, -ˈbæt-/, Italian: [tʃaˈbatta]; literally \"slipper\")[1] is an Italian white bread made from wheat flour, water, salt, yeast and olive oil, created in 1982 [2][3] by a baker in Adria, province of Rovigo, Veneto, Italy, in response to the popularity of French baguettes.[2][3] Ciabatta is somewhat elongated, broad, and flat, and is baked in many variations, although unique for its alveolar holes. Ciabatta is made with a strong flour and uses a much wetter dough than traditional French bread.[4][3][2]","image":"Ciabatta_cut.JPG.webp","url":"Ciabatta"}
