{"title":"Rings of Saturn","summary":"The rings of Saturn are the most extensive ring system of any planet in the Solar System. They consist of countless small particles, ranging in size from micrometers to meters,[1] that orbit around Saturn. The ring particles are made almost entirely of water ice, with a trace component of rocky material. There is still no consensus as to their mechanism of formation. Although theoretical models indicated that the rings were likely to have formed early in the Solar System's history,[2] newer data from Cassini suggested they formed relatively late.[3]","image":"PIA17172_Saturn_eclipse_mosaic_bright_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Rings_of_Saturn"}
