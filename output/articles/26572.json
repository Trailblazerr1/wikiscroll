There have been 29  Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities, and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina (winter) in 1944.
