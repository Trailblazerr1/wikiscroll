{"title":"La Amistad","summary":"La Amistad (pronounced [la a.misˈtað]; Spanish for Friendship) was a 19th-century two-masted schooner, owned by a Spaniard colonizing Cuba. It became renowned in July 1839 for a slave revolt by Mende captives, who had been captured and sold to European slave traders and illegally transported by a Portuguese ship from West Africa to Cuba in violation of existing European treaties against the Atlantic slave trade. Two Spanish plantation owners, Don José Ruiz and Don Pedro Montes, bought 53 captives, including four children, in Havana, Cuba and were transporting them on the ship to their plantations near Puerto Príncipe (modern Camagüey, Cuba).[1] The revolt began after the schooner's cook jokingly told the slaves that they were to be \"killed, salted, and cooked\". Sengbe Pieh, a Mende man, also known as Joseph Cinqué, unshackled himself and the others on the third day and started the revolt.[2] They took control of the ship, killing the captain and the cook. In the melee, three Africans were also killed.","image":"La_Amistad_(ship)_restored.jpg.webp","url":"La_Amistad"}
