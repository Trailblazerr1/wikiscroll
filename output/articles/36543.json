{"title":"Purchasing power parity","summary":"Purchasing power parity (PPP)[1] is the measurement of prices in different countries that uses the prices of specific goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of the countries' currencies. In many cases PPP produces an inflation rate that is equal to the price of the basket of goods at one location divided by the price of the basket of goods at a different location. The PPP inflation and exchange rate may differ from the market exchange rate because of poverty, tariffs, and other transaction costs.","image":"0cb4b0e768eaf1b77b3c14a7bc5046f8c100b461.svg"}
