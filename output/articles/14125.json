{"title":"Economy of England in the Middle Ages","summary":"The medieval English saw their economy as comprising three groups â€“ the clergy, who prayed; the knights, who fought; and the peasants, who worked the landtowns involved in international trade.[1] Over the next five centuries the economy would at first grow and then suffer an acute crisis, resulting in significant political and economic change. Despite economic dislocation in urban and extraction economies, including shifts in the holders of wealth and the location of these economies, the economic output of towns and mines developed and intensified over the period.[2] By the end of the period, England had a weak government, by later standards, overseeing an economy dominated by rented farms controlled by gentry, and a thriving community of indigenous English merchants and corporations.[3]","image":"Cleric-Knight-Workman.jpg.webp","url":"Economy_of_England_in_the_Middle_Ages"}
