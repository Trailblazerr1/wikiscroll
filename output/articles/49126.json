{"title":"Yahweh","summary":"Yahweh[lower-alpha 1] was the national god of ancient Israel and Judah.[3] His origins reach at least to the early Iron Age, and likely to the Late Bronze Age.[4] In the oldest biblical literature, he is a storm-and-warrior deity[5] who leads the heavenly army against Israel's enemies;[6] at that time the Israelites worshipped him alongside a variety of Canaanite gods and goddesses, including El, Asherah and Baal;[7] in later centuries, El and Yahweh became conflated and El-linked epithets such as El Shaddai came to be applied to Yahweh alone,[8] and other gods and goddesses such as Baal and Asherah were absorbed into the Yahwist religion.[9]","image":"Zeus_Yahweh.jpg.webp"}
