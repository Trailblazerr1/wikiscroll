{"title":"Stevens–Johnson syndrome","summary":"Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a type of severe skin reaction.[1] Together with toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens–Johnson/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), it forms a spectrum of disease, with SJS being less severe.[1][3] Erythema multiforme (EM) is generally considered a separate condition.[5] Early symptoms of SJS include fever and flu-like symptoms.[1] A few days later, the skin begins to blister and peel, forming painful raw areas.[1] Mucous membranes, such as the mouth, are also typically involved.[1] Complications include dehydration, sepsis, pneumonia and multiple organ failure.[1]","image":"Stevens-johnson-syndrome.jpg.webp"}
