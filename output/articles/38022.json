{"title":"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia","summary":"\"Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia\" (or \"Voices of Rhodesia\") was the national anthem of Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in April 1980) between 1974 and 1979. The tune was that of \"Ode to Joy\", the Fourth Movement from Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which had been adopted as the official European continental anthem by the Council of Europe in 1972 (it remains the European Union's anthem today). The music used in Rhodesia was an original sixteen-bar arrangement by Captain Ken MacDonald, the bandmaster of the Rhodesian African Rifles. A national competition was organised by the government to find an appropriate set of lyrics to match the chosen tune, and won by Mary Bloom of Gwelo.","image":"Flag_of_Rhodesia_(1968â€“1979).svg.png.webp"}
