It was the first Olympic Games to take place in twelve years, due to the Second World War (and was known informally as \"The Austerity Games\" - largely due to countries having to bring their own food due to shortages in Britain), with London being chosen as the host city in May 1946.","image":"Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png.webp","url":"1948_Summer_Olympics_medal_table"}
