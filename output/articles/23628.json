{"title":"John Chrysostom","summary":"John Chrysostom (/ˈkrɪsəstəm, krɪˈsɒstəm/; Greek: Ἰωάννης ὁ Χρυσόστομος; c. 347 – 14 September 407)[6] was an important Early Church Father who served as archbishop of Constantinople. He is known for his  preaching and public speaking, his denunciation of abuse of authority[7] by both ecclesiastical and political leaders, Divine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom, and his ascetic sensibilities. The epithet Χρυσόστομος (Chrysostomos, anglicized as Chrysostom) means \"golden-mouthed\" in Greek and denotes his celebrated eloquence.[2][8] Chrysostom was among the most prolific authors in the early Christian Church, although both Origen of Alexandria[9] and Augustine of Hippo[10] exceeded Chrysostom.","image":"Johnchrysostom.jpg.webp"}
