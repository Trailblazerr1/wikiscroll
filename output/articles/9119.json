{"title":"Centuriate Assembly","summary":"The Centuriate Assembly (Latin: comitia centuriata) of the Roman Republic was one of the three voting assemblies in the Roman constitution. It was named the Centuriate Assembly as it originally divided Roman citizens into groups of one hundred men by classes. The centuries initially reflected military status, but were later based on the wealth of their members. The centuries gathered into the Centuriate Assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The majority of votes in any century decided how that century voted. Each century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Century held. Once a majority of centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.[1] Only the Centuriate Assembly could declare war or elect the highest-ranking Roman magistrates: consuls, praetors and censors.[2] The Centuriate Assembly could also pass a law that granted constitutional command authority, or \"Imperium\", to Consuls and Praetors (the lex de imperio or \"Law on Imperium\"), and Censorial powers to Censors (the lex de potestate censoria or \"Law on Censorial Powers\").[2] In addition, the Centuriate Assembly served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases (in particular, cases involving perduellio), and ratified the results of a Census.[3]","image":"Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png.webp"}
