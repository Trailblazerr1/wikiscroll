{"title":"Group (periodic table)","summary":"In chemistry, a group (also known as a family[1]) is a column of elements in the periodic table of the chemical elements. There are 18 numbered groups in the periodic table; the f-block columns (between groups 2 and 3) are not numbered. The elements in a group have similar physical or chemical characteristics of the outermost electron shells of their atoms (i.e., the same core charge), because most chemical properties are dominated by the orbital location of the outermost electron.","image":"Simple_Periodic_Table_Chart-blocks.svg.png.webp","url":"Group_(periodic_table)"}
