{"title":"Phase (waves)","summary":"In physics and mathematics, the phase of a periodic function F {\\displaystyle F} of some real variable t {\\displaystyle t} (such as time) is an angle-like quantity representing the fraction of the cycle covered up to t {\\displaystyle t} .  It is denoted ϕ ( t ) {\\displaystyle \\phi (t)} and expressed in such a scale that it varies by one full turn as the variable t {\\displaystyle t} goes through each period (and F ( t ) {\\displaystyle F(t)} goes through each complete cycle).  It may be measured in any angular unit such as degrees or radians, thus increasing by 360° or 2 π {\\displaystyle 2\\pi } as the variable t {\\displaystyle t} completes a full period.[1]","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Phase_(waves)"}
