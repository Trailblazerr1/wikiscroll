{"title":"True at First Light","summary":"True at First Light is a book by American novelist Ernest Hemingway about his 1953â€“54 East African safari with his fourth wife Mary, released posthumously in his centennial year in 1999. The book received mostly negative or lukewarm reviews from the popular press and sparked a literary controversy regarding how, and whether,  an author's work should be reworked and published after his death. Unlike critics in the popular press, Hemingway scholars generally consider True at First Light to be complex and a worthy addition to his canon of later fiction.","image":"TrueAtFirstLight.jpg.webp"}
