{"title":"Drought","summary":"A drought is an event of prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric (below-average precipitation), surface water or ground water. A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days.[1] It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region[2] and harm to the local economy.[3]  Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires.  Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.","image":"Drought.jpg.webp"}
