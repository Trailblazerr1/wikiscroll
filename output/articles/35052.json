{"title":"Pioneer 11","summary":"Pioneer 11 (also known as Pioneer G) is a 260-kilogram (570Â lb) robotic space probe launched by NASA on April 5, 1973, to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter and Saturn, solar winds, and cosmic rays.[1] It was the first probe to encounter Saturn, the second to fly through the asteroid belt, and the second to fly by Jupiter. Later, Pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve an escape velocity allowing it to leave the Solar System. Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe, the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30, 1995, and the last good engineering data was received on November 24, 1995.[2][3]","image":"An_artist's_impression_of_a_Pioneer_spacecraft_on_its_way_to_interstellar_space.jpg.webp","url":"Pioneer_11"}
