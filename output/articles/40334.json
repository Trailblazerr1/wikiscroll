Its telling of how Adora discovers her identity deviates from its original He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword predecessor and source material, in which the Sorceress of Grayskull sent Adam/ He-Man to find his twin sister, Adora, resulting in the discovery of her She-Ra identity.","image":"She-Ra_and_The_Princesses_of_Power_Logo.png.webp"}
