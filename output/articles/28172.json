{"title":"Male gaze","summary":"In feminist theory, the male gaze is the act of depicting women and the world, in the visual arts[2] and in literature,[3] from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer.[4] In the visual and the aesthetic representations of narrative cinema, the male gaze has three perspectives: the men behind the camera, the male characters in the filmed story, and the male spectators of the work.[5][6] Moreover, the female gaze is the conceptual analogue of the male gaze.[7][8]","image":"FÃ©lix_Trutat_-_Nude_Girl_on_a_Panther_Skin_-_WGA23101.jpg.webp"}
