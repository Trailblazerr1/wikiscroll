{"title":"The Tonight Show","summary":"The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show that has aired on NBC since 1954. The show has been hosted by six comedians: Steve Allen (1954–1957), Jack Paar (1957–1962), Johnny Carson (1962–1992), Jay Leno (1992–2009, 2010–2014), Conan O'Brien (2009–2010), and Jimmy Fallon (2014–present).  Besides the main hosts, a number of regular \"guest hosts\" have been used, notably Ernie Kovacs, who hosted two nights per week during 1956–1957, and a number of guests used by Carson, who curtailed his own hosting duties back to three nights per week by the 1980s.  Among Carson's regular guest hosts were Joey Bishop, David Letterman, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, and Jay Leno. The Tonight Show is the world's longest-running talk show and the longest-running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows Today and Meet the Press.  The current incarnation is taped from Studio 6B at NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center in New York, the same studio used during the Jack Paar era.  During its initial run under Steve Allen, it originated from the Hudson Theatre on Broadway.  From 1973 to 2009, and from 2010 to 2014 the show was taped at one of three different studios at NBC's Burbank, California Studios.  During Conan O'Brien's tenure, the show was taped at Stage 1 of Universal Studios Hollywood.","image":"Tonight_Show_Starring_Jimmy_Fallon_Intertitle.png.webp","url":"The_Tonight_Show"}
