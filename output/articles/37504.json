{"title":"Regions of Brazil","summary":"Brazil is geopolitically divided into five regions (also called macroregions) by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Portuguese: Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica, IBGE); each region is composed of three or more states. Although officially recognized, the division is merely academic, considering geographic, social and economic factors, among others, and has no political effects other than orientating Federal-level government programs. Under the state level, there are also mesoregions and microregions.[1]","image":"Brazil_Labelled_Map.svg.png.webp"}
