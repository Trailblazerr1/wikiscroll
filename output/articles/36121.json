{"title":"Prison","summary":"A prison,[lower-alpha 1] also known as a jail[lower-alpha 2] or gaol (dated,[lower-alpha 3] standard English, Australian, and historically in Canada), penitentiary (American English and Canadian English), detention center (or detention centre outside the US),[lower-alpha 4] correction center, correctional facility,  lock-up[lower-alpha 5] or remand center, is a facility in which inmates (or prisoners) are confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as punishment for various crimes. Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment. In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed.","image":"Pentonvilleiso19.jpg.webp"}
