{"title":"Nazi book burnings","summary":"The Nazi book burnings were a campaign conducted by the German Student Union (German: Deutsche Studentenschaft, DSt) to ceremonially burn books in Nazi Germany and Austria in the 1930s. The books targeted for burning were those viewed as being subversive or as representing ideologies opposed to Nazism. These included books written by Jewish, communist, socialist, anarchist, liberal, pacifist, and sexologist authors among others.[1] The initial books burned were those of Karl Marx and Karl Kautsky,[2] but came to include vast numbers of authors, including Albert Einstein, Helen Keller, writers in French and English, and effectively any book that was not vibrant in its support of Nazism.","image":"1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG.webp","url":"Nazi_book_burnings"}
