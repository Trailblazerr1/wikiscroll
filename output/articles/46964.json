{"title":"Uterine fibroid","summary":"Uterine fibroids, also known as uterine leiomyomas or fibroids, are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus.[1] Most women have no symptoms while others may have painful or heavy periods.[1] If large enough, they may push on the bladder  causing a frequent need to urinate.[1] They may also cause pain during sex or lower back pain.[1][3] A woman can have one uterine fibroid or many.[1] Occasionally, fibroids may make it difficult to become pregnant, although this is uncommon.[1]","image":"Uterine_fibroids.jpg.webp"}
