{"title":"In Utero","summary":"In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 13, 1993, by DGC Records. Nirvana intended to depart from the more polished sound of their previous album, Nevermind (1991), with a greater range of sounds and moods. To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, they hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero over two weeks in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. The lyrics and album packaging incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and Nirvana's newfound fame.","image":"In_Utero_(Nirvana)_album_cover.jpg.webp"}
