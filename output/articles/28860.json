{"title":"Mastodon","summary":"A mastodon (mastós 'breast' + odoús 'tooth') is any proboscidean belonging to the extinct genus Mammut (family Mammutidae) that inhabited North and Central America during the late Miocene or late Pliocene up to their extinction at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 to 11,000 years ago.[1] Mastodons lived in herds and were predominantly forest-dwelling animals. They survived on a mixed diet and obtained food by browsing and grazing, somewhat similar to their distant relatives, modern elephants, but probably with greater emphasis on browsing","image":"Mammut_americanum.jpg.webp","url":"Mastodon"}
