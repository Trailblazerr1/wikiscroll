{"title":"List of Nintendo 64 games","summary":"The list of Nintendo 64 games includes 393 licensed releases spanning from the platform's launch in 1996 to the final release in 2002. The Nintendo 64 home video game console's library of games were primarily released in a plastic ROM cartridge called the Game Pak. This strategic choice of high-performance but lower-capacity medium was met with some controversy compared to CD-ROM.[1][2][3][4] Two small indentations on the back of each cartridge allows it to connect or pass through the system's cartridge dustcover flaps.[5] All regions have the same connectors, and region-locked cartridges will fit into the other regions' systems by using a cartridge converter or by simply removing the cartridge's casing.[6] However, the systems are also equipped with lockout chips that will only allow them to play their appropriate games. Both Japanese and North American systems have the same NTSC lockout, and Europe has a PAL lockout. A bypass device such as the N64 Passport or the Datel Action Replay can be used to play import games, but a few require an additional boot code.[7]","image":"N64-Console-Set.jpg.webp"}
