{"title":"Audio power amplifier","summary":"An audio power amplifier (or power amp) is an electronic amplifier that amplifies low-power electronic audio signals such as the signal from radio receiver or electric guitar pickup to a level that is high enough for driving loudspeakers or headphones. Audio power amplifiers are found in all manner of sound systems including sound reinforcement, public address and home audio systems and musical instrument amplifiers like guitar amplifiers.  It is the final electronic stage in a typical audio playback chain before the signal is sent to the loudspeakers.","image":"Unitra_ws-503_arch1_(1).jpg.webp"}
