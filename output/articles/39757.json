{"title":"Scuba diving","summary":"Scuba diving is a type of underwater diving whereby divers use breathing equipment that is completely independent of a surface air supply.[1] The name \"scuba\", an acronym for \"Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus\", was coined by Christian J. Lambertsen in a patent submitted in 1952. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air,[2] affording them greater independence and movement than surface-supplied divers, and more time underwater than free divers.[1] Although the use of compressed air is common, a gas blend with a higher oxygen content, known as enriched air or nitrox, has become popular due to the reduced nitrogen intake during, long, and/or repetitive dives. Also, breathing gas diluted with helium may be used to reduce the likelihood and effects of nitrogen narcosis during deeper dives.","image":"Buzo.jpg.webp","url":"Scuba_diving"}
