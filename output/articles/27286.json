{"title":"London boroughs","summary":"The London boroughs are the 32 local authority districts that make up the ceremonial county of Greater London; each is governed by a London borough council. The present London boroughs were all created at the same time as Greater London on 1 April 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 and are a type of local government district. Twelve were designated as Inner London boroughs and twenty as Outer London boroughs. The City of London, the historic centre, is a separate ceremonial county and sui generis local government district that functions quite differently from a London borough. However, the two counties together comprise the region of Greater London, all of which is also governed by the Greater London Authority.","image":"Greater_London_in_England_(wo_City_of_London)_(zoom).svg.png.webp","url":"London_boroughs"}
