{"title":"Nine Years' War","summary":"The Nine Years' War (1688â€“1697), often called the War of the Grand Alliance or the War of the League of Augsburg,[8] was a conflict between France and a European coalition which mainly included the Holy Roman Empire (led by the Habsburg Monarchy), the Dutch Republic, England, Spain, Savoy and Portugal.  It was fought in Europe and the surrounding seas, in North America, and in India. It is sometimes considered the first global war. The conflict encompassed the Williamite war in Ireland and Jacobite risings in Scotland, where William III and James II struggled for control of England and Ireland, and a campaign in colonial North America between French and English settlers and their respective Indigenous allies.","image":"Siege_of_Namur_(1692).JPG.webp"}
