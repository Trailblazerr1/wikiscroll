{"title":"Photometry (astronomy)","summary":"Photometry, from Greek photo- (\"light\") and -metry (\"measure\"), is a technique used in astronomy that is concerned with measuring the flux or intensity of light radiated by astronomical objects.[1] This light is measured through a telescope using a photometer, often made using electronic devices such as a CCD photometer or a photoelectric photometer that converts light into an electric current by the photoelectric effect. When calibrated against standard stars (or other light sources) of known intensity and colour, photometers can measure the brightness or apparent magnitude of celestial objects.","image":"Kepler_Mission_Space_Photometer_smaller.jpg.webp"}
