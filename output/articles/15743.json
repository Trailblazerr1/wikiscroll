{"title":"Familial hypercholesterolemia","summary":"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by high cholesterol levels, specifically very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, \"bad cholesterol\"), in the blood and early cardiovascular disease. The most common mutations diminish the number of functional LDL receptors in the liver. Since the underlying body biochemistry is slightly different in individuals with FH, their high cholesterol levels are less responsive to the kinds of cholesterol control methods which are usually more effective in people without FH (such as dietary modification and statin tablets). Nevertheless, treatment (including higher statin doses) is usually effective.","image":"Xanthelasma_palpebrarum.jpg.webp","url":"Familial_hypercholesterolemia"}
