{"title":"States and territories of Australia","summary":"The states and territories are federated administrative divisions in Australia, ruled by regional governments that constitute the second level of governance between the federal government and local governments.  States are self-governing polities with incomplete sovereignty (having ceded some sovereign rights to federation) and have their own constitutions, legislatures, departments, and certain civil authorities (e.g. judiciary and law enforcement) that administer and deliver most public policies and programmes. Territories can be autonomous and administer local policies and programmes much like the states  in practice, but are still constitutionally and financially subordinate to the federal government and thus have no true sovereignty.","image":"Australia_states_and_territories_labelled.svg.png.webp"}
