{"title":"Permeability (electromagnetism)","summary":"In electromagnetism, permeability is the measure of magnetization that a material obtains in response to an applied magnetic field.  Permeability is typically represented by the (italicized) Greek letter Î¼. The term was coined in September 1885 by Oliver Heaviside. The reciprocal of permeability is magnetic reluctivity.","image":"205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676.svg"}
