{"title":"Kippah","summary":"A kippah (/kiˈpɑː/; Hebrew: כִּיפָּה‎, romanized: Kipah, plural כִּיפּוֹת Kipot), also called a koppel (Yiddish: קאפל‎, kopel), or yarmulke (/ˈjɑːrməlkə/ listen; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע‎), is a brimless cap, usually made of cloth, traditionally worn by Jewish males to fulfill the customary requirement that the head be covered. It is worn by men in Orthodox communities at all times. Among non-Orthodox communities, those who wear them customarily do so only during prayer, while attending a synagogue, or in other rituals. Most synagogues and Jewish funeral parlors keep a ready supply of kippot.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
