The attorney general serves as the principal legal adviser to the Crown and the Government in England and Wales. The attorney general maintains the Attorney General's Office and currently attends (but is not a member of) Cabinet. Unlike in other countries utilizing the common law legal system, the Attorney General does not administer the judicial system; that function is carried out by the Secretary of State for Justice.
