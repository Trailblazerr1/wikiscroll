{"title":"History of painting","summary":"The history of painting reaches back in time to artifacts from pre-historic humans, and spans all cultures. It represents a continuous, though periodically disrupted, tradition from Antiquity. Across cultures, and spanning continents and millennia, the history of painting is an ongoing river of creativity, that continues into the 21st century.[1] Until the early 20th century it relied primarily on representational, religious and classical motifs, after which time more purely abstract and conceptual approaches gained favor.","image":"Lubang_Jeriji_Sal√©h_cave_painting_of_Bull.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_painting"}
