{"title":"Brothel","summary":"A brothel, bordello, ranch,[2] or whorehouse is a place where people engage in sexual activity with prostitutes.[3] However, for legal or cultural reasons, establishments often describe themselves as massage parlors, bars, strip clubs, body rub parlours, studios, or by some other description. Sex work in a brothel is considered safer than street prostitution.[4]","image":"Joachim_Beuckelaer_-_Brothel_-_Walters_371784.jpg.webp","url":"Brothel"}
