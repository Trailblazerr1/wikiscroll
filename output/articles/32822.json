{"title":"Old Italic scripts","summary":"The Old Italic scripts are a family of similar ancient writing systems used in the Italian Peninsula between around 700 and 100 BC, for various languages spoken in that time and place. The most notable member is the Etruscan alphabet, which was the immediate ancestor of the Latin alphabet currently used by English and many other languages of the world.  The runic alphabets used in northern Europe are believed to have been separately derived from one of these alphabets by the 2nd century AD.","image":"Marsiliana_tablet.svg.png.webp","url":"Old_Italic_scripts"}
