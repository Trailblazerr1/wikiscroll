{"title":"Algonquian languages","summary":"The Algonquian languages (/ælˈɡɒŋkiən/ or /ælˈɡɒŋkwiən/;[1] also Algonkian) are a subfamily of American indigenous languages that include most languages in the Algic language family. The name of the Algonquian language family is distinguished from the orthographically similar Algonquin dialect of the Indigenous Ojibwe language (Chippewa), which is a senior member of the Algonquian language family. The term Algonquin has been suggested to derive from the Maliseet word elakómkwik (pronounced [ɛlæˈɡomoɡwik]), \"they are our relatives/allies\".[2][3] A number of Algonquian languages, like many other Native American languages, are now extinct.","image":"Algonquian_language_map_with_states_and_provinces.svg.png.webp"}
