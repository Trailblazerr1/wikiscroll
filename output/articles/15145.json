{"title":"Escherichia coli in molecular biology","summary":"Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/; commonly abbreviated E. coli) is a Gram-negative gammaproteobacterium commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms).  The descendants of two isolates, K-12 and B strain, are used routinely in molecular biology as both a tool and a model organism.","image":"Fluorescent_E.coli_colonies_pGLO.jpg.webp"}
