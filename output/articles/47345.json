{"title":"Vichy France","summary":"Vichy France (French: Régime de Vichy; 10 July 1940 – 9 August 1944) is the common name of the French State (État français) headed by Marshal Philippe Pétain during World War II. The regime was authoritarian, xenophobic, antisemitic and traditionalist in nature. Officially independent, it adopted a policy of collaboration with Nazi Germany, which occupied its northern and western portions before occupying the remainder of Metropolitan France in November 1942. Though Paris was ostensibly its capital, the Vichy government established itself in the resort town of Vichy in the unoccupied \"Free Zone\" (zone libre), where it remained responsible for the civil administration of France as well as its colonies.[3]","image":"Flag_of_France_(1794–1815%2C_1830–1958).svg.png.webp","url":"Vichy_France"}
