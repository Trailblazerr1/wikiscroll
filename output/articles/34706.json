{"title":"Pharnavaz I of Iberia","summary":"Pharnavaz I[a] (/fɑːrnɑːvɑːz/; Georgian: ფარნავაზ I Georgian pronunciation: [pʰɑrnɑvɑz]) was a king of Kartli, an ancient Georgian kingdom known as Iberia in classical antiquity. The Georgian Chronicles credits him with being the first monarch founding the kingship of Kartli and the Pharnavazid dynasty, while other independent chronicles, such as The Conversion of Kartli make him the second Georgian monarch. Based on the medieval evidence, most scholars locate Pharnavaz's rule in the 3rd century BC: 302–237 BC according to Prince Vakhushti of Kartli, 299–234 BC according to Cyril Toumanoff and 284–219 BC according to Pavle Ingoroqva.[6] Pharnavaz's rise, advent and imperial expansion of the Iberian monarchy was directly tied to the victory of Alexander the Great over the Achaemenid Empire.[7][8] Pharnavaz ruled under the suzerainty of the Seleucid Empire.[9]","image":"Pharnavaz_I_relief_(2).jpg.webp","url":"Pharnavaz_I_of_Iberia"}
