{"title":"White Anglo-Saxon Protestants","summary":"In the United States, White Anglo-Saxon Protestants or WASPs are the white American Protestant elite, typically of British descent.[1] WASP elites have dominated American society, culture, and politics for most of the history of the United States. After 1945, many Americans criticized the WASP hegemony and disparaged them as part of \"The Establishment\".[2][3] Although the social influence of wealthy WASPs has declined since the 1940s, the group continues to play a central role in American finance, politics and philanthropy.[4]","image":"WashingtonNationalCathedralHighsmith15393v.jpg.webp","url":"White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestants"}
