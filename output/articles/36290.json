{"title":"Protease","summary":"A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is an enzyme that catalyzes (increases reaction rate or \"speeds up\") proteolysis, breaking down proteins into smaller polypeptides or single amino acids, and spurring the formation of new protein products.[1] They do this by cleaving the peptide bonds within proteins by hydrolysis, a reaction where water breaks bonds. Proteases are involved in many biological functions, including digestion of ingested proteins, protein catabolism (breakdown of old proteins),[2][3] and cell signaling.","image":"TEV_protease_summary.png.webp"}
