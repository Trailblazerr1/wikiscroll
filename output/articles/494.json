{"title":"2010 Canterbury earthquake","summary":"The 2010 Canterbury earthquake (also known as the Darfield earthquake)[7] struck the South Island of New Zealand with a moment magnitude of 7.1[1][2] at 4:35Â am local time on 4 September, and had a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale.[1] Some damaging aftershocks followed the main event, the strongest of which was a magnitude 6.3 shock known as the Christchurch earthquake that occurred nearly six months later on 22 February 2011.[8] Because this aftershock was centred very close to Christchurch, it was much more destructive and resulted in the deaths of 185 people.[9]","image":"New_Zealand_relief_map.jpg.webp","url":"2010_Canterbury_earthquake"}
