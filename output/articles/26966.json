{"title":"List of presidents of Pakistan","summary":"The president of Pakistan is the head of state of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. According to the Constitution of Pakistan, the president has \"powers, subject to Supreme Court approval or veto, to dissolve the National Assembly, triggering new elections, and thereby dismissing the prime minister\".[1] These powers were repeatedly modified through amendments to the constitution, which were introduced as the results of military coups and changes in government. Since the 18th Amendment to the Constitution was passed in 2010, Pakistan has been shifted back from semi-presidential to a parliamentary republic. Under that system, the president has limited ruling powers, and performs ceremonial duties while the Prime Minister enjoys more powers to execute decisions.[2] The president is chosen by the Electoral College composed of the Senate, the National Assembly and the Provincial Assemblies.[3]","image":"Flag_of_the_President_of_Pakistan.svg.png.webp"}
