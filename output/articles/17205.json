{"title":"Funicular","summary":"A funicular (/fjuːˈnɪkjʊlər/, /f(j)ʊ-/, /fə-/)[1] is a type of cable railway system which connects points along a railway track laid on a steep slope. The system is characterized by two counterbalanced carriages (also called cars or trains) permanently attached to opposite ends of a haulage cable, which is looped over a pulley at the upper end of the track.[2][3] The result of such a configuration is that the two carriages move synchronously: as one ascends, the other descends at an equal speed. This feature distinguishes funiculars from inclined elevators, which have a single car that is hauled uphill.[2][3][4]","image":"Baku_Funicular.jpg.webp","url":"Funicular"}
