{"title":"GNU Emacs","summary":"GNU Emacs is a free software text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is extensible using a Turing complete programming language. GNU Emacs has been called \"the most powerful text editor available today\".[4] With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999.[5] Throughout its history, GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project, and a flagship of the free software movement.[6][7] GNU Emacs is sometimes abbreviated as GNUMACS, especially to differentiate it from other EMACS variants.[8] The tag line for GNU Emacs is \"the extensible self-documenting text editor\".[9]","image":"Emacs-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"GNU_Emacs"}
