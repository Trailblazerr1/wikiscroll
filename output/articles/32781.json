{"title":"Oil","summary":"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally \"water fearing\") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally \"fat loving\"). Oils are usually flammable and surface active. Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.","image":"Italian_olive_oil_2007.jpg.webp","url":"Oil"}
