{"title":"Mishneh Torah","summary":"The Mishneh Torah (Hebrew: מִשְׁנֵה תּוֹרָה‎, \"Repetition of the Torah\"), also known as Sefer Yad ha-Hazaka (ספר יד החזקה \"Book of the Strong Hand\"), is a code of Rabbinic Jewish religious law (Halakha) authored by Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon). The Mishneh Torah was compiled between 1170 and 1180 CE (4930 and 4940 AM), while Maimonides was living in Egypt, and is regarded as Maimonides' magnum opus. Accordingly, later sources simply refer to the work as \"Maimon\", \"Maimonides\", or \"RaMBaM\", although Maimonides composed other works.","image":"Maimonides-2.jpg.webp","url":"Mishneh_Torah"}
