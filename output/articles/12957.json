{"title":"Differential diagnosis","summary":"In healthcare, a differential diagnosis (abbreviated DDx) is a method of analysis of a patient's history and physical examination to arrive at the correct diagnosis.  It involves distinguishing a particular disease or condition from others that present with similar clinical features.[1] Differential diagnostic procedures are used by clinicians to diagnose the specific disease in a patient, or, at least, to consider any imminently life-threatening conditions. Often, each individual option of a possible disease is called a differential diagnosis (e.g., acute bronchitis could be a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of a cough, even if the final diagnosis is common cold).","image":"3ae0861080dccdf4dc5da66ff5232eaa35a5dae0.svg","url":"Differential_diagnosis"}
