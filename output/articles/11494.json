{"title":"Crippled America","summary":"Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again is a non-fiction book by businessman (and, later, 45th president of the United States) Donald Trump, first published in hardcover by Simon & Schuster in 2015. A revised edition was subsequently republished eight months later in trade paperback format under the title Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America. Like his previous work Time to Get Tough (2011) did for the U.S. presidential election in 2012, Crippled America outlined Trump's political agenda as he ran in the 2016 election on a conservative platform.","image":"Crippled_America_-_How_to_Make_America_Great_Again.jpg.webp"}
