{"title":"Hydroxylamine","summary":"Hydroxylamine is an inorganic compound with the formula NH2OH. The pure material is a white, unstable crystalline, hygroscopic compound.[4] However, hydroxylamine is almost always provided and used as an aqueous solution. It is used to prepare oximes, an important functional group. It is also an intermediate in biological nitrification. In biological nitrification, the oxidation of NH3 to hydroxylamine is mediated by the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase (AMO).[5] Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) further oxidizes hydroxylamine to nitrite.[6]","image":"Hydroxylamine-2D.png.webp"}
