{"title":"Copolymer","summary":"In polymer chemistry, a copolymer is a polymer derived from more than one species of monomer. The polymerization of monomers into copolymers is called copolymerization. Copolymers obtained by copolymerization of two monomer species are sometimes called bipolymers.  Those obtained from three and four monomers are called terpolymers and quaterpolymers, respectively.[1]","image":"Copolymers.svg.png.webp","url":"Copolymer"}
