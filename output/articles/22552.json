{"title":"Isle of Dogs","summary":"The Isle of Dogs is a large peninsula bounded on three sides by a large meander in the River Thames in East London, England, which includes the Cubitt Town, Millwall and Canary Wharf districts. The area was historically part of the Manor, Hamlet, Parish and, for a time, the wider borough of Poplar. The name had no official status until the 1987 creation of the Isle of Dogs Neighbourhood by Tower Hamlets London Borough Council.  It has been known locally as simply \"the Island\" since the 19th century.[1]","image":"Isle_of_Dogs_within_Central_London.svg.png.webp","url":"Isle_of_Dogs"}
