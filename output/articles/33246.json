{"title":"Ordovician–Silurian extinction events","summary":"The Ordovician–Silurian extinction events, also known as the Late Ordovician mass extinction, are collectively the second-largest of the five major extinction events in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct. Extinction was global during this period, eliminating 49–60% of marine genera and nearly 85% of marine species.[1] Only the Permian-Triassic mass extinction exceeds the Late Ordovician mass extinction in biodiversity loss. The extinction event abruptly affected all major taxonomic groups and caused the disappearance of one third of all brachiopod and bryozoan families, as well as numerous groups of conodonts, trilobites, echinoderms, corals, bivalves, and graptolites.[2][3] This extinction was the first of the \"big five\" Phanerozoic mass extinction events and was the first to significantly affect animal-based communities.[4] However, the Late Ordovician mass extinction did not produce major changes to ecosystem structures compared to other mass extinctions, nor did it lead to any particular morphological innovations. Diversity gradually recovered to pre-extinction levels over the first 5 million years of the Silurian period.[5][6][7][8]","image":"Extinction_intensity.svg.png.webp"}
