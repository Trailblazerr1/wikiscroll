{"title":"Computer-aided design","summary":"Computer-aided design (CAD) is the use of computers (or workstations) to aid in the creation, modification, analysis, or optimization of a design.[1] This software is used to increase the productivity of the designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing.[2] Designs made through CAD software are helpful in protecting products and inventions when used in patent applications. CAD output is often in the form of electronic files for  print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The term CADD (for computer aided design and drafting) is also used.[3]","image":"Schneckengetriebe.png.webp"}
