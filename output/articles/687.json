{"title":"2017 Women's March","summary":"The Women's March[13][14][15][lower-alpha 1] was a worldwide protest on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of President Donald Trump. It was prompted by the fact that several of Trump's statements were considered by many as anti-women or otherwise offensive to women.[13][19] It was the largest single-day protest in U.S. history.[20] The goal of the annual marches is to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues, including women's rights, immigration reform, healthcare reform, disability justice, reproductive rights, the environment, LGBTQ rights, racial equality, freedom of religion,[21] workers' rights and tolerance. According to organizers, the goal was to \"send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights\".[22]","image":"Women's_March_on_Washington_(32593123745).jpg.webp"}
