{"title":"Online and offline","summary":"In computer technology and telecommunications, online indicates a state of connectivity and offline indicates a disconnected state. In modern terminology, this usually refers to an Internet connection, but (especially when expressed \"on line\" or \"on the line\") could refer to any piece of equipment or functional unit that is connected to a larger system.  Being online means that the equipment or subsystem is connected, or that it is ready for use.[1]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
