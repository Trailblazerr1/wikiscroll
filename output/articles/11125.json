{"title":"Cooper Union","summary":"The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, commonly known as Cooper Union[11] and informally referred to, especially during the 19th century, as the Cooper Institute,[12] is a private college at Cooper Square in New York City. Inspired in 1830 when Peter Cooper learned about the government-supported Ã‰cole Polytechnique in France, Cooper Union was established in 1859.[13][14] The school was built on a radical new model of American higher education based on founder Peter Cooper's fundamental belief that an education \"equal to the best technology schools established\"[15] should be accessible to those who qualify, independent of their race, religion, sex, wealth or social status, and should be \"open and free to all.\"[16]","image":"The_Cooper_Union's_Foundation_Building_-_North_Side_(48072759802).jpg.webp"}
