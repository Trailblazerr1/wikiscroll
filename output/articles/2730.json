{"title":"Aldosterone","summary":"Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.[1][2] It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon.[3]  It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure, plasma sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) levels. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.[3] It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.[4] When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease.[5] Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.[4]","image":"Aldosterone-2D-skeletal.svg.png.webp","url":"Aldosterone"}
