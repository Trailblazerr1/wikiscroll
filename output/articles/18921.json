{"title":"Green bean","summary":"Green beans are the unripe, young fruit of various cultivars of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris).[1][2] Immature or young pods of the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus), yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis), and hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus) are used in a similar way.[3] Green beans are known by many common names, including French beans,[4] string beans,[4] snap beans,[4] snaps,[5][6] and the French name haricot vert. They are also known as Baguio beans or habichuelas in the Philippines, to distinguish them from yardlong beans.[7]","image":"Heaps_of_beans.jpg.webp","url":"Green_bean"}
