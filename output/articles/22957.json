{"title":"James Prescott Joule","summary":"James Prescott Joule FRS FRSE (/dʒuːl/;[1][2][lower-alpha 1] 24 December 1818 –  11 October 1889) was an English physicist, mathematician and brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. Joule studied the nature of heat, and discovered its relationship to mechanical work (see energy). This led to the law of conservation of energy, which in turn led to the development of the first law of thermodynamics. The SI derived unit of energy, the joule, is named after him.","image":"Joule_James_sitting.jpg.webp","url":"James_Prescott_Joule"}
