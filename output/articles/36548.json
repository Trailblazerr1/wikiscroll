{"title":"Pure Michigan Byway","summary":"A Pure Michigan Byway is the designation for a segment of the State Trunkline Highway System in the US state of Michigan that is a \"scenic, recreational, or historic route that is representative of Michigan's natural and cultural heritage.\"[2] The designation was created with the name Michigan Heritage Route by the state legislature on June 22, 1993, and since then six historic, seven recreational and seven scenic byways have been designated by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), and another two have been proposed. These byways have been designated in both the Upper and Lower peninsulas (UP, LP) of the state. The current name was adopted on December 30, 2014, and it references the Pure Michigan tourism marketing campaign.","image":"Pure_Michigan_Byway.svg.png.webp"}
