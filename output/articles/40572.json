{"title":"Sicilian Mafia","summary":"The Sicilian Mafia, also simply known as the Mafia and frequently referred to as La Cosa Nostra (Italian: [ˈkɔːza ˈnɔstra, ˈkɔːsa -], Sicilian: [ˈkɔːsa ˈnɔʂː(ɽ)a]; \"our thing\") by its members, is an Italian Mafia-terrorist-type[3] organized crime syndicate and criminal society originating in the region of Sicily and dating to at least the 19th century. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct, and present themselves to the public under a common brand. The basic group is known as a \"family\", \"clan\", or cosca.[4] Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (borgata) of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \"men of honour\", although the public often refers to them as mafiosi. By the 20th century, following wide-scale emigration from Sicily, mafiosi established gangs in North and South America which replicate the traditions and methods of their Sicilian ancestors. Since the 90s, the Sicilian mafia has lost much of its influence in favor of the 'Ndrangheta, originating from the nearby region of Calabria, which is today the most powerful criminal organization in Italy and in the world.[5]","image":"SicilianMafia1900Cutrera.jpg.webp","url":"Sicilian_Mafia"}
