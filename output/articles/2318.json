{"title":"Afghan mujahideen","summary":"The Afghan mujahideen were various armed Islamist rebel groups that fought against the government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War and the subsequent First Afghan Civil War. The term mujahideen (Arabic: مجاهدين‎) is used in a religious context by Muslims to refer those engaged in a struggle of any nature for the sake of Islam, commonly referred to as jihad (جهاد‎‎). The Afghan mujahideen consisted of numerous groups that differed from each other across ethnic and/or ideological lines, but were united by their anti-communist and pro-Islamic goals. The union was also widely referred to by their Western backers as the Afghan resistance, while Western press often referred to them as Muslim rebels, guerrillas, or \"Mountain Men\". They were popularly referred to by Soviet troops as dukhi (Russian: дýхи, lit. 'spirits') as derivation from Dari word دشمان‎ dushman, which turned into short dukh and also was suitable due to their guerrilla tactics; Afghan civilians often referred to them as the tanzim (Pashto/Persian: تنظیم, transl. 'organization'), while the Afghan government called them dushman (دشمان‎, lit. 'enemy'), a term also employed by the Soviets (душмáны, Dushmany).","image":"October_87_-_Khalis-loyal_Muja.jpg.webp","url":"Afghan_mujahideen"}
