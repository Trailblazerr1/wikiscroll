{"title":"Peveril Castle","summary":"Peveril Castle (also Castleton Castle or Peak Castle)[3] is a ruined 11th-century castle overlooking the village of Castleton in the English county of Derbyshire. It was the main settlement (or caput) of the feudal barony of William Peverel, known as the Honour of Peverel,[4] and was founded some time between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and its first recorded mention in the Domesday Survey of 1086, by Peverel, who held lands in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as a tenant-in-chief of the king. The town became the economic centre of the barony. The castle has views across the Hope Valley and Cave Dale.","image":"Peveril_Castle_keep%2C_2009.jpg.webp","url":"Peveril_Castle"}
