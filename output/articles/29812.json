{"title":"Microtubule","summary":"Microtubules are polymers of tubulin that form part of the cytoskeleton and provide structure and shape to eukaryotic cells. Microtubules can grow as long as 50 micrometres and are highly dynamic. The outer diameter of a microtubule is between 23 and 27 nm[2] while the inner diameter is between 11 and 15 nm.[3] They are formed by the polymerization of a dimer of two globular proteins, alpha and beta tubulin into protofilaments that can then associate laterally to form a hollow tube, the microtubule.[4]  The most common form of a microtubule consists of 13 protofilaments in the tubular arrangement.","image":"lossy-page1-220px-Microtubules_in_the_leading_edge_of_a_cell.tif.jpg.webp"}
