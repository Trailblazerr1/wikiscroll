{"title":"Color blindness","summary":"Color blindness (color vision deficiency) is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color.[3] It can impair tasks such as selecting ripe fruit, choosing clothing, and reading traffic lights.[3] Color blindness may make some educational activities more difficult.[3] However, problems are generally minor, and most color-blind people adapt.[3] People with total color blindness (achromatopsia) may also be uncomfortable in bright environments[3] and have decreased visual acuity.","image":"Ishihara_9.svg.png.webp"}
