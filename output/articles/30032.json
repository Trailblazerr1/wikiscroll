{"title":"Miniature Schnauzer","summary":"The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers may have been developed from the smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer,[3][4] or crosses between the standard and one or more smaller breeds such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Pinscher, and Poodles,[5][6][7][8] as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as \"spunky\"[1] but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs' predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in four colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, salt and pepper, and white.[9]","image":"Цвергшнауцер_окрас_черный_с_серебром.JPG.webp","url":"Miniature_Schnauzer"}
