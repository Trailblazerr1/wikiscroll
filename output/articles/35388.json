{"title":"Political aspects of Islam","summary":"Political aspects of Islam are derived from the Quran, hadith literature, and sunnah (the sayings and living habits of the Islamic prophet Muhammad), history of Islam, and elements of political movements outside Islam.[1] Traditional political concepts in Islam include leadership by elected or selected successors to Muhammad, known as Caliphs in Sunni Islam and Imams in Shia Islam; the importance of following the Islamic law (sharia); the duty of rulers to seek Shura or consultation from their subjects; and the importance of rebuking unjust rulers.[2]","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp"}
