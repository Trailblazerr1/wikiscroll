{"title":"Mersenne prime","summary":"In mathematics, a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two.  That is, it is a prime number of the form Mn = 2n − 1 for some integer n.  They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century.  If n is a composite number then so is 2n − 1.  Therefore, an equivalent definition of the Mersenne primes is that they are the prime numbers of the form Mp = 2p − 1 for some prime p.","image":"c59cc86a8693e714f1c765f4eab21d76c0195abc.svg","url":"Mersenne_prime"}
