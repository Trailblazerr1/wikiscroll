{"title":"Bento","summary":"A bento (弁当, bentō)[1] is a single-portion take-out or home-packed meal of Japanese origin. Outside Japan, it is common in Chinese and Korean cuisines, as well as in Southeast Asian cuisines where rice is the main staple food. A traditional bento may contain rice or noodles with fish or meat, often with pickled and cooked vegetables in a box.[2] Containers range from mass-produced disposables to hand-crafted lacquerware. Often various dividers are used to separate ingredients or dishes, especially those with strong flavors, to avoid them affecting the taste of the rest of the meal. A typical divider is green plastic grass (referred to as 'sushi grass' in the United States). This also works to stem the growth of bacteria.[3] Bento are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including convenience stores, bento shops (弁当屋, bentō-ya), railway stations, and department stores. However, Japanese homemakers often spend time and energy on carefully prepared box lunches for their spouses, children, or themselves. Outside Japan, the term bento box may be used (e.g., on English menus for Japanese restaurants).","image":"Bento_box_from_a_grocery_store.jpg.webp"}
