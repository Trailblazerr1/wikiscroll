{"title":"Progressive supranuclear palsy","summary":"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a late-onset degenerative disease involving the gradual deterioration and death of specific volumes of the brain.[2][3] The condition leads to symptoms including loss of balance, slowing of movement, difficulty moving the eyes, and cognitive impairment.[2]  PSP may be mistaken for other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's. The cause of the condition is uncertain, but involves accumulation of tau protein within the brain.  Medications such as levodopa and amantadine may be useful in some cases.[2]","image":"Steele-olszewski-richardson_disease.jpg.webp"}
