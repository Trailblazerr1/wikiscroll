{"title":"1993 World Trade Center bombing","summary":"The 1993 World Trade Center bombing was a terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, carried out on February 26, 1993, when a truck bomb detonated below the North Tower of the complex. The 1,336 lb (606 kg) urea nitrate–hydrogen gas enhanced device[1] was intended to send the North Tower (Tower 1) crashing into the South Tower (Tower 2), bringing both towers down and killing tens of thousands of people. It failed to do so, but killed six people, including a pregnant woman,[2] and injured over one thousand.[3] About 50,000 people were evacuated from the buildings that day.[4][5]","image":"WTC_1993_ATF_Commons.jpg.webp"}
