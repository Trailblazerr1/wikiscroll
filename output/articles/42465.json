{"title":"Strawberry Fields Forever","summary":"\"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon and credited to Lennonâ€“McCartney. It was released on 13 February 1967 as a double A-side single with \"Penny Lane\". It represented a departure from the group's previous singles and a novel listening experience for the contemporary pop audience. While the song initially divided and confused music critics and the group's fans, it proved highly influential on the emerging psychedelic genre. Its accompanying promotional film is similarly recognised as a pioneering work in the medium of music video.[6]","image":"Pennystrawps.jpg.webp","url":"Strawberry_Fields_Forever"}
