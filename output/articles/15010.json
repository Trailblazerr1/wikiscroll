{"title":"Equation of state","summary":"In physics and thermodynamics, an equation of state is a thermodynamic equation relating state variables which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as pressure, volume, temperature (PVT), or internal energy.[1] Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.","image":"Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Equation_of_state"}
