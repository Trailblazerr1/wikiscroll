{"title":"Chelation","summary":"Chelation /ˈkiːˌleɪˈʃən/ is a type of bonding of ions and molecules to metal ions. It involves the formation or presence of two or more separate coordinate bonds between a polydentate (multiple bonded) ligand and a single central metal atom.[1][2]  These ligands are called chelants, chelators, chelating agents, or sequestering agents.  They are usually organic compounds, but this is not a necessity, as in the case of zinc and its use as a maintenance therapy to prevent the absorption of copper in people with Wilson's disease.[3]","image":"Me-EN.svg.png.webp","url":"Chelation"}
