{"title":"Open format","summary":"An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets. Open formats are also called free file formats if they are not encumbered by any copyrights, patents, trademarks or other restrictions (for example, if they are in the public domain[1]) so that anyone may use the format at no monetary cost for any desired purpose.[2] However, the actual image used by an open format may still be copyrighted or trademarked.","image":"UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg.png.webp","url":"Open_format"}
