{"title":"Brand awareness","summary":"Brand awareness is the extent to which customers are able to recall or recognize a brand under different conditions.[1] Brand awareness is one of two dimensions from brand knowledge, an associative network memory model.[2] Brand awareness is a key consideration in consumer behavior, advertising management, and brand management. The consumer's ability to recognize or recall a brand is central to purchasing decision-making. Purchasing cannot proceed unless a consumer is first aware of a product category and a brand within that category. Awareness does not necessarily mean that the consumer must be able to recall a specific brand name, but they must be able to recall enough distinguishing features for purchasing to proceed.","image":"Shopping_list_(2098182380).jpg.webp"}
