{"title":"Aberration (astronomy)","summary":"In astronomy, aberration (also referred to as astronomical aberration, stellar aberration, or velocity aberration) is a phenomenon which produces an apparent motion of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer. It causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary. The change in angle is of the order of v/c where c is the speed of light and v the velocity of the observer. In the case of \"stellar\" or \"annual\" aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth's velocity changes as it revolves around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20Â arcseconds in right ascension or declination.","image":"Simple_stellar_aberration_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Aberration_(astronomy)"}
