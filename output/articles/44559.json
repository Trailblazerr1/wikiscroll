The Tribune is owned by The Salt Lake Tribune, Inc., a non-profit corporation. For almost 100 years, it was a family-owned newspaper held by the heirs of U.S. Senator Thomas Kearns. After Kearns died in 1918, the company was controlled by his widow, Jennie Judge Kearns, and then the newspaper's longtime publisher was John F.

Gallivan, nephew of Mrs. Kearns, joined the Tribune in 1937 and succeeded Fitzpatrick as publisher in 1960, remaining as Chairman until the merger with TCI, Inc. in 1997.","image":"The_Salt_Lake_Tribune_front_page.jpg.webp"}
