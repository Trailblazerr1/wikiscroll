{"title":"Health and appearance of Michael Jackson","summary":"Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an African-American[1] entertainer who spent over four decades in the public eye, first as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. From the mid-1980s, Jackson's appearance began to change, triggering speculation in the media that he wanted to look more white.[2] He was diagnosed with the skin disorder vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin and sensitivity to sunlight. To treat the condition, he used fair-colored makeup[3] and likely skin whitening prescription creams[4] to even out his skin. The lighter skin resulted in criticism that he was trying to appear white.[5] Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not.[6]","image":"Michael_Jackson_Dangerous_World_Tour_1993_cropped.png.webp"}
