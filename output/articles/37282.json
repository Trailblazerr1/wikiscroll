{"title":"Real Time with Bill Maher","summary":"Real Time with Bill Maher is an American television talk show that airs weekly on HBO, hosted by comedian and political satirist Bill Maher. Much like his previous series Politically Incorrect on Comedy Central and later on ABC, Real Time features a panel of guests who discuss current events in politics and the media. Unlike the previous show, guests are usually better versed in the subject matter: more experts such as journalists, professors, and politicians participate in the panel, and fewer actors and celebrities are included.","image":"Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher_open_2017.png.webp","url":"Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher"}
