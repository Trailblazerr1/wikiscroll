{"title":"Judaea (Roman province)","summary":"Judaea (Latin: Iūdaea; Greek: Ἰουδαία Iudaia; Hebrew: יהודה‎, Standard Yəhūda Tiberian Yehūḏā) was a Roman province which incorporated the regions of Judea, Samaria and Idumea, and extended over parts of the former regions of the Hasmonean and Herodian kingdoms of Judea. It was named after Herod Archelaus's Tetrarchy of Judaea, but the Roman province encompassed a much larger territory. The name \"Judaea\" was derived from the Kingdom of Judah of the 6th century BCE.","image":"First_century_Iudaea_province.gif","url":"Judaea_(Roman_province)"}
