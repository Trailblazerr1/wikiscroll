{"title":"General Court (European Union)","summary":"The General Court, informally known as the European General Court (EGC), is a constituent court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. It hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the European Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Court_of_Justice_of_the_European_Union.svg.png.webp","url":"General_Court_(European_Union)"}
