{"title":"Passion (emotion)","summary":"Passion (Greek πάσχω \"to suffer, to be acted on\"[1] and Late Latin (chiefly Christian[2]) passio \"passion; suffering\" (from Latin pati \"to suffer\"; participle: passus)) is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or something. Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person. It is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term lust.","image":"Frederick_Goodall_RA_-_Passionate_encounter.jpg.webp","url":"Passion_(emotion)"}
