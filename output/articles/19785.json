{"title":"Hatikvah","summary":"\"Hatikvah\" (Hebrew: הַתִּקְוָה‎, pronounced [hatikˈva], lit. English: \"The Hope\") is a 19th-century Jewish poem and the national anthem of Israel. The theme of the romantic composition reflects the Jews' 2,000-year-old hope of returning to the Land of Israel and reclaiming it as a free and sovereign nation. Its lyrics are adapted from a poem by Naftali Herz Imber, a Jewish poet from Złoczów (today Zolochiv, Ukraine), which was then in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria under Austrian rule.[1] Imber wrote the first version of the poem in 1877, while he was a guest of a Jewish scholar in Iași, Romania.","image":"Cigarette_silk_depicting_Zionist_flag_(3560854953).jpg.webp"}
