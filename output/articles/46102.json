{"title":"Tuatara","summary":"Tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia.[7] Their name derives from the MƒÅori language, and means \"peaks on the back\".[8] The single species of tuatara is the sole surviving member of its order,[9] which originated in the Triassic period around 250 million years ago[10][11] and which flourished during the Mesozoic era.[12] Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes).[13] For this reason, tuatara are of interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs (including birds) and crocodilians.","image":"Tuatara_(5205719005).jpg.webp"}
