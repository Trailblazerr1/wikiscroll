{"title":"Rāja yoga","summary":"In Sanskrit texts, Rāja yoga (/ˈrɑːdʒə ˈjoʊɡə/) was both the goal of yoga and a method to attain it. The term also became a modern name for the practice of yoga[1][2] in the 19th-century when  Swami Vivekananda gave his interpretation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali in his book Raja Yoga.[3] Since then, Rāja yoga has variously been called aṣṭāṅga yoga, royal yoga, royal union, sahaja marg, and classical yoga.","image":"Swami_Vivekananda_1896.jpg.webp","url":"Rāja_yoga"}
