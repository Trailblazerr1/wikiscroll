{"title":"Theater (structure)","summary":"A theater, theatre or playhouse, is a structure where theatrical works or plays are performed, or other performances such as musical concerts may be produced. A theatre used for opera performances is called an opera house. While a theater is not required for performance (as in environmental theater or street theater), a theater serves to define the performance and audience spaces. The facility is traditionally organized to provide support areas for performers, the technical crew and the audience members.","image":"Palais_Garnier._December_5%2C_2010.jpg.webp","url":"Theater_(structure)"}
