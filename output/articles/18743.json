{"title":"Gravy","summary":"Gravy is a sauce, often made from the juices of meats that run naturally during cooking and often thickened with wheat flour or corn starch for added texture. The gravy may be further coloured and flavored with gravy salt (a simple mix of salt and caramel food colouring) or gravy browning (gravy salt dissolved in water) or ready-made cubes and powders can be used as a substitute for natural meat or vegetable extracts. Canned and instant gravies are also available.[1] Gravy is commonly served with biscuits, roasts, meatloaf, rice,[2] noodles, chips(fries) and mashed potatoes.","image":"Sauce_mit_champignons.jpg.webp","url":"Gravy"}
