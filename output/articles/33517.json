{"title":"Oxbow lake","summary":"An oxbow lake is a U-shaped lake that forms when a wide meander of a river is cut off, creating a free-standing body of water.  In south Texas, oxbows left by the Rio Grande are called resacas.  In Australia, oxbow lakes are called billabongs.\nThe word \"oxbow\" can also refer to a U-shaped bend in a river or stream, whether or not it is cut off from the main stream.[1][2]","image":"Nowitna_river.jpg.webp"}
