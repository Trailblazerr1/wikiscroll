{"title":"Amnesiac (album)","summary":"Amnesiac is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 30 May 2001 by EMI subsidiaries Parlophone and Capitol Records. It was recorded with producer Nigel Godrich in the same sessions as Radiohead's previous album Kid A (2000); feeling the work was too dense for a double album, Radiohead released it as two albums. As with Kid A, Amnesiac incorporates influences from electronic music, 20th-century classical music, jazz and krautrock. The final track, \"Life in a Glasshouse\", is a collaboration with jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton and his band.","image":"Radiohead_-_Amnesiac_cover.png.webp"}
