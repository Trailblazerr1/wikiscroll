{"title":"Temporary work","summary":"Temporary work or temporary employment (also called gigs) refers to an employment situation where the working arrangement is limited to a certain period of time based on the needs of the employing organization. Temporary employees are sometimes called \"contractual\", \"seasonal\", \"interim\", \"casual staff\", \"outsourcing\",  \"freelance\"; or the words may be shortened to \"temps\". In some instances, temporary, highly skilled professionals (particularly in the white-collar worker fields, such as human resources, research and development, engineering, and accounting) refer to themselves as consultants. Increasingly, executive-level positions (e.g. CEO, CIO, CFO, CMO, CSO) are also filled with Interim Executives or Fractional Executives.","image":"Beraƒçi_borovnica_0613.jpg.webp"}
