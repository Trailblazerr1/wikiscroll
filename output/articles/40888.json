{"title":"Skellig Michael","summary":"Skellig Michael (Irish: Sceilg Mhichíl [ˌʃcɛlʲɟ ˈvʲɪhiːlʲ]), also called Great Skellig (Irish: Sceilig Mhór [ˈʃcɛlʲɪɟ woːɾˠ]), is a twin-pinnacled crag 11.6 kilometres (7.2 mi) west of the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. The island is named after the archangel Michael, while \"Skellig\" is derived from the Irish language word sceilig, meaning a splinter of stone. Its twin island, Little Skellig (Sceilig Bheag), is smaller and inaccessible (landing is not permitted). The two islands rose c. 374–360 million years ago during a period of mountain formation, along with the MacGillycuddy's Reeks mountain range. Later, they were separated from the mainland by rising water levels.","image":"Skellig_Michael03(js).jpg.webp","url":"Skellig_Michael"}
