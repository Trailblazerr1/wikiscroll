{"title":"Music of the United Kingdom","summary":"Throughout its history, the United Kingdom has been a major producer and source of musical creation, drawing its early artistic basis from church music and the ancient and traditional folk music and instrumentation of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales.  Each of the four countries of the United Kingdom has its own diverse and distinctive folk music forms, which flourished until the era of industrialisation when it began to be replaced by new forms of popular music, including music hall and brass bands. Many British musicians have influenced modern music on a global scale, and the United Kingdom has one of the world's largest music industries. Global music widely developed by British acts include pop, rock, as well as subgenres of the genre; avant-funk, new wave, acid jazz, neo soul, trip hop, dubstep and industrial.[1][2][3]","image":"Proms-albert-hall-04.jpg.webp","url":"Music_of_the_United_Kingdom"}
