{"title":"Cyclotron","summary":"A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator invented by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1929â€“1930 at the University of California, Berkeley,[1][2] and patented in 1932.[3][4] A cyclotron accelerates charged particles outwards from the center of a flat cylindrical vacuum chamber along a spiral path.[5][6] The particles are held to a spiral trajectory by a static magnetic field and accelerated by a rapidly varying (radio frequency) electric field. Lawrence was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physics for this invention.[6][7]","image":"Berkeley_60-inch_cyclotron.jpg.webp"}
