{"title":"Carrauntoohil","summary":"Carrauntoohil or Carrauntoohill (/ˌkærənˈtuːəl/ KARR-ən-TOO-əl; Irish: Corrán Tuathail [ˌkɔɾˠaːn̪ˠ ˈt̪ˠuəhəlʲ], meaning \"Tuathal's sickle\") is the highest mountain on the island of Ireland at 1,038.6 metres (3,407 feet 6 inches). It is on the Iveragh Peninsula in the Reeks District in County Kerry, close to the centre of Ireland's highest mountain range, MacGillycuddy's Reeks. Carrauntoohil is composed mainly of sandstone, whose glaciation produced distinctive features on the mountain such as the Eagle's Nest corrie and some deep gullies and sharp arêtes in its east and northeastern faces that are popular with rock and winter climbers.","image":"Carrauntoohil_2016.JPG.webp","url":"Carrauntoohil"}
