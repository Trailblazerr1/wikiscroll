{"title":"Kolkhoz","summary":"A kolkhoz[lower-alpha 1] (Russian: колхо́з, IPA: [kɐlˈxos] (listen)) was a form of collective farm in the Soviet Union. Kolkhozes existed along with state farms or sovkhoz.[lower-alpha 2] These were the two components of the socialized farm sector that began to emerge in Soviet agriculture after the October Revolution of 1917, as an antithesis both to the feudal structure of impoverished serfdom and aristocratic landlords and to individual or family farming.","image":"Пам.Шевченко_Колхозник_крупно.JPG.webp","url":"Kolkhoz"}
