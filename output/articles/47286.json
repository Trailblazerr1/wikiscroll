{"title":"Veronica Lake","summary":"Veronica Lake (born Constance Frances Marie Ockelman; November 14, 1922[1] – July 7, 1973) was an American film, stage, and television actress. Lake was best known for her  femme fatale roles in film noirs with Alan Ladd during the 1940s and her peek-a-boo hairstyle. By the late 1940s, Lake's career began to decline, due in part to her alcoholism. She made only one film in the 1950s, but made several guest appearances on television. She returned to the big screen in 1966 in the film Footsteps in the Snow (1966), but the role failed to revitalize her career.","image":"Veronica_Lake_Paramount.jpg.webp"}
