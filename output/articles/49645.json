{"title":"β-Carotene","summary":"β-Carotene is an organic, strongly coloured red-orange pigment abundant in fungi,[5] plants, and fruits. It is a member of the carotenes, which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons. Among the carotenes, β-carotene is distinguished by having beta-rings at both ends of the molecule. β-Carotene is biosynthesized from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.[6]","image":"Beta-Carotin.svg.png.webp"}
