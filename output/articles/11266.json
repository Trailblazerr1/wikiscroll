{"title":"Cortisone","summary":"Cortisone is a pregnane (21-carbon) steroid hormone. It is a naturally-occurring corticosteroid metabolite that is also used as a pharmaceutical prodrug; it is not synthesized in the adrenal glands. Cortisol is converted by the action of the enzyme corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 into the inactive metabolite cortisone, particularly in the kidneys. Cortisone is converted back to the active steroid cortisol by the action of the enzyme 11Î²-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, particularly in the liver.","image":"Cortison.svg.png.webp"}
