{"title":"Detergent","summary":"A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleansing properties when in dilute solutions.[1] There are a large variety of detergents, but the most commonly found are alkylbenzene sulfonates: a family of soap-like compounds that are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.","image":"Diskflaskor.JPG.webp"}
