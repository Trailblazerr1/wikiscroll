{"title":"Basic reproduction number","summary":"In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, or basic reproductive number (sometimes called basic reproduction ratio or basic reproductive rate), denoted \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{0}}\n  \n (pronounced R nought or R zero),[1] of an infection is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.[2] The definition assumes that no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination). Some definitions, such as that of the Australian Department of Health, add the absence of \"any deliberate intervention in disease transmission\".[3] The basic reproduction number is not necessarily the same as the effective reproduction number \n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n  \n (usually written \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{t}}\n  \n [t for time], sometimes \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{e}}\n  \n),[4] which is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population, which does not have to be the uninfected state. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          R\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R_{0}}\n  \n is a dimensionless number (persons infected per person infecting) and not a time rate, which would have units of timeâˆ’1,[5] or units of time like doubling time.[6]","image":"9b8916196f182fcbaaca54f931176a4a4f5769cc.svg"}
