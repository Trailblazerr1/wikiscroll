{"title":"Mixing console","summary":"In sound recording and reproduction, and sound reinforcement systems, a mixing console is an electronic device for combining sounds of many different audio signals. Inputs to the console include microphones being used by singers and for picking up acoustic instruments, signals from electric or electronic instruments, or recorded music. Depending on the type, a mixer is able to control analog or digital signals. The modified signals are summed to produce the combined output signals, which can then be broadcast, amplified through a sound reinforcement system or recorded.","image":"SSL_SL9000J_(72ch)_%40_The_Cutting_Room_Recording_Studios%2C_NYC.jpg.webp"}
