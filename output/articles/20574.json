{"title":"History of the Republic of Ireland","summary":"The Irish state came into being in 1919 as the 32 county Irish Republic. In 1922, having seceded from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Treaty, it became the Irish Free State. It comprised 32 counties until 6 counties under the control of Unionists, opted out.  The 1937 constitution renamed the 'Southern Ireland' state 'Ireland'. In 1949, only 26 counties explicitly became a republic under the terms of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, definitively ending its tenuous membership of the British Commonwealth. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the European Communities (EC) as a member state which would later become the European Union (EU).","image":"Atlas_Van_der_Hagen-KW1049B11_048-HIBERNIAE_REGNUM_tam_in_praecipuas_ULTONIAE%2C_CONNACIAE%2C_LAGENIAE%2C_et_MOMONIAE%2C_quam_in_minores_earundem_Provincias%2C_et_Ditiones_subjacentes_peraccurat√©_divisum.jpeg.webp","url":"History_of_the_Republic_of_Ireland"}
