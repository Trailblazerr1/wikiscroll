{"title":"WASH","summary":"WASH (or Watsan, WaSH) is an acronym that stands for \"water, sanitation and hygiene\".  Universal, affordable and sustainable access to WASH is a key public health issue within international development and is the focus of the first two targets of Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6).[2] Targets 6.1 and 6.2 aim at equitable and accessible water and sanitation for all. \"Access to WASH\" includes safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene education. Improving access to WASH services can improve health, life expectancy, student learning, gender equality, and other important issues of international development.[3] This can reduce illness and death, and also affect poverty reduction and socio-economic development.[4] Challenges include providing services to urban slums, improper management of water distribution systems, failures of WASH systems over time, providing equitable access to drinking water supply and gender issues. WASH services have to be provided to household locations but also to  schools, healthcare facilities, work places, markets, prisons, train stations, public locations etc.","image":"Mortality_rate_attributable_to_unsafe_water%2C_sanitation%2C_and_hygiene_(WASH)%2C_OWID.svg.png.webp"}
