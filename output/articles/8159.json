{"title":"Cadherin","summary":"Cadherins (named for \"calcium-dependent adhesion\") are a type of cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that are important in the formation of adherens junctions to allow cells to adhere to each other .[1] Cadherins are a class of type-1 transmembrane proteins, and they are dependent on calcium (Ca2+) ions to function, hence their name. Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular cadherin domains, whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic tail associates with numerous adaptors and signaling proteins, collectively referred as the cadherin adhesome.","image":"Adherens_Junctions_structural_proteins.svg.png.webp","url":"Cadherin"}
