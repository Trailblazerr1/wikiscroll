{"title":"Grime (music genre)","summary":"Grime is a genre of electronic music[3] that emerged in London in the early 2000s. It developed out of the earlier UK dance style UK garage,[4] and draws influences from jungle, dancehall, and hip hop.[2] The style is typified by rapid, syncopated breakbeats, generally around 140 beats per minute,[4][1] and often features an aggressive or jagged electronic sound.[5] Emceeing is a significant element of the style, and lyrics often revolve around gritty depictions of urban life.[6]","image":"RollDeep.jpg.webp"}
