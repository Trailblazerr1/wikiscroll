{"title":"Hooke's law","summary":"Hooke's law is a law of physics that states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distanceâ€”that is, Fs = kx, where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring (i.e., its stiffness), and x is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring. The law is named after 17th-century British physicist Robert Hooke. He first stated the law in 1676 as a Latin anagram.[1][2] He published the solution of his anagram in 1678[3] as: ut tensio, sic vis (\"as the extension, so the force\" or \"the extension is proportional to the force\"). Hooke states in the 1678 work that he was aware of the law since 1660.","image":"Hookes-law-springs.png.webp"}
