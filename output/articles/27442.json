{"title":"Louis Pasteur","summary":"Louis Pasteur ForMemRS (/ˈluːi pæˈstɜːr/, French: [lwi pastœʁ]; 27 December 1822 – 28 September 1895) was a French chemist and microbiologist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation, and pasteurization. His research in chemistry led to remarkable breakthroughs in the understanding of the causes and preventions of diseases, which laid down the foundations of hygiene, public health and much of modern medicine.[7] His works are credited to saving millions of lives through the developments of vaccines for rabies and anthrax. He is regarded as one of the founders of modern bacteriology and has been honoured as the \"father of bacteriology\"[8] and as the \"father of microbiology\"[9][10] (together with Robert Koch,[11][12] and the latter epithet also attributed to Antonie van Leeuwenhoek[13]).","image":"Louis_Pasteur%2C_foto_av_Paul_Nadar%2C_Crisco_edit.jpg.webp"}
