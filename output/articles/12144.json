{"title":"Data breach","summary":"A data breach is a security violation, in which sensitive, protected or confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen or used by an individual unauthorized to do so.[1] Other terms are unintentional information disclosure, data leak, information leakage, and data spill.  Incidents range from concerted attacks by individuals who hack for personal gain or malice (black hats),  organized crime,  political activists or national governments, to poorly configured system security or careless disposal of used computer equipment or data storage media. Leaked information can range from matters compromising national security, to information on actions which a government or official considers embarrassing and wants to conceal. A deliberate data breach by a person privy to the information, typically for political purposes, is more often described as a \"leak\".[2]","image":"Information_Security_Incidents_by_Category%2C_Fiscal_Year_2014.svg.png.webp","url":"Data_breach"}
