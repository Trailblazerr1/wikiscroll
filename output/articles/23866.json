{"title":"Johnstown Flood","summary":"The Johnstown Flood (locally, the Great Flood of 1889) occurred on Friday, May 31, 1889, after the catastrophic failure of the South Fork Dam, located on the south fork of the Little Conemaugh River, 14 miles (23 km) upstream of the town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam ruptured after several days of extremely heavy rainfall, releasing 14.55 million cubic meters of water.[4] With a volumetric flow rate that temporarily equaled the average flow rate of the Mississippi River,[5] the flood killed 2,209 people[6] and accounted for $17 million of damage (about $490 million in 2020 dollars[3]).","image":"Johnstown_flood_debris.jpg.webp","url":"Johnstown_Flood"}
