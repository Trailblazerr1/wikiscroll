{"title":"Tropical Storm Vamei","summary":"Tropical Storm Vamei (also known as Typhoon Vamei) was a Pacific tropical cyclone that formed closer to the equator than any other tropical cyclone on record. The last storm of the 2001 Pacific typhoon season, Vamei developed on 26 December at 1.4° N in the South China Sea. It strengthened quickly and made landfall along extreme southeastern Peninsular Malaysia. Vamei rapidly weakened into a remnant low over Sumatra on 28 December, and the remnants eventually re-organized in the North Indian Ocean. Afterward, the storm encountered strong wind shear once again, and dissipated on 1 January 2002.","image":"Vamei_2001-12-27_0123Z.jpg.webp","url":"Tropical_Storm_Vamei"}
