{"title":"Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act","summary":"The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA or the Kennedy–Kassebaum Act[1][2]) is a United States federal statute enacted by the 104th United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on August 21, 1996. It modernized the flow of healthcare information, stipulates how personally identifiable information maintained by the healthcare and healthcare insurance industries should be protected from fraud and theft, and addressed some limitations on healthcare insurance coverage.[3] It generally prohibits healthcare providers and healthcare businesses, called covered entities, from disclosing protected information to anyone other than a patient and the patient's authorized representatives without their consent. With limited exceptions, it does not restrict patients from receiving information about themselves.[4] It does not prohibit them from voluntarily sharing their health information however they choose, or – if they disclose medical information to family members, friends, or other individuals not a part of a covered entity – legally require them to maintain confidentiality.","image":"Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg.png.webp"}
