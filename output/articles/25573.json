{"title":"Late Devonian extinction","summary":"The Late Devonian extinction consisted of several extinction events in the Late Devonian Epoch, which collectively represent one of five largest mass extinction events in the history of life on Earth. The term primarily refers to a major extinction, the Kellwasser event (also known as the Frasnian-Famennian extinction), which occurred around 372 million years ago, at the boundary between the Frasnian stage and the Famennian stage, the last stage in the Devonian Period.[1][2] Overall, 19% of all families and 50% of all genera became extinct.[3] A second mass extinction, the Hangenberg event (also known as the end-Devonian extinction), occurred 359 million years ago, bringing an end to the Famennian and Devonian, as the world transitioned into the Carboniferous Period.[4]","image":"Extinction_intensity.svg.png.webp"}
