He was born in the then-Danish peninsula of Scania, which became part of Sweden the century afterwards. Tycho was well known in his lifetime as an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist. He has been described as \"the first competent mind in modern astronomy to feel ardently the passion for exact empirical facts\".[3] Most of his observations were more accurate than the best available observations at the time.","image":"Tycho_Brahe.JPG.webp"}
