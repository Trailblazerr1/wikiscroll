{"title":"Hotspot (geology)","summary":"In geology, hotspots (or hot spots) are volcanic locales thought to be fed by underlying mantle that is anomalously hot compared with the surrounding mantle.[1] Examples include the Hawaii, Iceland and Yellowstone hotspots. A hotspot's position on the Earth's surface is independent of tectonic plate boundaries, and so hotspots may create a chain of volcanoes as the plates move above them.","image":"Hotspot(geology)-1.svg.png.webp","url":"Hotspot_(geology)"}
