{"title":"August 2013 Rabaa massacre","summary":"On 14 August 2013, Egyptian police and army forces under the command of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi raided two camps of protesters in Cairo: one at al-Nahda Square and a larger one at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square. The two sites had been occupied by supporters of President Mohamed Morsi, who had been removed from office by the military a month earlier in the 2013 Egyptian coup d'Ã©tat. The camps were raided after initiatives to end the six-week sit-ins by peaceful means failed and as a result of the raids, the camps were cleared out within hours.[10] The raids were described by Human Rights Watch as crimes against humanity and \"one of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history\".[11] According to Human Rights Watch, a minimum of 904 people were killed (at least 817 in Rabaa Square and at least 87 in al-Nahda Square) with strong evidence to suggest more likely at least 1,000 died during the dispersal.[12] However, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry, 595 civilians and 43 police officers were killed and at least 3,994 were injured.[8][13][14] Later, the official Forensic Medical Authority stated only 8 police officers were killed[15] and Egypt's National Council for Human Rights stated at least 624 civilians were killed.[6] The Muslim Brotherhood and the National Coalition for Supporting Legitimacy stated the number of deaths from the Rabaa al-Adawiya Mosque sit-in alone was about 2,600.[9][16] The total casualty count made 14 August the deadliest day in Egypt since the 2011 Egyptian revolution which had toppled former President Hosni Mubarak.[17] Several world leaders denounced the violence during the sit-in dispersals.[18][19]","image":"Rabaa_al-Adawiya.png.webp"}
