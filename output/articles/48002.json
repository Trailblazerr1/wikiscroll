{"title":"Waste-to-energy","summary":"Waste-to-energy (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) is the process of generating energy in the form of electricity and/or heat from the primary treatment of waste, or the processing of waste into a fuel source. WtE is a form of energy recovery. Most WtE processes generate electricity and/or heat directly through combustion, or produce a combustible fuel commodity, such as methane, methanol, ethanol or synthetic fuels.[1]","image":"District_heating_plant_spittelau_ssw_crop1.png.webp","url":"Waste-to-energy"}
