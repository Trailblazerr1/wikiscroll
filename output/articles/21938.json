{"title":"Infant baptism","summary":"Infant baptism[1][2] is the practice of baptising infants or young children. Infant baptism can be contrasted with what is called \"believer's baptism\" (or credobaptism, from the Latin word credo meaning \"I believe\"), which is the religious practice of baptising only individuals who personally confess faith in Jesus, therefore excluding underage children. Infant baptism is also called christening by some faith traditions.[3]","image":"InfantBaptism.jpg.webp","url":"Infant_baptism"}
