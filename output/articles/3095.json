{"title":"Alternation of generations","summary":"Alternation of generations (also known as metagenesis or heterogenesis)[1] is the type of life cycle that occurs in those plants and algae in the Archaeplastida and the Heterokontophyta that have distinct haploid sexual and diploid asexual stages.  In these groups, a multicellular haploid gametophyte with n chromosomes alternates with a multicellular diploid sporophyte with 2n chromosomes, made up of n pairs. A mature sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis, a process which reduces the number of chromosomes to half, from 2n to n.","image":"Alternation_of_generations_simpler.svg.png.webp","url":"Alternation_of_generations"}
