{"title":"Taxi","summary":"A taxi, also known as a cab or a taxicab, is a type of vehicle for hire with a driver, used by a single passenger or small group of passengers, often for a non-shared ride. A taxicab conveys passengers between locations of their choice. This differs from public transport where the pick-up and drop-off locations are decided by the service provider, not by the customers, although demand responsive transport and share taxis provide a hybrid bus/taxi mode.","image":"Cabs.jpg.webp","url":"Taxi"}
