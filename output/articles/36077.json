{"title":"Prince William, Duke of Cumberland","summary":"Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, KG, KB, FRS (15 April 1721 [N.S.] â€“ 31 October 1765) was the third and youngest son of King George II of Great Britain and Ireland and his wife,\nCaroline of Ansbach. He was Duke of Cumberland from 1726. He is best remembered for his role in putting down the Jacobite Rising at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which made him immensely popular throughout parts of Britain.[1][2] He is often referred to by the nickname given to him by his Tory opponents: 'Butcher' Cumberland.[3][4] Despite his triumph at Culloden, he had a largely unsuccessful military career. Between 1748 and 1755 he attempted to enact a series of army reforms that were resisted by the opposition and by the army itself.[5] Following the Convention of Klosterzeven in 1757, he never again held active military command and switched his attentions to politics and horse racing.","image":"Cumberland-Reynolds.jpg.webp"}
