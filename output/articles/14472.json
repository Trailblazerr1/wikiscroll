{"title":"Electron transport chain","summary":"The electron transport chain (ETC; respiratory chain[1]) is a series of protein complexes that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions (both reduction and oxidation occurring simultaneously) and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H+ ions) across a membrane. The electron transport chain is built up of peptides, enzymes, and other molecules.","image":"Mitochondrial_electron_transport_chainâ€”Etc4.svg.png.webp","url":"Electron_transport_chain"}
