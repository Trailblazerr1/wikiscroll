{"title":"Battle royale game","summary":"A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that blends last-man-standing gameplay with the survival, exploration and scavenging elements of a survival game. Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \"safe area\" or \"safe zone\", with the winner being the last player or team alive.","image":"Vg_icon.svg.png.webp"}
