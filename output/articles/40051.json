{"title":"Sept","summary":"A sept is a division of a family, especially of a Scottish or Irish family.[1] The term is used in both Scotland and Ireland, where it may be translated as sliocht, meaning \"progeny\" or \"seed\",[2] which may indicate the descendants of a person (for example, Sliocht Bhriain Mhic Dhiarmada, \"the descendant of Brian MacDermott\"). The word may derive from the Latin saeptum, meaning \"enclosure\" or \"fold\",[3] or via an alteration of \"sect\".[4]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Sept"}
