{"title":"Circumflex","summary":"The circumflex is a diacritic in the Latin and Greek scripts that is used in the written forms of many languages and in various romanization and transcription schemes. It received its English name from Latin: circumflexus \"bent around\"—a translation of the Greek: περισπωμένη (perispōménē). The circumflex in the Latin script is chevron-shaped (ˆ), while the Greek circumflex may be displayed either like a tilde (˜) or like an inverted breve ( ̑ ).","image":"27_Y_Parêd.jpg.webp","url":"Circumflex"}
