{"title":"Intertidal zone","summary":"The intertidal zone, also known as the foreshore or seashore, is the area above water level at low tide and underwater at high tide (in other words, the area within the tidal range). This area can include several types of habitats with various species of life, such as seastars, sea urchins, and many species of coral.[1] Sometimes it is referred to as the littoral zone, although that can be defined as a wider region.","image":"Bancao_Beach_at_Low_Tide_showing_Intertidal_Zone_from_about_200_meters_from_the_beach.jpg.webp","url":"Intertidal_zone"}
