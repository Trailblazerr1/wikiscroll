{"title":"List of regions of Canada","summary":"The list of regions of Canada is a summary of geographical areas on a hierarchy that ranges from national (groups of provinces and territories) at the top to local regions and sub-regions of provinces at the bottom.  Administrative regions that rank below a province and above a municipality are also included if they have a comprehensive range of functions compared to the limited functions of specialized government agencies.  Some provinces and groups of provinces are also quasi-administrative regions at the federal level for purposes such as representation in the Senate of Canada.  However regional municipalities (or regional districts in British Columbia) are included with local municipalities in the article List of municipalities in Canada.","image":"Maple_Leaf_(from_roundel).svg.png.webp"}
