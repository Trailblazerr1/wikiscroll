{"title":"Suspension (chemistry)","summary":"In chemistry, a suspension is a heterogeneous mixture of a fluid that contains solid particles sufficiently large for sedimentation. The particles may be visible to the naked eye, usually must be larger than one micrometer, and will eventually settle, although the mixture is only classified as a suspension when and while the particles have not settled out.","image":"WaterAndFlourSuspensionLiquid.jpg.webp"}
