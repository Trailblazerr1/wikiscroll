{"title":"Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)","summary":"Bedtime Stories is the sixth studio album by American singer Madonna. It was released on October 25, 1994, by Maverick and Sire Records. In order to move into a more mainstream sound, Madonna collaborated with Dallas Austin, Babyface, Dave Hall and Nellee Hooper, wanting to soften her image following the critical and commercial backlash she faced after releasing sexually explicit projects in the previous two years, notably the Erotica album, the Sex book and her leading role in the erotic thriller Body of Evidence. This image transformation was preceded by the ballad \"I'll Remember\" from the soundtrack to the 1994 film With Honors.","image":"Bedtime_Stories_Madonna.png.webp","url":"Bedtime_Stories_(Madonna_album)"}
