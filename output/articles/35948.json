{"title":"Press pass","summary":"A press pass (alternatively referred to as a press card or a journalist pass) grants some type of special privilege to journalists.  Some cards have recognized legal status; others merely indicate that the bearer is a practicing journalist.  The nature of the benefits is determined by the type of issuing agency, of which there are three major categories: news organizations, law-enforcement agencies, and event organizers (usually for a specific single affair like a corporate press conference).  Each type of card grants different authorizations, thus it is often necessary or desirable for reporters to hold multiple press passes simultaneously.[1]","image":"MRpresspass.jpg.webp"}
