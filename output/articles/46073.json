{"title":"Trump administration family separation policy","summary":"The United States family separation policy under the Trump administration was presented to the public as a \"zero tolerance\" approach intended to deter illegal immigration and to encourage tougher legislation.[1] It was officially adopted across the entire USâ€“Mexico border from April 2018 until June 2018.[2] Under the policy, federal authorities separated children and infants from parents or guardians with whom they had entered the US.[3][4][5] The adults were prosecuted and held in federal jails or deported, and the children were placed under the supervision of the US Department of Health and Human Services.[3] A 2021 review done by the Biden administration found that more than 1,400 parents were ultimately deported without their children. In January 2020 the SPLC reported that the official government number of children separated from their parents or guardians under the policy was 4,368.[6] [7]","image":"Ursula_(detention_center)_1.png.webp","url":"Trump_administration_family_separation_policy"}
