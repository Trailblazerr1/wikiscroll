{"title":"Subaru World Rally Team","summary":"The Subaru World Rally Team (SWRT) was Subaru's World Rally Championship (WRC) team. It used a distinctive blue with yellow colour scheme that is a throwback to the sponsorship deal with State Express 555, a BAT cigarette brand popular in Asia.[2] 555 logos were found on Subaru cars from 1993 to 2003,[2] although less prevalent since 1999 due to BAT's participation in Formula One with British American Racing. Subaru's WRC efforts date back to 1980, however, the team, in its current form, has existed since 1989, when the British firm Prodrive took over its operations, and its base moved from Japan to Banbury, England.[2][3]","image":"Subaru_World_Rally_Team_logo.svg.png.webp"}
