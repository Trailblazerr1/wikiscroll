{"title":"Cardiopulmonary bypass","summary":"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a technique in which a machine temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lungs during surgery, maintaining the circulation of blood and the oxygen content of the patient's body. The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a heartâ€“lung machine or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by perfusionists.  CPB is a form of extracorporeal circulation. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is generally used for longer-term treatment.","image":"Coronary_artery_bypass_surgery_Image_657C-PH.jpg.webp","url":"Cardiopulmonary_bypass"}
