Over the previous three years, Bowie had garnered massive artistic success with the \"Berlin Trilogy\", which consisted of Low, \"Heroes\" and Lodger (1977â€“1979). However, the trilogy had proven less successful commercially. By 1980, numerous artists Bowie had inspired with the trilogy were out-performing him commercially, leading him to desire a more commercial sound for his next record.","image":"DavidBowieScaryMonstersCover.jpg.webp","url":"Scary_Monsters_(and_Super_Creeps)"}
