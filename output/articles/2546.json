{"title":"Al-Azhar Mosque","summary":"Al-Azhar Mosque (Arabic: الجامع الأزهر‎, romanized: al-Jāmiʿ al-ʾAzhar, lit. 'The Resplendent Congregational Mosque'), known simply in Egypt as al-Azhar, is an Egyptian mosque in Islamic Cairo. Jawhar al-Siqilli  commissioned its construction for the newly established capital city in 970. Its name is usually thought to derive from az-Zahrāʾ (meaning \"the shining one\"), a title given to Fatimah bent Muhammad, the Prophet of Islam. It was the first mosque established in Cairo, a city that has since gained the nickname \"the City of a Thousand Minarets\".[lower-alpha 2]","image":"Cairo_-_Islamic_district_-_Al_Azhar_Mosque_and_University.JPG.webp","url":"Al-Azhar_Mosque"}
