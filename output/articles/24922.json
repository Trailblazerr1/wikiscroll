{"title":"Kitáb-i-Aqdas","summary":"The Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Persian: کتاب اقدس‎), or simply Aqdas (Persian: اقدس‎) is the central religious text of the Baháʼí Faith written by Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the religion, in 1873.[1] Though it is the main source of Baháʼí laws and practices, much of the content deals with other matters, like foundational principles of the religion, the establishment of Baháʼí institutions, mysticism, ethics, social principles, and prophecies. In Baha'i literature it is described as \"the Mother-Book\" of the Baháʼí teachings, and the \"Charter of the future world civilization\".[2]","image":"Bahai_star.svg.png.webp"}
