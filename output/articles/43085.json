{"title":"Symbiogenesis","summary":"Symbiogenesis, endosymbiotic theory, or serial endosymbiotic theory,[1] is the leading evolutionary theory of the origin of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic organisms.[2] The theory holds that mitochondria, plastids such as chloroplasts, and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells are descended from formerly free-living prokaryotes (more closely related to bacteria than to archaea) taken one inside the other in endosymbiosis. The idea that chloroplasts were originally independent organisms that merged into a symbiotic relationship with other one-celled organisms dates back to the 19th century, when it was espoused by researchers such as Andreas Schimper.","image":"Mitochondrion_186.jpg.webp"}
