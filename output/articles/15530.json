{"title":"Exploration of Jupiter","summary":"The exploration of Jupiter has been conducted via close observations by automated spacecraft. It began with the arrival of Pioneer 10 into the Jovian system in 1973, and, as of 2016, has continued with eight further spacecraft missions.  All of these missions were undertaken by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and all but two were flybys taking detailed observations without landing or entering orbit.  These probes make Jupiter the most visited of the Solar System's outer planets as all missions to the outer Solar System have used Jupiter flybys.  On 5 July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbitâ€”the second craft ever to do so.  Sending a craft to Jupiter is difficult, mostly due to large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment.","image":"Portrait_of_Jupiter_from_Cassini.jpg.webp","url":"Exploration_of_Jupiter"}
