{"title":"Cittern","summary":"The cittern or cithren (Fr. cistre, It. cetra, Ger. Cister, Sp. cistro, cedra, c√≠tola)[1] is a stringed instrument dating from the Renaissance. Modern scholars debate its exact history, but it is generally accepted that it is descended from the Medieval citole (or cytole). Its flat-back design was simpler and cheaper to construct than the lute. It was also easier to play, smaller, less delicate and more portable. Played by people of all social classes, the cittern was a premier instrument of casual music-making much as is the guitar today.","image":"MuseuMusicaBCN_8845.jpg.webp","url":"Cittern"}
