{"title":"African wolf","summary":"The African wolf (Canis lupaster)[1][3] is a canine native to North Africa, West Africa, the Sahel, northern East Africa, and the Horn of Africa. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.[1] In the Atlas Mountains, it was sighted in elevations as high as 1,800 m (5,900 ft).[4] It is primarily a predator, targeting invertebrates and mammals as large as gazelle fawns, though larger animals are sometimes taken. Its diet also includes animal carcasses, human refuse, and fruit. The African wolf is a monogamous and territorial species; offspring remain with the family to assist in raising their parents' younger pups.[5]","image":"Golden_wolf_small.jpg.webp","url":"African_wolf"}
