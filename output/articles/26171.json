{"title":"Lilith","summary":"Lilith (/ˈlɪlɪθ/; Hebrew: לִילִית‎, romanized: Līlīṯ) is a demonic figure in Judaic mythology, supposedly the primordial she-demon and alternatively first wife of Adam.[1] She is presumed to be mentioned in Biblical Hebrew in the Book of Isaiah,[2] and later in Late Antiquity in Mandaean Gnosticism mythology and Jewish mythology sources from 500 CE onwards. Lilith appears in historiolas (incantations incorporating a short mythic story) in various concepts and localities[3] that give partial descriptions of her. She is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (Eruvin 100b, Niddah 24b, Shabbat 151b, Baba Bathra 73a), in the Book of Adam and Eve as Adam's first wife, and in the Zohar Leviticus 19a as \"a hot fiery female who first cohabited with man\".[4]","image":"Lilith_(John_Collier_painting).jpg.webp"}
