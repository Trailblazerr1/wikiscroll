{"title":"Continental collision","summary":"In geology, continental collision is a phenomenon of plate tectonics that occurs at convergent boundaries. Continental collision is a variation on the fundamental process of subduction, whereby the subduction zone is destroyed, mountains produced, and two continents sutured together. Continental collision is only known to occur on Earth.","image":"Continental-continental_convergence_Fig21contcont.gif"}
