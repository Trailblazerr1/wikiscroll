{"title":"Larsen Ice Shelf","summary":"The Larsen Ice Shelf is a long ice shelf in the northwest part of the Weddell Sea, extending along the east coast of the Antarctic Peninsula[1] from Cape Longing to Smith Peninsula. It is named after Captain Carl Anton Larsen, the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel Jason, who sailed along the ice front as far as 68Â°10' South during December 1893.[2] In finer detail, the Larsen Ice Shelf is a series of shelves that occupy (or occupied) distinct embayments along the coast. From north to south, the segments are called Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B, and Larsen C (the largest) by researchers who work in the area.[3]  Further south, Larsen D and the much smaller Larsen E, F and G are also named.[4]","image":"Antarctic-Peninsula-Ice-Shelves.png.webp","url":"Larsen_Ice_Shelf"}
