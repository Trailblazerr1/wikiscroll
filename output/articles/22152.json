{"title":"Internal carotid artery","summary":"The internal carotid artery (Latin: arteria carotis interna) is located in the inner side of the neck in contrast to the external carotid artery.[1] In human anatomy, they arise from the common carotid arteries, where these bifurcate into the internal and external carotid arteries at cervical vertebrae C3 or C4; the internal carotid artery supplies the brain, including the eyes,[2] while the external carotid nourishes other portions of the head, such as the face, the scalp, the skull, and the meninges.","image":"Blausen_0170_CarotidArteries.png.webp"}
