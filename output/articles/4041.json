{"title":"Aortic dissection","summary":"Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when an injury to the innermost layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart.[3] In most cases, this is associated with a sudden onset of severe chest or back pain, often described as \"tearing\" in character.[1][2] Also, vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may occur.[2] Other symptoms may result from decreased blood supply to other organs, such as stroke or mesenteric ischemia.[2] Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from insufficient blood flow to the heart or complete rupture of the aorta.[2]","image":"AoDissekt_scheme_StanfordB_en.png.webp","url":"Aortic_dissection"}
