{"title":"Kiln","summary":"A kiln is a thermally insulated chamber, a type of oven, that produces temperatures sufficient to complete some process, such as hardening, drying, or chemical changes.  Kilns have been used for millennia to turn objects made from clay into pottery, tiles and bricks. Various industries use rotary kilns for pyroprocessingâ€”to calcinate ores, to calcinate limestone to lime for cement, and to transform many other materials.","image":"Charcoal_Kilns%2C_California.JPG.webp"}
