{"title":"Konstantin Päts","summary":"Konstantin Päts (Estonian pronunciation: [ˈkons.tɑnʲ.tin ˈpætʲs]; 23 February [O.S. 11 February] 1874[1] – 18 January 1956) was the most influential politician of interwar Estonia, and served five times as the country's head of government. He was one of the first Estonians to become active in politics and started an almost 40-year political rivalry with Jaan Tõnisson, first through journalism with his newspaper Teataja, later through politics. He was condemned to death during the 1905 Revolution, but managed to flee first to Switzerland, then to Finland, where he continued his literary work. He returned to Estonia, but had to spend time in prison in 1910–1911.","image":"Konstantin_Päts.jpg.webp"}
