{"title":"Volunteering","summary":"Volunteering is a voluntary act of an individual or group freely giving time and labour for community service.[1][2] Many volunteers are specifically trained in the areas they work, such as medicine, education, or emergency rescue. Others serve on an as-needed basis, such as in response to a natural disaster. Nowadays, one common type of volunteer is volunteer tourism.","image":"CI_boardwalk_Sandy_sweepers_jeh.jpg.webp"}
