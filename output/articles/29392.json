{"title":"Mercury dime","summary":"The Mercury dime is a ten-cent coin struck by the United States Mint from late 1916 to 1945.  Designed by Adolph Weinman and also referred to as the Winged Liberty Head dime, it gained its common name because the obverse depiction of a young Liberty, identifiable by her winged Phrygian cap, was confused with the Roman god Mercury.  Weinman is believed to have used Elsie Stevens, the wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens, as a model.  The coin's reverse depicts a fasces, symbolizing unity and strength, and an olive branch, signifying peace.","image":"1943D_Mercury_Dime_obverse-cutout.png.webp","url":"Mercury_dime"}
