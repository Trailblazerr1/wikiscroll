{"title":"Roald Dahl bibliography","summary":"Roald Dahl (1916â€“1990) was a British author and scriptwriter,[1] and \"the most popular writer of children's books since Enid Blyton\", according to Philip Howard, the literary editor of The Times.[2] He was raised by his Norwegian mother, who took him on annual trips to Norway, where she told him the stories of trolls and witches present in the dark Scandinavian fables. Dahl was influenced by the stories, and returned to many of the themes in his children's books.[3] His mother also nurtured a passion in the young Dahl for reading and literature.[4]","image":"Roald_Dahl.jpg.webp"}
