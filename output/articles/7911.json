{"title":"Burgomaster","summary":"Burgomaster (alternatively spelled burgermeister, literally \"master of the town, master of the borough, master of the fortress, master of the citizens\") is the English form of various terms in or derived from Germanic languages for the chief magistrate or executive of a city or town. The name in English was derived from the Dutch burgemeester. In some cases, Burgomaster was the title of the head of state and head of government of a sovereign (or partially or de facto sovereign) city-state, sometimes combined with other titles, such as Hamburg's First Mayor and President of the Senate). Contemporary titles are commonly translated into English as mayor.","image":"'The_Burgomaster's_Family'%2C_Dutch_oil_on_canvas_painting%2C_c._1640%2C_Honolulu_Academy_of_Arts.jpg.webp"}
