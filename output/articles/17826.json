{"title":"George Orwell bibliography","summary":"The bibliography of George Orwell includes journalism, essays, novels and non-fiction books written by the British writer Eric Blair (1903â€“1950), either under his own name or, more usually, under his pen name George Orwell. Orwell was a prolific writer on topics related to contemporary English society and literary criticism, who has been declared \"perhaps the 20th century's best chronicler of English culture.\"[1] His non-fiction cultural and political criticism constitutes the majority of his work, but Orwell also wrote in several genres of fictional literature.","image":"George_Orwell_press_photo.jpg.webp"}
