{"title":"David I of Scotland","summary":"David I or Dauíd mac Maíl Choluim (Modern: Daibhidh I mac [Mhaoil] Chaluim;[1] c. 1084 – 24 May 1153) was a 12th-century ruler who was Prince of the Cumbrians from 1113 to 1124 and later King of Scotland from 1124 to 1153. The youngest son of Malcolm III and Margaret of Wessex, David spent most of his childhood in Scotland, but was exiled to England temporarily in 1093. Perhaps after 1100, he became a dependent at the court of King Henry I. There he was influenced by the Anglo-French culture of the court.","image":"Malcolm_IV%2C_King_of_Scotland%2C_charter_to_Kelso_Abbey%2C_1159%2C_initial_(crop_David_I).jpg.webp"}
