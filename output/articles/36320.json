{"title":"Protestantism","summary":"Protestantism   is a form of Christianity that originated with the 16th-century Reformation,[lower-alpha 1] a movement against what its followers perceived to be errors in the Catholic Church.[1] Protestants originating in the Reformation reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy, but disagree among themselves regarding the number of sacraments, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and matters of ecclesiastical polity and apostolic succession.[2][3] They emphasize the priesthood of all believers; justification by faith alone (sola fide) rather than by faith with good works; the teaching that salvation comes by divine grace or \"unmerited favor\" only, not as something merited (sola gratia); and either affirm the Bible as being the sole highest authority (sola scriptura \"scripture alone\") or primary authority (prima scriptura \"scripture first\") for Christian doctrine, rather than being on parity with sacred tradition.[4][5] The five solae of Lutheran and Reformed Christianity summarise basic theological differences in opposition to the Catholic Church.[6][4]","image":"Lutherstadt_Wittenberg_09-2016_photo06.jpg.webp","url":"Protestantism"}
