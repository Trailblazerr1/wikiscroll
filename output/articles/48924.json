{"title":"World Series of Poker","summary":"The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is a series of poker tournaments[1] held annually in Las Vegas and, since 2004, sponsored by Caesars Entertainment. It dates its origins to 1970, when Benny Binion invited seven of the best-known poker players to the Horseshoe Casino for a single tournament, with a set start and stop time, and a winner determined by a secret ballot of the seven players.[2]","image":"Poker_current_event.svg.png.webp"}
