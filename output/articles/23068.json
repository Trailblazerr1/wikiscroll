{"title":"Japanese name","summary":"Japanese names (日本人の氏名、日本人の姓名、日本人の名前, Nihonjin no Shimei, Nihonjin no Seimei, Nihonjin no Namae) in modern times consist of a family name (surname) followed by a given name, in that order. Nevertheless, when a Japanese name is written in the Roman alphabet, ever since the Meiji era, the official policy has been to cater to Western expectations and reverse the order. As of 2019, the government has stated its intention to change this policy.[2] Japanese names are usually written in kanji, which are characters that are Chinese in origin but Japanese in pronunciation. The pronunciation of kanji Japanese names follows a special set of rules. Parents also have the option of using hiragana or katakana when giving a birth name to their newborn child. Names written in hiragana or katakana are phonetic renderings, and so lack the visual meaning of names expressed in the logographic kanji.","image":"Yamada-vertical.svg.png.webp","url":"Japanese_name"}
