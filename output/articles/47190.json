{"title":"Vector (mathematics and physics)","summary":"In mathematics and physics, a vector is an element of a vector space. For many specific vector spaces, the vectors have received specific names, which are listed below. In general, a Euclidean vector is a geometric object with both length and direction (and so is frequently represented as a ray). Such vectors can be added to each other or scaled using vector algebra. Correspondingly, an ensemble of vectors is called a vector space. These objects are the subject of linear algebra and can be characterized by their dimension.","image":"Vector_from_A_to_B.svg.png.webp","url":"Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)"}
