{"title":"Mary: A Fiction","summary":"Mary: A Fiction is the only complete novel by 18th-century British feminist Mary Wollstonecraft. It tells the tragic story of a female's successive \"romantic friendships\"[1] with a woman and a man. Composed while Wollstonecraft was a governess in Ireland, the novel was published in 1788 shortly after her summary dismissal and her decision to embark on a writing career, a precarious and disreputable profession for women in 18th-century Britain.[2]","image":"WollstonecraftMaryFiction.jpg.webp","url":"Mary:_A_Fiction"}
