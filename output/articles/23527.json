{"title":"Joe Perry (American football)","summary":"Fletcher Joseph Perry (January 22, 1927 â€“ April 25, 2011) was a professional American football fullback in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL). He played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1948 to 1960, the Baltimore Colts from 1961 to 1962, and returned to the 49ers in 1963 for his final year in football. He was exceptionally fast, a trait uncommon for a fullback and one which earned him the nickname, \"the Jet\". The first African-American to be named the NFL Most Valuable Player, he became one of American football's first black stars.","image":"Perry_1954_Bowman.jpg.webp","url":"Joe_Perry_(American_football)"}
