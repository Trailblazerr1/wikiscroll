{"title":"Qurban (Islamic ritual sacrifice)","summary":"Qurban (Arabic: قربان‎), less commonly spelled Korban and known as Qurbani throughout Southeast Asia, is the ritual animal sacrifice of a livestock animal during a specified time of Eid al-Adha.[1][2] The concept and definition of the word is derived from the Qur'an, the sacred scripture of Muslims, and is the analog of korban in Judaism. While the word and concept are similar as in other Abrahamic religions, there is notably an opposition of the burnt offering,[3] with the spoils of the sacrifice being distributed as food to the impoverished and family of the one making the offering for consumption.","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp","url":"Qurban_(Islamic_ritual_sacrifice)"}
