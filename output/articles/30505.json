{"title":"Moral hazard","summary":"In economics, moral hazard occurs when an entity has an incentive to increase its exposure to risk because it does not bear the full costs of that risk. For example, when a corporation is insured, it may take on higher risk knowing that its insurance will pay the associated costs. A moral hazard may occur where the actions of the risk-taking party change to the detriment of the cost-bearing party after a financial transaction has taken place.","image":"Solidus-Constantius_Gallus-thessalonica_RIC_149.jpg.webp"}
