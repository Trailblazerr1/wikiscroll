{"title":"Frock coat","summary":"A frock coat is a formal men's coat characterised by a knee-length skirt cut all around the base just above the knee, popular during the Victorian and Edwardian periods (1820sâ€“1920s). It is a fitted, long-sleeved coat with a centre vent at the back and some features unusual in post-Victorian dress.  These include the reverse collar and lapels, where the outer edge of the lapel is often cut from a separate piece of cloth from the main body and also a high degree of waist suppression around the waistcoat, where the coat's diameter round the waist is less than round the chest. This is achieved by a high horizontal waist seam with side bodies, which are extra panels of fabric above the waist used to pull in the naturally cylindrical drape. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding was rare or minimal.","image":"Frock_Coat_April_1904.jpg.webp","url":"Frock_coat"}
