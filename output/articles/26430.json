{"title":"List of Formula One Grands Prix","summary":"Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing series managed by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name alludes to a series of FIA rules to which all participants and vehicles are required to conform.[1][2] The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races around the world, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] Each Grand Prix meeting occurs over three days with either two or three practice sessions before a three-part qualifying session on either Friday or Saturday to set the starting order for Saturday's sprint qualifying session (to set the race's final starting positions) or Sunday's race.[4][5] Grands Prix are frequently named after the country, region or city in which they are raced,[6] and in some seasons, nations have hosted more than one event.[7] Should F1 hold two or more races in the same nation in the same year, either on a different circuit or the same one, then their Grand Prix names will be different.[8] The results of each Grand Prix held over the course of the season are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.[9]","image":"Formula_1_all_over_the_world-2021.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_Formula_One_Grands_Prix"}
