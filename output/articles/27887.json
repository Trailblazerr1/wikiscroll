{"title":"Maclura pomifera","summary":"Maclura pomifera, commonly known as the Osage orange, horse apple, hedge, or hedge apple tree, is a small deciduous tree or large shrub, typically growing about 8 to 15 metres (30–50 ft) tall. The distinctive fruit, a multiple fruit, is roughly spherical, bumpy, 8 to 15 centimetres (3–6 in) in diameter, and turns bright yellow-green in the fall. The fruits secrete a sticky white latex when cut or damaged. Despite the name \"Osage orange\",[3] it is not related to the orange.[4] It is a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae.[5] Due to its latex secretions and woody pulp, the fruit is typically not eaten by humans and rarely by foraging animals, giving it distinction as an anachronistic \"ghost of evolution\".[6]","image":"Maclura_pomifera2.jpg.webp","url":"Maclura_pomifera"}
