{"title":"Fluoroscopy","summary":"Fluoroscopy (/flʊəˈrɒskəpi/[1]) is an imaging technique that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving images of the interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope (/ˈflʊərəskoʊp/)[2][3] allows a physician to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched. This is useful for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery.","image":"Fluoroscope.jpg.webp"}
