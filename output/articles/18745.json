{"title":"Gray's Inn","summary":"The Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, commonly known as Gray's Inn, is one of the four Inns of Court (professional associations for barristers and judges) in London. To be called to the bar in order to practise as a barrister in England and Wales, an individual must belong to one of these inns. Located at the intersection of High Holborn and Gray's Inn Road in Central London, the Inn is a professional body and provides office and some residential accommodation for barristers. It is ruled by a governing council called \"Pension\", made up of the Masters of the Bench (or \"benchers\"), and led by the Treasurer, who is elected to serve a one-year term. The Inn is known for its gardens (the “Walks”), which have existed since at least 1597.","image":"Gray's_inn_zz.JPG.webp"}
