{"title":"Light novel","summary":"A light novel (ライトノベル, raito noberu) is a style of Japanese young adult novel primarily targeting high school and middle school students.[1][2] The term \"light novel\" is a wasei-eigo, or a Japanese term formed from words in the English language. Light novels are often called ranobe (ラノベ)[3] or, in English, LN. The average length of a light novel is about 50,000 words,[4] close to the minimum expected for a Western novel,[5] and they are usually published in bunkobon size (A6, 10.5 cm × 14.8 cm), often with dense publishing schedules.","image":"Light_Novel_Bookstore_in_Macau.jpg.webp","url":"Light_novel"}
