{"title":"Neighbours","summary":"Neighbours is an Australian television soap opera that was first broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It was created by television executive Reg Watson. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's earlier soap Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, beginning where the previous series left off, and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest-running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame.","image":"Neighbours_Title_Card.png.webp","url":"Neighbours"}
