{"title":"Major depressive disorder","summary":"Major depressive disorder (MDD), also known simply as depression, is a mental disorder[9] characterized by at least two weeks of pervasive low mood, low self-esteem, and loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. Those affected may also occasionally have delusions or hallucinations.[1] Introduced by a group of US clinicians in the mid-1970s,[10] the term was adopted by the American Psychiatric Association for this symptom cluster under mood disorders in the 1980 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) classification, and has become widely used since.","image":"Van_Gogh_-_Trauernder_alter_Mann.jpeg.webp","url":"Major_depressive_disorder"}
