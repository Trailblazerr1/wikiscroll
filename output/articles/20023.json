{"title":"Hemorrhoid","summary":"Hemorrhoids (or haemorrhoids), also known as piles, are vascular structures in the anal canal.[7][8] In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control.[2] They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term \"hemorrhoid\" is often used to refer to the disease.[8] The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present.[4] Internal hemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating.[3][4] External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus.[4] If bleeding occurs it is usually darker.[4] Symptoms frequently get better after a few days.[3] A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.[4]","image":"Internal_and_external_hemorrhoids.png.webp"}
