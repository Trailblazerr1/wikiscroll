{"title":"Sallekhana","summary":"Sallekhana (IAST: sallekhanƒÅ), also known as samlehna, santhara,  samadhi-marana or sanyasana-marana,[1] is a supplementary vow to the ethical code of conduct of Jainism. It is the religious practice of voluntarily fasting to death by gradually reducing the intake of food and liquids.[2] It is viewed in Jainism as the thinning of human passions and the body,[3] and another means of destroying rebirth-influencing karma by withdrawing all physical and mental activities.[2] It is not considered as a suicide by Jain scholars because it is not an act of passion, nor does it employ poisons or weapons.[2] After the sallekhana vow, the ritual preparation and practice can extend into years.[1]","image":"Nishidhi_stone_with_14th_century_Old_Kannada_inscription_from_Tavanandi_forest.JPG.webp","url":"A%2fSallekhana"}
