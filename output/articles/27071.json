{"title":"Literature","summary":"Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry.[2] In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed.[3] Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment, and  can also have a social, psychological, spiritual, or political role.","image":"Pinocchio.jpg.webp"}
