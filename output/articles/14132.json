{"title":"Economy of the Han dynasty","summary":"The economy of Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD) of ancient China experienced upward and downward movements in its economic cycle, periods of economic prosperity and decline. It is normally divided into three periods: Western Han (206 BC – 9 AD), the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD), and Eastern Han (25–220 AD). The Xin regime, established by the former regent Wang Mang, formed a brief interregnum between lengthy periods of Han rule. Following the fall of Wang Mang, the Han capital was moved eastward from Chang'an to Luoyang. In consequence, historians have named the succeeding eras Western Han and Eastern Han respectively.[1]","image":"Covered_Jade_Cup_with_Gilt_Bronze_Fitting%2C_2nd_-_1st_century_BC%2C_Western_Han_period%2C_China_-_Sackler_Museum_-_DSC02596.JPG.webp"}
