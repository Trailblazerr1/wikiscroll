{"title":"Cephalopod","summary":"A cephalopod /ˈsɛfələpɒd/ is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda /sɛfəˈlɒpədə/ (Greek plural κεφαλόποδες, kephalópodes; \"head-feet\")[3] such as a squid, octopus, cuttlefish, or nautilus. These exclusively marine animals are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head, and a set of arms or tentacles (muscular hydrostats) modified from the рrimitive molluscan foot. Fishers sometimes call cephalopods \"inkfish\", referring to their common ability to squirt ink. The study of cephalopods is a branch of malacology known as teuthology.","image":"Cephalopoda_diversity.jpg.webp"}
