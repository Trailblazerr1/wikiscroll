{"title":"50 euro note","summary":"The fifty euro note (€50) is one of the middle value euro banknotes and has been used since the introduction of the euro (in its cash form) in 2002.[6] The note is used by some 343 million Europeans and in the 23 countries which have the euro as their sole currency (with 22 legally adopting it). In May 2021, there were about 13,073,000,000 fifty euro banknotes in circulation in the eurozone. It is by far the most widely circulated denomination, accounting for almost half (48.6%) of the total banknotes.[7] Estimates suggest that the average life of a fifty euro banknote is about four years before it is replaced due to wear.[8]","image":"The_Europa_series_50_€_obverse_side.png.webp","url":"50_euro_note"}
