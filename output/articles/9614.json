{"title":"Chicxulub crater","summary":"The Chicxulub crater (IPA: [tʃikʃuˈlub]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.[3] Its center is offshore near the communities of Chicxulub Puerto and Chicxulub Pueblo, after which the crater is named.[4] It was formed when a large asteroid, about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in diameter, struck the Earth.[5] The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (commonly known as the \"K–Pg boundary\"), slightly more than 66 million years ago,[2] and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs.","image":"Yucatan_chix_crater.jpg.webp","url":"Chicxulub_crater"}
