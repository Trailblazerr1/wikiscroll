{"title":"Oliver Mowat","summary":"Sir Oliver Mowat, GCMG PC QC (July 22, 1820 â€“ April 19, 1903) was a Canadian lawyer, politician, and Liberal Party leader. He served for nearly 24 years as the third premier of Ontario. He was the eighth lieutenant governor of Ontario and one of the Fathers of Confederation. He is best known for defending successfully the constitutional rights of the provinces in the face of the centralizing tendency of the national government as represented by his longtime conservative adversary, John A. Macdonald. This longevity and power was due to his political maneuvering, in terms of building a political base around Liberals, Catholics, trade unions, and anti-French-Canadian sentiment.[1]","image":"Oliver_Mowat.jpg.webp","url":"Oliver_Mowat"}
