{"title":"Blouse","summary":"A blouse (/blaʊz, blaʊs, bluːz/)[1] is a loose-fitting upper garment that was worn by workmen, peasants, artists, women, and children.[2][3]  It is typically gathered at the waist or hips (by tight hem, pleats, parter, or belt) so that it hangs loosely (\"blouses\"[4]) over the wearer's body.[3]  Today, the word most commonly refers to a girl's or woman's dress shirt.[5] It can also refer to a man's shirt if it is a loose-fitting style (e.g. poet shirts and Cossack shirts),[2][6] though it rarely is. Traditionally, the term has been used to refer to a shirt which blouses out or has an unmistakably feminine appearance.","image":"Striped_Bow_Neck_Blouse_and_a_Navy_Blue_Mini_Skirt_(18966025833).jpg.webp"}
