{"title":"Near East","summary":"The Near East (Arabic: الشرق الأدنى‎, romanized: al-Sharq al-'Adnā, Hebrew: המזרח הקרוב‎, Aramaic: ܕܢܚܐ ܩܪܒ‎, Persian: خاور نزدیک‎, romanized: Xāvar-e nazdik, Turkish: Yakın Doğu) is a geographical term which roughly encompasses a transcontinental region in Western Asia, that was once the historical Fertile Crescent, and later the Levant section of the Roman and Byzantine empires. It comprises Turkey (both Anatolia and East Thrace), and Egypt (mostly located in North Africa, with the Sinai Peninsula being in Asia). Despite having varying definitions within different academic circles, the term was originally applied to the maximum extent of the Ottoman Empire. The term has fallen into disuse in the English language and has been replaced by the term Middle East, which includes Egypt, Western Asia and the South Caucasus.","image":"Near_East_topographic_map-blank.svg.png.webp"}
