{"title":"Political status of Puerto Rico","summary":"The political status of Puerto Rico is that of an unincorporated territory of the United States. As such, the island of Puerto Rico is neither a sovereign nation nor a U.S. state. Because of that ambiguity, the territory, as a polity, lacks certain rights but enjoys certain benefits that other polities have or lack. For instance, in contrast to U.S. states, Puerto Rico residents cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections nor can they elect their own senators and representatives to the U.S. Congress. On the other hand, in contrast to U.S. states, only some residents of Puerto Rico are subject to federal income taxes.[lower-alpha 1] The political status of the island thus stems from how different Puerto Rico is politically from sovereign nations and from U.S. states.","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_the_Commonwealth_of_Puerto_Rico.svg.png.webp","url":"Political_status_of_Puerto_Rico"}
