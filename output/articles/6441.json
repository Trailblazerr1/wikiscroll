{"title":"Bias of an estimator","summary":"In statistics, the bias (or bias function) of an estimator is the difference between this estimator's expected value and the true value of the parameter being estimated. An estimator or decision rule with zero bias is called unbiased. In statistics, \"bias\" is an objective property of an estimator. Bias can also be measured with respect to the median, rather than the mean (expected value), in which case one distinguishes median-unbiased from the usual mean-unbiasedness property. Bias is a distinct concept from consistency. Consistent estimators converge in probability to the true value of the parameter, but may be biased or unbiased; see bias versus consistency for more.","image":"cf0c92a2f9f331565f351f716b59a2d1167eebbf.svg","url":"Bias_of_an_estimator"}
