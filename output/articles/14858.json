{"title":"English country house","summary":"An English country house is a large house or mansion in the English countryside. Such houses were often owned by individuals who also owned a town house. This allowed them to spend time in the country and in the cityâ€”hence, for these people, the term distinguished between town and country. However, the term also encompasses houses that were, and often still are, the full-time residence for the landed gentry that ruled rural Britain until the Reform Act 1832.[1] Frequently, the formal business of the counties was transacted in these country houses, having functional antecedents in manor houses.","image":"Ham_House_(7776599228).jpg.webp","url":"English_country_house"}
