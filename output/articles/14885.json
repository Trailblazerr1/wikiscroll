{"title":"Enosis","summary":"Enosis (Greek: Ένωσις, IPA: [ˈenosis], \"union\") is the movement of various Greek communities that live outside Greece for incorporation of the regions that they inhabit into the Greek state. The idea is related to the Megali Idea, an irredentist concept of a Greek state that dominated Greek politics following the creation of modern Greece in 1830. The Megali Idea called for the annexation of all ethnic Greek lands, parts of which had participated in the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s but were unsuccessful and so remained under foreign rule.","image":"Cypriot_demonstration_1930.jpg.webp","url":"Enosis"}
