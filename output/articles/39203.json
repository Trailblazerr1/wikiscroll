{"title":"Samarkand","summary":"Samarkand (/ˈsæmərkænd/; Uzbek: Samarqand, pronounced [samarqand, –qant]; Tajik: Самарқанд; Persian: سمرقند‎), also known as Samarqand, is a city in southeastern Uzbekistan and among the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Central Asia. There is evidence of human activity in the area of the city from the late Paleolithic Era, though there is no direct evidence of when Samarkand was founded; several theories propose that it was founded between the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. Prospering from its location on the Silk Road between China and Europe, at times Samarkand was one of the largest[2] cities of Central Asia.[3] Most of the inhabitants of this city are Persian-speaking and speak the Tajik Persian dialect. This city is one of the historical centers of the Tajik people in Central Asia, which in the past was one of the important cities of the great empires of Iran.[4][5]","image":"Registan_Samarkand_Timurid_Renaissance.jpg.webp"}
