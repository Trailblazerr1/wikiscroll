{"title":"Namaste","summary":"Namaste (/ˈnʌməsteɪ/,[1] Devanagari: नमस्ते, Sanskrit pronunciation: [nɐmɐst̪eː] (listen)), sometimes spoken as namaskar and namaskaram, is a Hindu[2][3][4] customary, non-contact form of  respectfully greeting and honoring the opposite person or group, used at any time of day.[5] Today, it is found on the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, among the Indian diaspora and elswhere. The gesture (but not the term namaste for it) is widely used as a greeting in the parts of Southeast Asia where Indian religions are strong.[6][7] Namaste is usually spoken with a slight bow and hands pressed together, palms touching and fingers pointing upwards, thumbs close to the chest. This gesture is called añjali mudrā; the standing posture incorporating it is pranamasana.[8]","image":"An_Oberoi_Hotel_employee_doing_Namaste%2C_New_Delhi.jpg.webp","url":"Namaste"}
