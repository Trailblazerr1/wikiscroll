{"title":"Shakespearean history","summary":"In the First Folio, the plays of William Shakespeare were grouped into three categories: comedies, histories, and tragedies.  The histories—along with those of contemporary Renaissance playwrights—help define the genre of history plays.[1] The Shakespearean histories are biographies of English kings of the previous four centuries and include the standalones King John, Edward III and Henry VIII as well as a continuous sequence of eight plays.  These last are considered to have been composed in two cycles. The so-called first tetralogy, apparently written in the early 1590s, covers the Wars of the Roses saga and includes Henry VI, Parts I, II & III and Richard III. The second tetralogy, finished in 1599 and including Richard II, Henry IV, Parts I & II and Henry V, is frequently called the Henriad after its protagonist Prince Hal, the future Henry V.","image":"First_Folio%2C_Shakespeare_-_0322.jpg.webp","url":"Shakespearean_history"}
