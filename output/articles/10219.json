{"title":"Clause","summary":"In language, a clause is a constituent that links a semantic predicand (expressed or not) and a semantic predicate.[1] A typical clause consists of a subject and a syntactic predicate,[2] the latter typically a verb phrase, a verb with any objects and other modifiers. However, the subject is sometimes not said or explicit, often the case in null-subject languages if the subject is retrievable from context, but it sometimes also occurs  in other languages such as English (as in imperative sentences and non-finite clauses).","image":"Clause_trees_1'.png.webp"}
