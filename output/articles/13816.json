{"title":"Dutch elm disease","summary":"Dutch elm disease (DED) is caused by a member of the sac fungi (Ascomycota) affecting elm trees, and is spread by elm bark beetles. Although believed to be originally native to Asia, the disease was accidentally introduced into America and Europe, where it has devastated native populations of elms that did not have resistance to the disease. It has also reached New Zealand. The name \"Dutch elm disease\" refers to its identification in 1921 and later in the Netherlands by Dutch phytopathologists Bea Schwarz and Christine Buisman, who both worked with professor Johanna Westerdijk.[1][2] The disease affects species in the genera Ulmus and Zelkova; therefore it is not specific to the Dutch elm hybrid.[3][4][5]","image":"Iepziekte_op_goudiep_(Ophiostoma_ulmi_on_Ulmus_hollandica_'Wredei'_4_May_2009).jpg.webp"}
