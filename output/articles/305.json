{"title":"1996 Manchester bombing","summary":"The 1996 Manchester bombing was an attack carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) on Saturday 15 June 1996. The IRA detonated a 1,500-kilogram (3,300 lb) lorry bomb on Corporation Street in the centre of Manchester, England. It was the biggest bomb detonated in Great Britain since the Second World War.[2] It targeted the city's infrastructure and economy and caused significant damage, estimated by insurers at £700 million (equivalent to £1.3 billion in 2020), a sum surpassed only by the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, also by the IRA, and the 2001 September 11 attacks.[3]","image":"BBC_picture_Arndale_centre_after_1996_bomb.jpg.webp","url":"1996_Manchester_bombing"}
