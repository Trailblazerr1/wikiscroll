{"title":"Godsmack discography","summary":"Godsmack is an American rock band founded in 1995 by singer Sully Erna and bassist Robbie Merrill. The band has released seven studio albums, one EP, two compilations, three video albums, and thirty-one singles. Erna and Merrill recruited local friend and guitarist Lee Richards and drummer Tommy Stewart to complete the band's lineup.[1] In 1996, Tony Rombola replaced Richards, as the band's guitarist.[2] In 1998, Godsmack released their self-titled debut album, a remastered version of the All Wound Up demo.[3] The album was distributed by Universal/Republic Records and shipped four million copies in the United States. In 2001, the band contributed the track \"Why\" to the Any Given Sunday soundtrack. After two years of touring, the band released Awake. Although the album was a commercial success, it failed to match the sales of Godsmack.[4] In 2002, Stewart left the band due to personal differences, and was replaced by Shannon Larkin.[5]","image":"Godsmack.jpg.webp"}
