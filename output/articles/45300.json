{"title":"Titanium tetrachloride","summary":"Titanium tetrachloride is the inorganic compound with the formula TiCl4. It is an important intermediate in the production of titanium metal and the pigment titanium dioxide. TiCl4 is a volatile liquid. Upon contact with humid air, it forms spectacular opaque clouds of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and hydrated hydrogen chloride. It is sometimes referred to as \"tickle\" or \"tickle 4\" due to the phonetic resemblance of its molecular formula (TiCl4) to the word.[7][8]","image":"Titanium-tetrachloride-3D-vdW.png.webp"}
