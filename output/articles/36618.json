{"title":"Pálinka","summary":"Pálinka (Hungarian: stamesz / stampedli) is a traditional fruit spirit (or fruit brandy) in Eastern and Central Europe with origins in Hungary, more exactly  known under several names, and invented in the Middle Ages. Protected as a geographical indication of the European Union, only fruit spirits mashed, distilled, matured and bottled in Hungary, and similar apricot spirits from four provinces of Austria can be called \"pálinka\", while \"Tótpálinka\" refers to wheat-derived beverages. Törkölypálinka, a different product in the legal sense, is a similarly protected pomace spirit that is commonly included with pálinka. While pálinka may be made of any locally grown fruit, the most common ones are plums, apricots, apples, pears, and cherries.[1]","image":"Sopron_barack_07.JPG.webp"}
