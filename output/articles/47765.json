{"title":"Vulture","summary":"A vulture is a bird of prey that scavenges on carrion. There are 23 extant species of vulture (including Condors).[2] Old World vultures include 16 living species native to Europe, Africa, and Asia; New World vultures are restricted to North and South America and consist of seven identified species, all belonging to the Cathartidae family[2][3]\nA particular characteristic of many vultures is a bald, unfeathered head. This bare skin is thought to keep the head clean when feeding, and also plays an important role in thermoregulation.[4]","image":"Bartgeier_Gypaetus_barbatus_front_Richard_Bartz.jpg.webp"}
