{"title":"Year 2038 problem","summary":"The Year 2038 problem (also called Y2038, Epochalypse,[1][2] Y2K38, Y2038 error, Y2K38 superbug or Unix Y2K) relates to representing time in many digital systems as the number of seconds passed since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and storing it as a signed 32-bit integer. Such implementations cannot encode times after 03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038. Similar to the Y2K problem, the Year 2038 problem is caused by an insufficient number of bits (digits) chosen to represent time.","image":"Year_2038_problem.gif"}
