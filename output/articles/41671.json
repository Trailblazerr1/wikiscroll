{"title":"Specific impulse","summary":"Specific impulse (usually abbreviated Isp) is a measure of how efficiently a reaction mass engine (a rocket using propellant or a jet engine using fuel) creates thrust. For engines whose reaction mass is only the fuel they carry, specific impulse is exactly proportional to exhaust gas velocity.","image":"41bae943b77f591d8b298ee431cc3b8736b58589.svg","url":"Specific_impulse"}
