{"title":"Intangible cultural heritage","summary":"An intangible cultural heritage (ICH) is a practice, representation, expression, knowledge, or skill considered by UNESCO to be part of a place's cultural heritage. Buildings, historic places, monuments, and artifacts are cultural property. Intangible heritage consists of nonphysical intellectual wealth, such as folklore, customs, beliefs, traditions, knowledge, and language. Intangible cultural heritage is considered by member states of UNESCO in relation to the tangible World Heritage focusing on intangible aspects of culture. In 2001, UNESCO made a survey[1] among States and NGOs to try to agree on a definition, and the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage[2] was drafted in 2003 for its protection and promotion.","image":"UNESCO-ICH-blue.svg.png.webp","url":"Intangible_cultural_heritage"}
