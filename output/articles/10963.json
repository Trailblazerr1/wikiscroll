{"title":"Conservatism","summary":"Conservatism is an aesthetic, cultural, social, and political philosophy, which seeks to promote and to preserve traditional social institutions.[1] The central tenets of conservatism may vary in relation to the traditional values or practices of the culture and civilization in which it appears.
