{"title":"Conscience","summary":"Conscience is a cognitive process that elicits emotion and rational associations based on an individual's moral philosophy or value system. Conscience stands in contrast to elicited emotion or thought due to associations based on immediate sensory perceptions and reflexive responses, as in sympathetic central nervous system responses.  In common terms, conscience is often described as leading to feelings of remorse when a person commits an act that conflicts with their moral values.  The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based on reason has occasioned debate through much of modern history between theories of basics in ethic of human life in juxtaposition to the theories of romanticism and other reactionary movements after the end of the Middle Ages.","image":"Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_022.jpg.webp"}
