{"title":"Biological carbon fixation","summary":"Biological carbon fixation or —Åarbon assimilation is the process by which inorganic carbon (particularly in the form of carbon dioxide) is converted to organic compounds by living organisms.[1] The compounds are then used to store energy and as structure for other biomolecules. Carbon is primarily fixed through photosynthesis, but some organisms use a process called chemosynthesis in the absence of sunlight.","image":"20100422_235222_Cyanobacteria.jpg.webp","url":"Biological_carbon_fixation"}
