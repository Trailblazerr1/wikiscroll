{"title":"Anode","summary":"An anode is an electrode through which the conventional current enters into a polarized electrical device.  This contrasts with a cathode, an electrode through which conventional current leaves an electrical device.  A common mnemonic is ACID, for \"anode current into device\".[1] The direction of conventional current (the flow of positive charges) in a circuit is opposite to the direction of electron flow, so (negatively charged) electrons flow out the anode of a galvanic cell, into an outside or external circuit connected to the cell. In both a galvanic cell and an electrolytic cell, the anode is the electrode at which the oxidation reaction occurs.","image":"Zinc_anode_2.svg.png.webp"}
