{"title":"Democratic Action Party","summary":"The Democratic Action Party (abbreviation: DAP; Malay: Parti Tindakan Demokratik‬; Chinese: 民主行动党; Tamil: ஜனநாயக செயல் கட்சி), is a major centre-left Malaysian political party which advocates social democracy and secularism.[3] One of the component parties of the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, it was an opposition party for 51 years until PH won the 2018 Malaysian general election and formed the federal government. However, before the coalition finished its first term, defections from partnering PH component parties caused it to lose power after 22 months, culminating in the 2020 Malaysian political crisis. As of 24 February 2020, DAP is the largest party in Malaysia's Dewan Rakyat.","image":"Democratic_Action_Party_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
