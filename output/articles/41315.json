{"title":"Somatic symptom disorder","summary":"A somatic symptom disorder, formerly known as a somatoform disorder,[1][2][3] is any mental disorder that manifests as physical symptoms that suggest illness or injury, but cannot be explained fully by a general medical condition or by the direct effect of a substance, and are not attributable to another mental disorder (e.g., panic disorder).[4] Somatic symptom disorders, as a group, are included in a number of diagnostic schemes of mental illness, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. (Before DSM-5 this disorder was split into somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder.)","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Somatic_symptom_disorder"}
