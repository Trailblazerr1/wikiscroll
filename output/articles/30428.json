{"title":"Monsters in Dungeons & Dragons","summary":"In the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, \"monsters\" are generally the antagonists which players must fight and defeat to progress in the game. Since the game's first edition in 1974, a bestiary was included along other game manuals, first called Monsters & Treasure and now commonly called the Monster Manual. Described as an \"essential\" part of Dungeons & Dragons, the game's monsters have become notable in their own right, influencing fields such as video games and fiction, as well as popular culture.[1]","image":"DnD_Gnoll.png.webp","url":"Monsters_in_Dungeons_&_Dragons"}
