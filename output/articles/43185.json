{"title":"Søren Kierkegaard","summary":"Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (/ˈsɒrən ˈkɪərkəɡɑːrd/ SORR-ən KEER-kə-gard, US also /-ɡɔːr/ -⁠gor, Danish: [ˈsœːɐ̯n̩ ˈɔˀˌpy ˈkʰiɐ̯kəˌkɒˀ] (listen);[7] 5 May 1813 – 11 November 1855[8]) was a Danish theologian, philosopher, poet, social critic, and religious author who is widely considered to be the first existentialist philosopher.[9][10] He wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christendom, morality, ethics, psychology, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a \"single individual\", giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment.[11] He was against literary critics who defined idealist intellectuals and philosophers of his time, and thought that Swedenborg,[12] Hegel,[13] Fichte, Schelling, Schlegel, and Hans Christian Andersen were all \"understood\" far too quickly by \"scholars\".[14]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
