Struck in two varieties, the coins were designed by United States Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber.  The pieces were issued to commemorate the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held in 1904 in St. Louis; one variety depicted former president Thomas Jefferson, and the other, the recently assassinated president William McKinley. Although not the first American commemorative coins, they were the first in gold.","image":"Louisiana_Purchase_Jefferson_dollar_obverse.jpg.webp"}
