{"title":"Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory","summary":"The Brønsted–Lowry theory (also called proton theory of acids and bases[1]) is an acid–base reaction theory which was proposed independently by Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry in 1923.[2][3] The fundamental concept of this theory is that when an acid and a base react with each other, the acid forms its conjugate base, and the base forms its conjugate acid by exchange of a proton (the hydrogen cation, or H+). This theory is a generalization of the Arrhenius theory.","image":"Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png.webp"}
