{"title":"Animal slaughter","summary":"Animal slaughter is the killing of  animals, usually referring to killing domestic livestock. It is estimated that each year 77 billion land animals are slaughtered for food.[2] In general, the animals would be killed for food; however, they might also be slaughtered for other reasons such as being diseased and unsuitable for consumption. The slaughter involves some initial cutting, opening the major body cavities to remove the entrails and offal but usually leaving the carcass in one piece. Such dressing can be done by hunters in the field (field dressing of game) or in a slaughterhouse. Later, the carcass is usually butchered into smaller cuts.","image":"The_Butcher_and_his_Servant_drawn_and_engraved_by_J_Amman_Sixteenth_Century.png.webp"}
