{"title":"Linebacker","summary":"A linebacker (LB or backer) is a playing position in gridiron football.  Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and line up approximately three to five yards (4 m) behind the line of scrimmage and behind the defensive linemen.  They represent the \"middle ground\" of defenders, playing closer to the line of scrimmage than do the defensive backs (or secondary), but further back than do the defensive linemen.","image":"Football-Formation-LB.svg.png.webp"}
