{"title":"Peacock bass","summary":"Peacock bass (or Brazilian tucunaré) (Cichla) is a genus of large cichlids,[3][4] diurnal and predatory freshwater fish native to the Amazon and Orinoco basins, as well as rivers of the Guianas, in tropical South America.[2] They are sometimes referred to in English by their Brazilian name tucunaré or their Spanish name pavon.[4] Despite the common name and their superficial similarity, they are not closely related to other fish known as bass, such as the North American largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).[5][6]","image":"Cichla_ocellaris_Dvur_zoo_1.jpg.webp"}
