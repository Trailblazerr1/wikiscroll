{"title":"2012 Delhi gang rape and murder","summary":"The 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South West Delhi. The incident took place when  Jyoti Singh, a 22-year-old female physiotherapy intern, was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured in a private bus in which she was travelling with her male friend. There were six others in the bus, including the driver, all of whom raped the woman and beat her friend. Eleven days after the assault she was transferred to a hospital in Singapore for emergency treatment but died two days later.[4][5] The incident generated widespread national and international coverage and was widely condemned, both in India and abroad.  Subsequently, public protests against the state and central governments for failing to provide adequate security for women took place in New Delhi, where thousands of protesters clashed with security forces.  Similar protests took place in major cities throughout the country.  Since Indian law does not allow the press to publish a rape victim's name, the victim was widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning \"fearless\", and her struggle and death became a symbol of women's resistance to rape around the world.[6][7]","image":"Silent_Protest_at_India_Gate.jpg.webp","url":"2012_Delhi_gang_rape_and_murder"}
