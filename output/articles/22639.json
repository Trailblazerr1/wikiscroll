{"title":"Itch","summary":"Itch (also known as pruritus) is a sensation that causes the desire or reflex to scratch.[1] Itch has resisted many attempts to be classified as any one type of sensory experience. Itch has many similarities to pain, and while both are unpleasant sensory experiences, their behavioral response patterns are different. Pain creates a withdrawal reflex, whereas itch leads to a scratch reflex.[2]","image":"Itch.jpg.webp","url":"Itch"}
