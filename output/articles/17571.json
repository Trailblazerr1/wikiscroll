{"title":"Gemara","summary":"The Gemara (also transliterated Gemarah, or in Ashkenazi pronunciation Gemore;  from Aramaic גמרא‎, from the Hebrew verb gamar, to finish or complete) is the component of the Talmud comprising rabbinical analysis of and commentary on the Mishnah. At first, Gemara was only spoken of in oral terms and was forbidden to be written down, however after the Mishnah was published by Judah the Prince (c. 200 CE), the work was studied exhaustively by generation after generation of rabbis in Babylonia and the Land of Israel.[1] Their discussions were written down in a series of books that became the Gemara, which when combined with the Mishnah constituted the Talmud.","image":"Adolf_Behrman_-_Talmudysci.jpg.webp"}
