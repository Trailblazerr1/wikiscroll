{"title":"Himiko","summary":"Himiko (卑弥呼, c. 170–248 AD), also known as Shingi Waō (親魏倭王, \"Ruler of Wa, Friend of Wei\"),[1][lower-alpha 1][lower-alpha 2] was a shamaness-queen of Yamatai-koku in Wakoku (倭国). Early Chinese dynastic histories chronicle tributary relations between Queen Himiko and the Cao Wei Kingdom (220–265) and record that the Yayoi period people chose her as ruler following decades of warfare among the kings of Wa. Early Japanese histories do not mention Himiko, but historians associate her with legendary figures such as Empress Consort Jingū, who was regent (c. 200–269) in roughly the same era as Himiko.","image":"Queen-Himiko-Museum-Yayoi-Culture.png.webp","url":"Himiko"}
