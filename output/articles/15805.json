{"title":"Faraday effect","summary":"The Faraday effect or Faraday rotation, sometimes referred to as the magneto-optic Faraday effect (MOFE),[1] is a physical magneto-optical phenomenon. The Faraday effect causes a polarization rotation which is proportional to the projection of the magnetic field along the direction of the light propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal.[2]","image":"Faraday_photograph_ii.jpg.webp"}
