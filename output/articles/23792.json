{"title":"John Smoltz","summary":"John Andrew Smoltz (born May 15, 1967), nicknamed \"Smoltzie\"[1] and \"Marmaduke,\"[2] is an American former baseball pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1988 to 2009, all but the last year with the Atlanta Braves. An eight-time All-Star, Smoltz was part of a celebrated trio of starting pitchers, along with Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, who propelled Atlanta to perennial pennant contention in the 1990s, highlighted by a championship in the 1995 World Series. He won the National League (NL) Cy Young Award in 1996 after posting a record of 24â€“8, equaling the most victories by an NL pitcher since 1972. Though predominantly known as a starter, Smoltz was converted to a reliever in 2001 after his recovery from Tommy John surgery, and spent four years as the team's closer before returning to a starting role. In 2002, he set a National League record with 55 saves and became only the second pitcher in history (joining Dennis Eckersley) to record both a 20-win season and a 50-save season. He is the only pitcher in Major League history to record both 200 wins and 150 saves.","image":"Hall_of_Famer_John_Smoltz_speaks_to_reporters_before_the_MLBPAA's_2016_Legends_for_Youth_Dinner_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"John_Smoltz"}
