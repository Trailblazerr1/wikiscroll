{"title":"Analytic–synthetic distinction","summary":"The analytic–synthetic distinction is a semantic distinction, used primarily in philosophy to distinguish between propositions (in particular, statements that are affirmative subject–predicate judgments) that are of two types: analytic propositions and synthetic propositions. Analytic propositions are true or not true solely by virtue of their meaning, whereas synthetic propositions' truth, if any, derives from how their meaning relates to the world.[1]","image":"Immanuel_Kant_(painted_portrait).jpg.webp","url":"Analytic–synthetic_distinction"}
