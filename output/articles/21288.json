{"title":"Hypergeometric distribution","summary":"In probability theory and statistics, the hypergeometric distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n that contains exactly \n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n  \n objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure. In contrast, the binomial distribution describes the probability of \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n successes in \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n draws with replacement.","image":"c3c9a2c7b599b37105512c5d570edc034056dd40.svg"}
