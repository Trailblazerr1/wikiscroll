{"title":"Blue Movie","summary":"Blue Movie (stylized as blue movie; also known as Fuck[4][5]) is a 1969 American film written, produced, and directed by Andy Warhol.[1][6] It is the first adult erotic film depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical release in the United States,[1][4][6] and is regarded as a seminal film in the Golden Age of Porn (1969â€“1984). It helped inaugurate the \"porno chic\"[7][8] phenomenon, in which porn was publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope)[8] and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert),[9][10] in modern American culture, and later, in many other countries throughout the world.[11][12] According to Warhol, Blue Movie was a major influence in the making of Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film starring Marlon Brando and released a few years after Blue Movie was made.[4] Viva and Louis Waldon, playing themselves, starred in Blue Movie.[4]","image":"BlueMovie.jpg.webp","url":"Blue_Movie"}
