{"title":"Cosmological constant","summary":"In cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: Î›), alternatively called Einstein's cosmological constant, \nis the constant coefficient of a term Albert Einstein temporarily added to his field equations of general relativity.  He later removed it.  Much later it was revived and reinterpreted as the energy density of space, or vacuum energy, that arises in quantum mechanics. It is closely associated with the concept of dark energy.[1]","image":"CMB_Timeline300_no_WMAP.jpg.webp"}
