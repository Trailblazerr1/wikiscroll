{"title":"What's My Line?","summary":"What's My Line? was a panel game show that originally ran in the United States on the CBS Television Network from 1950 to 1967, originally in black and white and later in color, with subsequent U.S. revivals. The game uses celebrity panelists to question contestants in order to determine their occupation, i.e. \"line of work\", with panelists being called on to question and identify a weekly celebrity \"mystery guest\" while blindfolded. It is on the list of longest-running U.S. primetime network television game-shows. Originally moderated by John Charles Daly and with regular panelists Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, and Bennett Cerf, What's My Line? won three Emmy Awards for \"Best Quiz or Audience Participation Show\" in 1952, 1953, and 1958 and the Golden Globe Awards for Best TV Show in 1962.[1][2]","image":"What's_My_Line%3F_logo_screenshot.jpg.webp"}
