{"title":"Gautama Buddha","summary":"Gautama Buddha, popularly known as the Buddha  or Lord Buddha (also known as Siddhattha Gotama or Siddhārtha Gautama[note 3] or Buddha Shakyamuni), was an ascetic, a religious leader and teacher who lived in ancient India (c. 6th to 5th century BCE or c. 5th to 4th century BCE).[5][6][7][note 4] He is regarded as the founder of the world religion of Buddhism, and revered by Buddhists as an enlightened being,[8] who rediscovered an ancient path to freedom from ignorance, craving and the cycle of rebirth and suffering. He taught for around 45 years and built a large following, both monastic and lay.[9] His teaching is based on his insight into the arising of suffering or dissatisfaction and its ending—the state called Nirvana (lit. vanishing or extinguishing).","image":"Buddha_in_Sarnath_Museum_(Dhammajak_Mutra).jpg.webp"}
