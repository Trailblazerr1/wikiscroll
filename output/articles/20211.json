{"title":"Herpetology","summary":"Herpetology (from Greek ἑρπετόν herpetón, meaning \"reptile\" or \"creeping animal\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras).[1] Birds, which are cladistically included within Reptilia, are traditionally excluded here; the scientific study of birds is the subject of ornithology.","image":"Bufo_periglenes2.jpg.webp","url":"Herpetology"}
