{"title":"Mount Hood","summary":"Mount Hood is a potentially active stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. It was formed by a subduction zone on the Pacific coast and rests in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is located about 50 miles (80Â km) east-southeast of Portland, on the border between Clackamas and Hood River counties. In addition to being Oregon's highest mountain, it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence, and it offers the only year-round lift-served skiing in North America.","image":"Mount_Hood_reflected_in_Mirror_Lake%2C_Oregon.jpg.webp","url":"Mount_Hood"}
