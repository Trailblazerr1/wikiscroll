{"title":"Generation X","summary":"Generation X (or Gen X for short) is the demographic cohort following the baby boomers and preceding the millennials. Researchers and popular media use the mid-to-late 1960s as starting birth years and the late 1970s to early 1980s as ending birth years, with the generation being generally defined as people born from 1965 to 1980.[1] By this definition and U.S. Census data, there are 65.2 million Gen Xers[2] in the United States as of 2019.[3] Most members of Generation X are the children of the Silent Generation and early boomers;[4][5] Xers are also often the parents of millennials[4] and Generation Z.[6]","image":"Generation_timeline.svg.png.webp"}
