{"title":"Camera","summary":"A camera is an optical instrument that captures a visual image. At a basic level, cameras are sealed boxes (the camera body) with a small hole (the aperture) that allows light through to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (usually photographic film or a digital sensor). Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface. Lenses focus the light entering the camera, and the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed. A shutter mechanism determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to light.","image":"LEI0440_Leica_IIIf_chrom_-_Sn._580566_1951-52-M39_Blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf-.jpg.webp","url":"Camera"}
