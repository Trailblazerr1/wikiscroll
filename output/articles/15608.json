{"title":"FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives","summary":"The FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives is a most wanted list maintained by the United States's Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The list arose from a conversation held in late 1949 between J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, and William Kinsey Hutchinson,[1] International News Service (the predecessor of the United Press International) editor-in-chief, who were discussing ways to promote capture of the FBI's \"toughest guys\". This discussion turned into a published article, which received so much positive publicity that on March 14, 1950, the FBI officially announced the list to increase law enforcement's ability to capture dangerous fugitives.[2] The first person added to the list was Thomas J. Holden, a robber and member of the Holdenâ€“Keating Gang on the day of the list's inception.[3][1]","image":"Leslie_Ibsen_Rogge_1973_from_Nish_Publishing_Company.jpg.webp","url":"FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives"}
