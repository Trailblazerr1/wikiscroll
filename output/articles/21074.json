{"title":"Humility","summary":"Humility is the quality of being humble.[1] Dictionary definitions accentuate humility as a low self-regard[2] and sense of unworthiness.[3] In a religious context humility can mean a recognition of self in relation to a deity (i.e. God) or deities, and subsequent submission to said deity as a member of that religion.[4][5] Outside of a religious context, humility is defined as being \"unselved\", a liberation from consciousness of self, a form of temperance that is neither having pride (or haughtiness) nor indulging in self-deprecation.[6][7]","image":"Rochdale_Unitarian_Church_\"Humility\".jpg.webp","url":"Humility"}
