{"title":"Igbo people","summary":"The Igbo people (English: /ˈiːboʊ/ EE-boh,[14][15] also US: /ˈɪɡboʊ/;[16][17] also spelled Ibo[18][19] and formerly also Iboe, Ebo, Eboe,[20] Eboans,[21] Heebo;[22]\nnatively Ṇ́dị́ Ìgbò  In Nigeria, Igbos are indigenous to various states. Igbos are majorly found in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo States. A good population of Igbos are found in Delta and Rivers States while Igbos are a minority in Akwa ibom, Benue, Cross River, Edo and Kogi states. Large ethnic Igbo populations are found in Cameroon,[23] Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea,[24][25] as well as outside Africa. There has been much speculation about the origins of the Igbo people, as it is unknown how exactly the group came to form.[26] Geographically, the Igbo homeland is divided into two unequal sections by the Niger River – an eastern (which is the larger of the two) and a western section.[27][28] The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa.[29]","image":"Igbo_family_in_traditional_attire.jpg.webp"}
