{"title":"Geyser","summary":"A geyser (/ˈɡaɪzər/, UK: /ˈɡiːzər/)[1][2] is a spring characterized by an intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accompanied by steam. As a fairly rare phenomenon, the formation of geysers is due to particular hydrogeological conditions that exist only in a few places on Earth. Generally all geyser field sites are located near active volcanic areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of magma. Generally, surface water works its way down to an average depth of around 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) where it contacts hot rocks. The resultant boiling of the pressurized water results in the geyser effect of hot water and steam spraying out of the geyser's surface vent (a hydrothermal explosion).","image":"Strokkur_geyser_eruption%2C_close-up_view.jpg.webp","url":"Geyser"}
