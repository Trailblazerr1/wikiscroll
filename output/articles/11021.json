{"title":"Constructible number","summary":"In geometry and algebra, a real number \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n is constructible if and only if, given a line segment of unit length, a line segment of length \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        r\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |r|}\n  \n can be constructed with compass and straightedge in a finite number of steps. Equivalently, \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n is constructible if and only if there is a closed-form expression for \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n using only integers and the operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square roots.","image":"0d1ecb613aa2984f0576f70f86650b7c2a132538.svg"}
