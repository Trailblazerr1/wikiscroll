{"title":"Zimbabwe Rhodesia","summary":"Zimbabwe Rhodesia (/zɪmˈbɑːbweɪ roʊˈdiːʒə/) was an unrecognised state that existed from 1 June 1979 to 11 December 1979. Zimbabwe Rhodesia was preceded by an unrecognised republic named Rhodesia and was briefly followed by the re-established British colony of Southern Rhodesia, which according to British constitutional theory had remained the lawful government in the area after Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) in 1965. About three months later, the re-established colony of Southern Rhodesia was granted internationally recognised independence within the Commonwealth as the Republic of Zimbabwe.","image":"Flag_of_Zimbabwe_Rhodesia_(1979).svg.png.webp"}
