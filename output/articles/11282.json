{"title":"Cosmic ray","summary":"Cosmic rays are high-energy protons and atomic nuclei that move through space at nearly the speed of light. They originate from the Sun, from outside of the Solar System in our own galaxy,[1] and from distant galaxies.[2] Upon impact with Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays produce showers of secondary particles, some of which reach the surface; although the bulk is intercepted by the magnetosphere or the heliosphere.","image":"Cosmic_ray_flux_versus_particle_energy.svg.png.webp","url":"Cosmic_ray"}
