{"title":"Psoriasis","summary":"Psoriasis is a long-lasting, noncontagious[4] autoimmune disease characterized by raised areas of abnormal skin.[5] These areas are red, or purple on some people with darker skin,[8] dry, itchy, and scaly.[3] Psoriasis varies in severity from small, localized patches to complete body coverage.[3] Injury to the skin can trigger psoriatic skin changes at that spot, which is known as the Koebner phenomenon.[9]","image":"Psoriasis_on_back1.jpg.webp"}
