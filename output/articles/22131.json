{"title":"Interferometry","summary":"Interferometry is a  technique in which waves are superimposed to cause the phenomenon of interference, which is used to extract information.[1] Interferometry typically uses electromagnetic waves and is an important investigative technique in the fields of astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, oceanography, seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, optometry, and making holograms.[2]: 1–2","image":"Interferometer.svg.png.webp"}
