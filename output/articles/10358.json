{"title":"Co-Princes of Andorra","summary":"The co-princes of Andorra are jointly the heads of state (Catalan: cap d'estat)[1] of the Principality of Andorra, a landlocked microstate lying in the Pyrenees between France and Spain. Founded in 1278 by means of a treaty between the bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix, this unique diarchical arrangement has persisted through medieval times to the 21st century. Currently, the bishop of Urgell (Joan Enric Vives Sic√≠lia) and the president of France (Emmanuel Macron) serve as Andorra's co-princes, following the transfer of the count of Foix's claims to the Crown of France and, thence, to the president of France. Each co-prince appoints a personal representative, the French co-prince currently being represented by Patrick Strzoda and the Episcopal co-prince by Josep Maria Mauri.[2]","image":"Coat_of_Arms_of_the_high_authorities_of_Andorra.svg.png.webp","url":"Co-Princes_of_Andorra"}
