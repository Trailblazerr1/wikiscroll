{"title":"Extraterrestrial life","summary":"Extraterrestrial life[n 1] is hypothetical life forms that may be living in places other than the planet Earth and which did not originate on Earth. Such life might range from simple prokaryotes (or comparable life forms) to intelligent beings and even sapient beings, possibly bringing forth civilizations that might be far more advanced than humanity.[1][2][3] The Drake equation speculates about the existence of sapient life elsewhere in the universe. The science of extraterrestrial life in all its forms is known as astrobiology.","image":"Telescope_Kepler-NASA.jpeg.webp"}
