{"title":"Charity (Christian virtue)","summary":"In Christian theology, Charity (Latin Caritas) is considered one of the seven virtues and is understood by Thomas Aquinas as \"the friendship of man for God\", which \"unites us to God\". He holds it as \"the most excellent of the virtues\".[1] Further, Aquinas holds that \"the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor\".[2]","image":"Kazimirowski_Eugeniusz%2C_Divine_Mercy%2C_1934.jpg.webp","url":"Charity_(Christian_virtue)"}
