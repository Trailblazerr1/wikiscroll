{"title":"Tax haven","summary":"A tax haven is a jurisdiction with very low \"effective\" rates of taxation for foreign investors (\"headline\" rates may be higher).[lower-alpha 1][1][2][3][4][5] In some traditional definitions, a tax haven also offers financial secrecy.[lower-alpha 2][6] However, while countries with high levels of secrecy but also high rates of taxation, most notably the United States and Germany in the Financial Secrecy Index (\"FSI\") rankings,[lower-alpha 3] can be featured in some tax haven lists, they are not universally considered as tax havens. In contrast, countries with lower levels of secrecy but also low \"effective\" rates of taxation, most notably Ireland in the FSI rankings, appear in most § Tax haven lists.[9] The consensus on effective tax rates has led academics to note that the term \"tax haven\" and \"offshore financial centre\" are almost synonymous.[10]","image":"10_Percent_Legacy_and_Succession_Duty_Impressed_Duty_Stamp.svg.png.webp"}
