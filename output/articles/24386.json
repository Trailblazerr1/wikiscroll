{"title":"Karen Horney","summary":"Karen Horney (/ˈhɔːrnaɪ/;[2][3] née Danielsen; 16 September 1885 – 4 December 1952) was a German psychoanalyst who practiced in the United States during her later career. Her theories questioned some traditional Freudian views. This was particularly true of her theories of sexuality and of the instinct orientation of psychoanalysis. She is credited with founding feminist psychology in response to Freud's theory of penis envy. She disagreed with Freud about inherent differences in the psychology of men and women, and she traced such differences to society and culture rather than biology.[4] She is often classified as neo-Freudian.","image":"Karen_Horney_1938.jpg.webp"}
