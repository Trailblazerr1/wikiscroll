{"title":"Heart failure","summary":"Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF) and (congestive) cardiac failure (CCF), is a set of manifestations caused by the failure of the heart's function as a pump supporting the blood flow through the body; its signs and symptoms result from a structural and/or functional abnormality of the heart, that disrupts its filling with blood or its ejecting of it during each heart beat.[12][13][14] Signs and symptoms of heart failure commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling.[4] The shortness of breath is usually worse with exercise or while lying down, and may wake the person at night.[4] A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature.[15] Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.[16]","image":"Elevated_JVP.JPG.webp"}
