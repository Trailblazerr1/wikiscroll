{"title":"George Armitage Miller","summary":"George Armitage Miller (February 3, 1920 â€“ July 22, 2012)[1] was an American psychologist who was one of the founders of cognitive psychology, and more broadly, of cognitive science. He also contributed to the birth of psycholinguistics. Miller wrote several books and directed the development of WordNet, an online word-linkage database usable by computer programs. He authored the paper, \"The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,\" in which he observed that many different experimental findings considered together reveal the presence of an average limit of seven for human short-term memory capacity. This paper is frequently cited by psychologists and in the wider culture. Miller won numerous awards, including the National Medal of Science.","image":"George_Armitage_Miller_speaking_at_the_first_APS_convention_in_1989.jpg.webp","url":"George_Armitage_Miller"}
