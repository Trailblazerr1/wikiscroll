{"title":"Dugout canoe","summary":"A dugout canoe or simply dugout is a boat made from a hollowed tree. Other names for this type of boat are logboat and monoxylon. Monoxylon (μονόξυλον) (pl: monoxyla) is Greek -- mono- (single) + ξύλον xylon (tree) -- and is mostly used in classic Greek texts. In German, they are called Einbaum (\"one tree\" in English). Some, but not all, pirogues are also constructed in this manner.","image":"Boats_at_the_shore_of_the_malawi_lake.jpg.webp"}
