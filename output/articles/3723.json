{"title":"Anil Kumble","summary":"Anil Kumble (pronunciationÂ ; born 17 October 1970) is a former Indian cricket coach and commentator who played Test and One Day International cricket for his national team over an international career of 18 years. Widely regarded as one of the best leg spin bowlers in Test cricket history, he took 619 wickets in Test cricket and is the fourth highest wicket taker of all time as of 2021. In 1999 while playing against Pakistan, Kumble dismissed all ten batsmen in a Test match innings, joining England's Jim Laker as the only other player to achieve the feat at the time.[1][2][3] Unlike his contemporaries, Kumble was not a big turner of the ball, but relied primarily on pace, bounce, and accuracy. He was nicknamed \"Apple\" [4] and \"Jumbo\".[5] Kumble was selected as the Cricketer of the Year in 1993 Indian Cricket, and one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year three years later.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
