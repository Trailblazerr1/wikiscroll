{"title":"Danelaw","summary":"The Danelaw (/ˈdeɪnˌlɔː/, also known as the Danelagh; Old English: Dena lagu;[1] Danish: Danelagen) was the part of England in which the laws of the Danes held sway[2] and dominated those of the Anglo-Saxons. The Danelaw contrasts with the West Saxon law and the Mercian law. The term is first recorded in the early 11th century as Dena lage.[3] The areas that constituted the Danelaw lie in northern and eastern England, long occupied by Danes and other Norsemen.","image":"Raven_Banner.svg.png.webp","url":"Danelaw"}
