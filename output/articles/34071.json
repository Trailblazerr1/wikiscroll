{"title":"Pat Buchanan","summary":"Patrick Joseph Buchanan (/bjuːˈkænən/; born November 2, 1938) is an American paleoconservative political commentator, columnist, politician and broadcaster. Buchanan was an assistant and special consultant to U.S. Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Ronald Reagan, and was an original host on CNN's Crossfire.[1] In 1992, he sought the Republican presidential nomination against incumbent president George H.W. Bush, campaigning against Bush's breaking of his \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" pledge, as well as his foreign policy and positions on social issues. Buchanan did not win any primaries, but won 37.5 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, regarded as a strong showing; he went on to win almost 2,900,000 votes in the national primaries, for about 23 percent of the popular vote. At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Buchanan delivered his \"Culture War\" speech in support of President Bush. Buchanan again sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1996. In 2000, he was the Reform Party's presidential nominee. His campaign centered on non-interventionism in foreign affairs, opposition to illegal immigration and opposition to the outsourcing of manufacturing from free trade. He selected educator and conservative activist Ezola Foster as his running-mate.","image":"Patrickjbuchanan.JPG.webp","url":"Pat_Buchanan"}
