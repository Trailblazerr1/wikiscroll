{"title":"Māgha Pūjā","summary":"Māgha Pūjā (also written as Makha Bucha Day) is the second most important Buddhist festival,[1] celebrated on the full moon day of the third lunar month[5] in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Sri Lanka and on the full moon day of Tabaung in Myanmar. It celebrates a gathering that was held between the Buddha and 1,250 of his first disciples, which, according to tradition, preceded the custom of periodic recitation of discipline by monks. On the day, Buddhists celebrate the creation of an ideal and exemplary community, which is why it is sometimes called Saṅgha Day, the Saṅgha referring to the Buddhist community, and for some Buddhist schools this is specifically the monastic community.[6][1] In Thailand, the Pāli term Māgha-pūraṇamī is also used for the celebration, meaning 'to honor on the full moon of the third lunar month'.[7] Finally, some authors referred to the day as the Buddhist All Saints Day.[8][9]","image":"Magha_Puja.jpg.webp"}
