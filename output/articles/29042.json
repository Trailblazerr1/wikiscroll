{"title":"Mayaguez incident","summary":"The Mayaguez incident took place between Kampuchea (formerly Cambodia) and the United States from 12–15 May 1975, less than a month after the Khmer Rouge took control of the capital Phnom Penh ousting the U.S.-backed Khmer Republic. After the Khmer Rouge seized the U.S. merchant vessel SS Mayaguez in a disputed maritime area the U.S. mounted a hastily-prepared rescue operation. U.S. Marines recaptured the ship and attacked the island of Koh Tang where it was believed that the crew were being held as hostages.","image":"Two_crashed_U.S._Air_Force_CH-53_helicopters_on_Koh_Tang%2C_1975.jpg.webp","url":"Mayaguez_incident"}
