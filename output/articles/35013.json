{"title":"Pilus","summary":"A pilus (Latin for 'hair'; plural: pili) is a hair-like appendage found on the surface of many bacteria and archaea.[1]  The terms pilus and fimbria (Latin for 'fringe'; plural: fimbriae) can be used interchangeably, although some researchers reserve the term pilus for the appendage required for bacterial conjugation.  All pili in the latter sense are primarily composed of pilin proteins, which are oligomeric.","image":"Conjugation.svg.png.webp"}
