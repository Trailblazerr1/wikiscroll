{"title":"Rod of Asclepius","summary":"In Greek mythology, the Rod of Asclepius (Greek: Ράβδος του Ασκληπιού, Rábdos tou Asklipioú, sometimes also spelled Asklepios), also known as the Staff of Aesculapius  and as the asklepian,[1] is a serpent-entwined rod wielded by the Greek god Asclepius, a deity associated with healing and medicine. Theories have been proposed about the Greek origin of the symbol and its implications. In modern times, it is the predominant symbol for medicine and health care although, because of a misunderstanding, the Caduceus (the symbol of commerce) is sometimes seen in this context.[1]","image":"Star_of_life2.svg.png.webp","url":"Rod_of_Asclepius"}
