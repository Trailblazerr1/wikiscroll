{"title":"Graphical user interface","summary":"The graphical user interface (GUI /dʒiːjuːˈaɪ/ jee-you-eye[1][Note 1] or /ˈɡuːi/[2]) is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces (CLIs),[3][4][5] which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.","image":"Linux_kernel_INPUT_OUPUT_evdev_gem_USB_framebuffer.svg.png.webp"}
