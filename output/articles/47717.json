{"title":"Volkswagen emissions scandal","summary":"The Volkswagen emissions scandal, sometimes known as Dieselgate[23][24] or Emissionsgate,[25][26] began in September 2015, when the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation of the Clean Air Act to German automaker Volkswagen Group.[27] The agency had found that Volkswagen had intentionally programmed turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engines to activate their emissions controls only during laboratory emissions testing, which caused the vehicles' NO x  output to meet US standards during regulatory testing, while they emitted up to 40 times more NO x  in real-world driving.[28] Volkswagen deployed this software in about 11 million cars worldwide, including 500,000 in the United States, in model years 2009 through 2015.[29][30][31][32]","image":"VW_Golf_TDI_Clean_Diesel_WAS_2010_8983.JPG.webp","url":"Volkswagen_emissions_scandal"}
