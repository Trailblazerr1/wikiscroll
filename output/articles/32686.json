{"title":"Ocean","summary":"The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.[1] Another definition is \"any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided\".[2] Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest) Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest).[3][4] Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge  heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle.","image":"Earth_-_December_1990_(16332132156).jpg.webp"}
