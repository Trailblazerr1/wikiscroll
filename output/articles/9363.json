{"title":"Charles Whitman","summary":"Charles Joseph Whitman (June 24, 1941 â€“ August 1, 1966) was an American mass murderer who became infamous as the \"Texas Tower Sniper\". On August 1, 1966, Whitman used knives to kill his mother and his wife in their respective homes, then went to the University of Texas in Austin (UT Austin) with multiple firearms and began indiscriminately shooting at people. He fatally shot three people inside UT Austin's Main Building, then accessed the 28th-floor observation deck on the building's clock tower. There, he fired at random people for some 96 minutes, killing an additional eleven people and wounding 31 others before he was shot dead by Austin police officers. Whitman killed a total of sixteen adults and an unborn child; the 16th victim died 35 years later from injuries sustained in the attack.[2][3][4][5]","image":"Charles_Whitman_(1963).jpg.webp"}
