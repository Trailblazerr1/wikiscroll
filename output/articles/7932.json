{"title":"Burning bush","summary":"The burning bush (or the unburnt bush) was a supernatural phenomenon described in the third chapter of the Book of Exodus[1] that occurred on Mount Horeb. According to the biblical account, the bush was on fire, but was not consumed by the flames, hence the name.[2] In the biblical narrative, the burning bush is the location at which Moses was appointed by Yahweh to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into Canaan.","image":"Bourdon%2C_SÃ©bastien_-_Burning_bush.jpg.webp"}
