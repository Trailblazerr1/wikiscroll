{"title":"Liberal Party (UK)","summary":"The Liberal Party was one of the two major political parties in the United Kingdom with the opposing Conservative Party in the 19th and early 20th centuries.[3] The party arose from an alliance of Whigs and free tradeâ€“supporting Peelites and the reformist Radicals in the 1850s. By the end of the 19th century, it had formed four governments under William Gladstone. Despite being divided over the issue of Irish Home Rule, the party returned to government in 1905 and then won a landslide victory in the following year's general election.","image":"Liberal_Party_logo_(pre1988).png.webp"}
