{"title":"Chivalric romance","summary":"As a literary genre of high culture, heroic romance or chivalric romance is a type of prose and verse narrative that was popular in the noble courts  of High Medieval and Early Modern Europe. They were fantastic stories about marvel-filled adventures, often of a chivalric knight-errant portrayed as having heroic qualities, who goes on a quest.  It developed further from the epics as time went on; in particular, \"the emphasis on love and courtly manners distinguishes it from the chanson de geste and other kinds of epic, in which masculine military heroism predominates.\"[1]","image":"Ywain-Gawain.JPG.webp","url":"Chivalric_romance"}
