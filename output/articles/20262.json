{"title":"Hiccup","summary":"A hiccup (scientific name singultus, from a Latin word meaning \"to catch one's breath while sobbing\";[1] also spelled hiccough) is an involuntary contraction (myoclonic jerk) of the diaphragm that may repeat several times per minute. The hiccup is an involuntary action involving a reflex arc.[2] Once triggered, the reflex causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm followed about a quarter of a second later by closure of the vocal cords, which results in the \"hic\" sound.","image":"Hiccup_histogram.svg.png.webp","url":"Hiccup"}
