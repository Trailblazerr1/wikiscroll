{"title":"Xenarthra","summary":"Xenarthra (/zɛˈnɑːrθrə/; from Ancient Greek ξένος, xénos, “foreign, alien” + ἄρθρον, árthron, “joint”) is a major clade of placental mammals native to the Americas. There are 31 living species: the anteaters, tree sloths, and armadillos.[1] Extinct xenarthrans include the glyptodonts, pampatheres and ground sloths. Xenarthrans originated in South America during the Paleocene about 59 million years ago.[2] They evolved and diversified extensively in South America during the continent's long period of isolation in the early to mid Cenozoic Era. They spread to the Antilles by the early Miocene and, starting about 3 Mya, spread to Central and North America as part of the Great American Interchange.[3] Nearly all of the formerly abundant megafaunal xenarthrans became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene.","image":"Xenarthra.jpg.webp","url":"Xenarthra"}
