{"title":"Focus (optics)","summary":"In geometrical optics, a focus, also called an image point, is a point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge.[1] Although the focus is conceptually a point, physically the focus has a spatial extent, called the blur circle. This non-ideal focusing may be caused by aberrations of the imaging optics. In the absence of significant aberrations, the smallest possible blur circle is the Airy disc, which is caused by diffraction from the optical system's aperture. Aberrations tend to worsen as the aperture diameter increases, while the Airy circle is smallest for large apertures.","image":"Focusing_on_retina.svg.png.webp"}
