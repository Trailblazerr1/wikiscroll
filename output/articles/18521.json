{"title":"Gordie Howe","summary":"Gordon Howe OC (March 31, 1928 â€“ June 10, 2016) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. From 1946 to 1980, he played 26 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and six seasons in the World Hockey Association (WHA); his first 25 seasons were spent with the Detroit Red Wings. Nicknamed \"Mr. Hockey\", Howe is often considered the most complete player to ever play the game and one of the greatest of all time.[2][3] At his retirement, his 801 goals, 1049 assists, and 1850 total points were all NHL records that stood until they were broken by Wayne Gretzky, who himself has been a major champion of Howe's legacy. A 23-time NHL All-Star, he still holds the NHL record for seasons played, and his all-time NHL games played record of 1,767 was only surpassed in 2021 by Patrick Marleau. In 2017, Howe was named one of the \"100 Greatest NHL Players\".[4]","image":"Gordie_Howe_Chex_card.jpg.webp"}
