{"title":"Gas metal arc welding","summary":"Gas metal arc welding (GMAW), sometimes referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) and metal active gas (MAG) is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable MIG wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to fuse (melt and join).  Along with the wire electrode, a shielding gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from atmospheric contamination.","image":"Gas_Metal_Arc_Welding_(Mig).jpg.webp"}
