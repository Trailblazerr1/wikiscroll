{"title":"Golf course","summary":"A golf course is the grounds where the sport of golf is played. It consists of a series of holes, each consisting of a tee box, a fairway, the rough and other hazards, and a green with a cylindrical hole in the ground, known as a \"cup\". The cup holds a flagstick, known as a \"pin\". A standard round of golf consists of 18 holes.[1] Most courses contain 18 holes; some share fairways or greens, and a subset has nine holes, played twice per round. Par-3 courses consist of nine or 18 holes all of which have a par of three strokes.","image":"Golf_course_Golfplatz_Wittenbeck_Mecklenburg_Ostsee_Baltic_Sea_Germany.jpg.webp","url":"Golf_course"}
