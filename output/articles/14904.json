{"title":"Enthalpy of fusion","summary":"The enthalpy of fusion of a substance, also known as (latent) heat of fusion is the change in its enthalpy resulting from providing energy, typically heat, to a specific quantity of the substance to change its state from a solid to a liquid, at constant pressure. For example, when melting 1 kg of ice (at 0 °C under a wide range of pressures), 333.55 kJ of energy is absorbed with no temperature change. The heat of solidification (when a substance changes from liquid to solid) is equal and opposite.","image":"Enthalpies_of_melting_and_boiling_for_pure_elements_versus_temperatures_of_transition.svg.png.webp"}
