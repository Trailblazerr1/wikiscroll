{"title":"Non-FIFA international football","summary":"Non-FIFA international football is the segment of international football that is not overseen by FIFA. FIFA is the international governing body of association football, overseeing football globally and with running international representative matches. However, some international football takes place outside its purview. This often consists of matches involving sub-national entities such as islands, colonies, or autonomous regions. Representative matches also occur involving states with limited international recognition who are unable to qualify for FIFA membership. There are also a limited number of states whose representative teams are not affiliated to FIFA. Historically, a number of competitions occurred outside FIFA's auspices.[1][2] Member associations are national associations, usually affiliated to continental confederations which are subordinate to FIFA.[3]","image":"Flag_of_Germany.svg.png.webp"}
