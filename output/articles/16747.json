{"title":"Founding of Rome","summary":"The tale of the founding of Rome is recounted in traditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves as the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth. The most familiar of these myths, and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths, is the story of Romulus and Remus, twins who were suckled by a she-wolf as infants.[1] Another account, set earlier in time, claims that the Roman people are descended from Trojan War hero Aeneas, who escaped to Italy after the war, and whose son, Iulus, was the ancestor of the family of Julius Caesar.[2]  The archaeological evidence of human occupation of the area of modern-day Rome dates from about 14,000 years ago.[3]","image":"Kapitolinische_WÃ¶lfin_Museum_Capitolini.jpg.webp","url":"Founding_of_Rome"}
