{"title":"Camel case","summary":"Camel case (sometimes stylized as camelCase or CamelCase, also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals) is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case.  Common examples include \"iPhone\" and \"eBay\". It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as \"johnSmith\", and to make multi-word domain names more legible, for example in promoting \"EasyWidgetCompany.com\".","image":"CamelCase_new.svg.png.webp","url":"Camel_case"}
