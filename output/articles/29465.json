{"title":"Metabolic acidosis","summary":"Metabolic acidosis is a serious electrolyte disorder characterized by an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. Metabolic acidosis has three main root causes: increased acid production, loss of bicarbonate, and a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete excess acids.[6] Metabolic acidosis can lead to acidemia, which is defined as arterial blood pH that is lower than 7.35.[7] Acidemia and acidosis are not mutually exclusive â€“ pH and hydrogen ion concentrations also depend on the coexistence of other acid-base disorders; therefore, pH levels in people with metabolic acidosis can range from low, normal, to high.","image":"Bicarbonate_Levels_in_Metabolic_Acidosis.jpg.webp","url":"Metabolic_acidosis"}
