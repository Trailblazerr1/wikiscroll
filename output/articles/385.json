{"title":"2003 invasion of Iraq","summary":"The 2003 invasion of Iraq[lower-alpha 1] was the first stage of the Iraq War. The invasion phase began on 19 March 2003 (air) and 20 March 2003 (ground) and lasted just over one month,[26] including 26 days of major combat operations, in which a combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded Iraq. This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May 2003 when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the \"end of major combat operations\", after which the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005. U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011.[27]","image":"U.S._Marines_with_Iraqi_POWs_-_March_21%2C_2003.jpg.webp","url":"2003_invasion_of_Iraq"}
