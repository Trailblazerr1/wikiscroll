{"title":"Adamantane","summary":"Adamantane is an organic compound with a formula C10H16 or, more descriptively, (CH)4(CH2)6. Adamantane molecules can be described as the fusion of three cyclohexane rings. The molecule is both rigid and virtually stress-free. Adamantane is the most stable isomer of C10H16. The spatial arrangement of carbon atoms in the adamantane molecule is the same as in the diamond crystal. This similarity led to the name adamantane, which is derived from the Greek adamantinos (relating to steel or diamond).[4] It is a white solid with a camphor-like odor. It is the simplest diamondoid.","image":"Adamantane_acsv.svg.png.webp","url":"Adamantane"}
