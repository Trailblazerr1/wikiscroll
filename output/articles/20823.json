{"title":"Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)","summary":"Horseshoe Curve is a three-track (though originally four) railroad curve on Norfolk Southern Railway's Pittsburgh Line in Blair County, Pennsylvania. The curve itself is about 2,375 feet (700 m) long and 1,300 feet (400 m) in diameter; it was completed in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Railroad as a way to lessen the grade to the summit of the Allegheny Mountains. It eventually replaced the time-consuming Allegheny Portage Railroad, the only other route across the mountains for large vehicles.  Because of the Allegheny Mountains geoform, in and around Altoona - and almost perfectly at \"The Curve\" - westbound traffic goes south and eastbound traffic goes north.  So, in terms of final destination, the southern side of \"The Curve\" is where trains leave to go west, and vice versa.","image":"Horseshoe_Curve_aerial_photo%2C_March_2006.jpg.webp","url":"Horseshoe_Curve_(Pennsylvania)"}
