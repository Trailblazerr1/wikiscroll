{"title":"Genomic imprinting","summary":"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner.[1][2][3][4][5] Genes however, can also be partially imprinted. Partial imprinting happens when alleles from both parents are differently expressed rather than complete expression and complete suppression of one parent's allele.[6] Forms of genomic imprinting have been demonstrated in fungi, plants and animals.[7][8] As of 2014, there are about 150 imprinted genes known in the mouse and about half that in humans.[9] In 2019, 260 imprinted genes have been reported in mice and 228 in humans.[10]","image":"Closed_Access_logo_transparent.svg.png.webp","url":"Genomic_imprinting"}
