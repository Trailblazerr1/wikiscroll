{"title":"Surface tension","summary":"Surface tension is the tendency of liquid surfaces at rest to shrink into the minimum surface area possible. Surface tension is what allows objects with a higher density than water such as razor blades and insects (e.g. water striders) to float on a water surface without becoming even partly submerged.","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg"}
