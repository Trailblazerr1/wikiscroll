{"title":"Chirality (chemistry)","summary":"In chemistry, a molecule or ion is called chiral (/kaɪˈræl/) if it cannot be superposed on its mirror image by any combination of rotations, translations, and some conformational changes. This geometric property is called chirality.[1][2][3][4]  The terms are derived from Ancient Greek χείρ (cheir), meaning \"hand\"; which is the canonical example of an object with this property.","image":"Chirality_with_hands.svg.png.webp","url":"Chirality_(chemistry)"}
