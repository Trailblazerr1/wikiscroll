{"title":"Rhinemaidens","summary":"The Rhinemaidens are the three water-nymphs (Rheintöchter or \"Rhine daughters\") who appear in Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Their individual names are Woglinde, Wellgunde and Flosshilde (Floßhilde), although they are generally treated as a single entity and they act together accordingly. Of the 34 characters in the Ring cycle, they are the only ones who did not originate in the Old Norse Eddas. Wagner created his Rhinemaidens from other legends and myths, most notably the Nibelungenlied which contains stories involving water-sprites (nixies) or mermaids of the Danube.","image":"Wagnersmaidens.jpg.webp","url":"Rhinemaidens"}
