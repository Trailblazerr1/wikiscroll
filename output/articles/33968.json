{"title":"Parliament of Singapore","summary":"The Parliament of Singapore and the president jointly make up the legislature of Singapore. Largely based from the Westminster system, the Parliament is unicameral and is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs) who are elected, as well as Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) and Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) who are appointed. Following the 2020 general election, 93 (now 92) MPs and two NCMPs were elected to the 14th Parliament. Nine NMPs will usually be appointed by the president.","image":"Parliament_of_Singapore_Logo.png.webp"}
