{"title":"Dermatome (anatomy)","summary":"A dermatome is an area of skin that is mainly supplied by afferent nerve fibres from the dorsal root of any given spinal nerve.[1][2] There are 8 cervical nerves (C1 being an exception with no dermatome), 12 thoracic nerves, 5 lumbar nerves and 5 sacral nerves. Each of these nerves relays sensation (including pain) from a particular region of skin to the brain.","image":"Grant_1962_663.png.webp","url":"Dermatome_(anatomy)"}
