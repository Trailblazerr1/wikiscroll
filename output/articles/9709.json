{"title":"Chinese room","summary":"The Chinese room argument holds that a digital computer executing a program cannot have a \"mind\", \"understanding\" or \"consciousness\",[lower-alpha 1] regardless of how intelligently or human-like the program may make the computer behave.  The argument was presented by philosopher John Searle in his paper, \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in Behavioral and Brain Sciences in 1980. Similar arguments were presented by Gottfried Leibniz (1714),  Anatoly Dneprov (1961), Lawrence Davis (1974) and Ned Block (1978). Searle's version has been widely discussed in the years since.[1] The centerpiece of Searle's argument is a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.[2]","image":"Anatomy-1751201_1280.png.webp","url":"Chinese_room"}
