{"title":"Crimea","summary":"Crimea[lower-alpha 1] is a peninsula along the northern coast of the Black Sea in Eastern Europe. It is almost entirely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller Sea of Azov to the northeast. Crimea is located south of Kherson Oblast in Ukraine, to which it is connected by the Isthmus of Perekop, and lies west of Krasnodar Krai in Russia, from which it is separated by the Strait of Kerch though linked by the Crimean Bridge since 2018. The Arabat Spit is located to its northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named Sivash from the Sea of Azov. To the peninsula's west, across the Black Sea, lies Romania, and to its south, Turkey.","image":"Satellite_picture_of_Crimea%2C_Terra-MODIS%2C_05-16-2015.jpg.webp","url":"Crimea"}
