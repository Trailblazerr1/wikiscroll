{"title":"Mormonism","summary":"Mormonism is the religious tradition and theology of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity started by Joseph Smith in Western New York in the 1820s and 1830s. As a label, Mormonism has been applied to various aspects of the Latter Day Saint movement, although there has been a recent push from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to distance themselves from this label. A historian, Sydney E. Ahlstrom, wrote in 1982, \"One cannot even be sure, whether [Mormonism] is a sect, a mystery cult, a new religion, a church, a people, a nation, or an American subculture; indeed, at different times and places it is all of these\".[1][2] However, scholars and theologians within the Latter Day Saint movement, including Smith, have often used \"Mormonism\" to describe the unique teachings and doctrines of the movement.[3]","image":"Mormon-book.jpg.webp"}
