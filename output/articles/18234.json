{"title":"Global warming potential","summary":"Global warming potential (GWP) is the heat absorbed by any greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as a multiple of the heat that would be absorbed by the same mass of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWP is 1 for CO2. For other gases it depends on the gas and the time frame.","image":"5fbe620888072f6ef5c190373299db72444ce32d.svg"}
