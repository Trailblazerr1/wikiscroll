{"title":"Haussmann's renovation of Paris","summary":"Haussmann's renovation of Paris  was a vast public works programme commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III and directed by his prefect of Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, between 1853 and 1870.  It included the demolition of medieval neighbourhoods that were deemed overcrowded and unhealthy by officials at the time; the building of wide avenues; new parks and squares; the annexation of the suburbs surrounding Paris; and the construction of new sewers, fountains and aqueducts. Haussmann's work was met with fierce opposition, and he was finally dismissed by Napoleon III in 1870; but work on his projects continued until 1927.  The street plan and distinctive appearance of the centre of Paris today are largely the result of Haussmann's renovation.","image":"Camille_Pissarro_-_Avenue_de_l'Opera_-_Musée_des_Beaux-Arts_Reims.jpg.webp"}
