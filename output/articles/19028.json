{"title":"Gropecunt Lane","summary":"Gropecunt Lane (/ˈɡroʊpkʌnt/) is a street found in English towns and cities during the Middle Ages, believed to be a reference to the prostitution centred on those areas; it was normal practice for a medieval street name to reflect the street's function or the economic activity taking place within it.  Gropecunt, the earliest known use of which is in about 1230, appears to have been derived as a compound of the words grope and cunt.  Streets with that name were often in the busiest parts of medieval towns and cities, and at least one appears to have been an important thoroughfare.","image":"Magpie_lane.jpg.webp","url":"Gropecunt_Lane"}
