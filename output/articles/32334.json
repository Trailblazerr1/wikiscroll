{"title":"Norse colonization of North America","summary":"The Norse colonization of North America began in the late 10th century, when Norsemen explored and settled areas of the North Atlantic including the northeastern fringes of North America.[1] Remains of Norse buildings were found at L'Anse aux Meadows near the northern tip of Newfoundland in 1960 dating to approximately 1,000 years ago.[2][3] This single settlement, located in the island of Newfoundland and not in the North American mainland, was abruptly abandoned less than ten years after being built.[4] In 2021 a combination of accelerator mass spectrometry to measure carbon-14 and tree ring counting enabled researchers to show that several pieces of wood were cut by the Norse precisely in the year 1021.[5]","image":"Christian-krohg-leiv-eriksson.jpg.webp"}
