{"title":"George Jones","summary":"George Glenn Jones (September 12, 1931 â€“ April 26, 2013) was an American musician, singer, and songwriter. He achieved international fame for his long list of hit records, including his best-known song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\", as well as his distinctive voice and phrasing. For the last two decades of his life, Jones was frequently referred to as the greatest living country singer.[1][2] Country music scholar Bill Malone writes, \"For the two or three minutes consumed by a song, Jones immerses himself so completely in its lyrics, and in the mood it conveys, that the listener can scarcely avoid becoming similarly involved.\" The shape of his nose and facial features earned Jones the nickname \"The Possum\".[3]","image":"George_JonesCFF.JPG.webp","url":"George_Jones"}
