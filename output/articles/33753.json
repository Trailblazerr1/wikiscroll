{"title":"Pan Am","summary":"Pan American World Airways, originally founded as Pan American Airways[1] and commonly known as Pan Am, was the principal and largest international air carrier and unofficial overseas flag carrier of the United States for much of the 20th century. It was the first airline to fly worldwide and pioneered numerous innovations of the modern airline industry, such as jet aircraft, jumbo jets, and computerized reservation systems.[2][3] Until its dissolution in 1991, Pan Am \"epitomized the luxury and glamour of intercontinental travel\",[4] and it remains a cultural icon of the 20th century, identified by its blue globe logo (\"The Blue Meatball\"),[5] the use of the word \"Clipper\" in its aircraft names and call signs, and the white uniform caps of its pilots.","image":"Pan_Am_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Pan_Am"}
