{"title":"Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft","summary":"In the early morning hours of March 18, 1990, thirteen works of art were stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. Guards admitted two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call, and the thieves tied the guards up and looted the museum over the next hour. The case is unsolved; no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has valued the haul at $500 million, and the museum is offering a $10 million reward for information leading to the art's recovery, the largest bounty ever offered by a private institution.","image":"Empty_Frames_at_Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_theft"}
