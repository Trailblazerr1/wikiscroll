{"title":"Christiaan Barnard","summary":"Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922 â€“ 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant operation.[1][2] On 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of accident-victim Denise Darvall into the chest of 54-year-old Louis Washkansky, with Washkansky regaining full consciousness and being able to talk easily with his wife, before dying eighteen days later of pneumonia, largely brought on by the anti-rejection drugs that suppressed his immune system.[3][4][5][6]  Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, an assessment which has been criticised as misleading.[7][8][9] Barnard's second transplant patient, Philip Blaiberg, whose operation was performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for a year and a half and was able to go home from the hospital.[5][10]","image":"Christiaan_Barnard_1969.jpg.webp"}
