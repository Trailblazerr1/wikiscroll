{"title":"Grand Prix motor racing","summary":"Grand Prix motor racing, a form of motorsport competition, has its roots in organised automobile racing that began in France as early as 1894.[1] It quickly evolved from simple road races from one town to the next, to endurance tests for car and driver. Innovation and the drive of competition soon saw speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour (160Â km/h), but because early races took place on open roads, accidents occurred frequently, resulting in deaths both of drivers and of spectators.[1] A common abbreviation used for Grand Prix racing is \"GP\" or \"GP racing\".","image":"Marcel_Renault_1903.jpg.webp"}
