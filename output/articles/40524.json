{"title":"Shrek the Third","summary":"Shrek the Third (also known as Shrek 3) is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film loosely based on the 1990 picture book Shrek! by William Steig. Directed by Chris Miller (in his feature-length directorial debut) and co-directed by Raman Hui, it is the third installment in the Shrek film series and the sequel to Shrek 2 (2004). The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, Rupert Everett, Julie Andrews, and John Cleese reprising their voice roles from the previous films, along with new additions such as Justin Timberlake as Arthur Pendragon and Eric Idle as Merlin. In the plot, Prince Charming is plotting to overthrow Shrek and Fiona, who have inherited the throne following King Harold's death. Shrek, who does not want to rule the kingdom and does not believe an ogre is fit to be king, attempts to convince Fiona's underachieving, 16-year-old cousin Artie to reign instead.","image":"Shrek_the_third_ver2.jpg.webp","url":"Shrek_the_Third"}
