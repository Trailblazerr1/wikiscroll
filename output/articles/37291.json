{"title":"Realpolitik","summary":"Realpolitik (German: [ʁeˈaːlpoliˌtiːk]; from German  real 'realistic, practical, actual', and  Politik 'politics') is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. In this respect, it shares aspects of its philosophical approach with those of realism and pragmatism. It is often simply referred to as \"pragmatism\" in politics, e.g. \"pursuing pragmatic policies\". The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are perceived as coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian.[1]","image":"Otto_Fürst_von_Bismarck.JPG.webp","url":"Realpolitik"}
