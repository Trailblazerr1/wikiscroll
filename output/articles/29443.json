{"title":"Meson","summary":"In particle physics, mesons (/ˈmiːzɒnz/ or /ˈmɛzɒnz/) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of an equal number of quarks and antiquarks, usually one of each, bound together by strong interactions. Because mesons are composed of quark subparticles, they have a meaningful physical size, a diameter of roughly one femtometer (1×10−15 m),[1] which is about 0.6 times the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond.  Heavier mesons decay to lighter mesons and ultimately to stable electrons, neutrinos and photons.","image":"Meson_nonet_-_spin_0.svg.png.webp","url":"Meson"}
