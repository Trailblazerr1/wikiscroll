{"title":"United States Coast Guard","summary":"The United States Coast Guard (USCG) is the maritime security, search and rescue, and law enforcement service branch of the United States Armed Forces[6] and one of the country's eight uniformed services. The Coast Guard is a maritime, military, multi-mission service unique among the U.S. military branches for having a maritime law enforcement mission with jurisdiction in both domestic and international waters and a federal regulatory agency mission as part of its duties. It operates under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, and can be transferred to the U.S. Department of the Navy under the Department of Defense by the U.S. President at any time, or by the U.S. Congress during times of war. Prior to its transfer to Homeland Security, it operated under the Department of Transportation from 1967 to 2003 and the Department of the Treasury from its inception until 1967.[7][8] A congressional authority transfer has only happened once: in 1917, during World War I.[9] When the U.S. entered World War II in December 1941, the Coast Guard had already been transferred by Franklin Roosevelt in November.[10]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Coast_Guard.svg.png.webp","url":"United_States_Coast_Guard"}
