{"title":"J-pop","summary":"J-pop (Japanese: ジェイポップ, jeipoppu; often stylized as J-POP; an abbreviated form of \"Japanese popular music\"), natively also known simply as pops (ポップス, poppusu), is a musical genre that entered the musical mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop has its roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese music in the early 1970s.[1] J-pop was further defined by new wave and crossover fusion acts of the late 1970s such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Southern All Stars,[2] then Eurobeat in the early 1990s, namely Namie Amuro.[3]","image":"藤山一郎.jpg.webp","url":"J-pop"}
