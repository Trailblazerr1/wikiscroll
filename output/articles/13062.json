{"title":"Diophantine equation","summary":"In mathematics, a Diophantine equation is a polynomial equation, usually involving two or more unknowns, such that the only solutions of interest are the integer ones (an integer solution is such that all the unknowns take integer values). A linear Diophantine equation equates to a constant the sum of two or more monomials, each of degree one.  An exponential Diophantine equation is one in which unknowns can appear in exponents.","image":"Rtriangle.svg.png.webp","url":"Diophantine_equation"}
