{"title":"Scouse","summary":"Scouse (/ska äs/; formally known as Liverpool English[2] or Merseyside English)[3][4][5] is an accent and dialect of English associated with Liverpool and the surrounding county of Merseyside. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive; having been influenced heavily by Irish, Norwegian, and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks,[6] it has little in common with the accents of its neighbouring regions or the rest of England.[7] The accent is named after scouse, a stew eaten by sailors and locals.","image":"Merseyside_UK_locator_map_2010.svg.png.webp","url":"Scouse"}
