{"title":"Mathematical model","summary":"A mathematical model is a description of a  system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of developing a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, chemistry) and engineering disciplines (such as computer science, electrical engineering), as well as in non-physical systems such as the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology, political science). The use of mathematical models to solve problems in business or military operations is a large part of the field of operations research.  Mathematical models are also used in music,[1] linguistics,[2] and philosophy (for example, intensively in analytic philosophy).","image":"Blackbox3D-withGraphs.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_model"}
