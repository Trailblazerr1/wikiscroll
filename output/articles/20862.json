The HUAC was created in 1938 to investigate alleged disloyalty and subversive activities on the part of private citizens, public employees, and those organizations suspected of having either fascist or  communist ties. When the House abolished the committee in 1975,[1] its functions were transferred to the House Judiciary Committee.","image":"Chairman_Dies_of_House_Committee_investigating_Un-American_activities.jpg.webp","url":"House_Un-American_Activities_Committee"}
