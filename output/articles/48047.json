{"title":"Waterloo & City line","summary":"The Waterloo & City line, colloquially known as The Drain,[3] is a London Underground shuttle line that runs between Waterloo and Bank with no intermediate stops. Its primary traffic consists of commuters from south-west London, Surrey and Hampshire arriving at Waterloo main line station and travelling forward to the City of London financial district, and for this reason the line, except in very limited circumstances, does not operate on Sundays or public holidays. It is one of only two lines on the Underground network to run completely underground, the other being the Victoria line.","image":"Waterloo_%26_City_line_flag_box.svg.png.webp"}
