{"title":"Okazaki fragments","summary":"Okazaki fragments are short sequences of DNA nucleotides (approximately 150 to 200 base pairs long in eukaryotes) which are synthesized discontinuously and later linked together by the enzyme DNA ligase to create the lagging strand during DNA replication.[1] They were discovered in the 1960s by the Japanese molecular biologists Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki, along with the help of some of their colleagues.","image":"Asymmetry_in_the_synthesis_of_leading_and_lagging_strands.svg.png.webp"}
