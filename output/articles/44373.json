{"title":"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock","summary":"\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", commonly known as \"Prufrock\", is the first professionally published poem by American-born British poet T. S. Eliot (1888–1965). Eliot began writing \"Prufrock\" in February 1910, and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse[1] at the instigation of Ezra Pound (1885–1972). It was later printed as part of a twelve-poem pamphlet (or chapbook) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917.[2] At the time of its publication, Prufrock was considered outlandish,[3] but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th-century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism.","image":"Prufrock_And_Other_Observations.jpg.webp"}
