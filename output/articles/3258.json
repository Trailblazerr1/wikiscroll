{"title":"American Indian Wars","summary":"The American Indian Wars, also known as the American Frontier Wars, the First Nations Wars in Canada (French: Guerres des Premi√®res Nations), and the Indian Wars, were fought by European governments and colonists, and later by the United States and Canadian governments and American and Canadian settlers, against various American Indian and First Nation tribes. These conflicts occurred in North America from the time of the earliest colonial settlements in the 17th century until the early 20th century. The various wars resulted from a wide variety of factors. The European powers and their colonies also enlisted allied Indian tribes to help them conduct warfare against each other's colonial settlements. After the American Revolution, many conflicts were local to specific states or regions and frequently involved disputes over land use; some entailed cycles of violent reprisal.","image":"Cavalry_and_Indians.JPG.webp","url":"American_Indian_Wars"}
