{"title":"Suez Crisis","summary":"The Suez Crisis, or the Second Arab–Israeli war,[16][17][18] also called the Tripartite Aggression (Arabic: العدوان الثلاثي‎, romanized: Al-ʿUdwān aṯ-Ṯulāṯiyy) in the Arab world[19] and the Sinai War in Israel,[20]\nwas an invasion of Egypt in late 1956 by Israel, followed by the United Kingdom and France. The aims were to regain control of the Suez Canal for the Western powers and to remove Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who had just nationalised the foreign-owned Suez Canal Company, which administered the canal.[21] After the fighting had started, political pressure from the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Nations led to a withdrawal by the three invaders. The episode humiliated the United Kingdom and France and strengthened Nasser.[22][23][24]","image":"Tanks_Destroyed_Sinai.jpg.webp"}
