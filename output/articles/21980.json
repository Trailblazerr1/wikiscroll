{"title":"Information visualization","summary":"Information visualization (or visualisation) is the study of visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. It is related to data visualization, infographics, and scientific visualization. One definition is that it's information visualization when the spatial representation (e.g., the page layout of a graphic design) is chosen, whereas it's scientific visualization when the spatial representation is given.[1]","image":"WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png.webp"}
