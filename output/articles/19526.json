{"title":"Hand, foot, and mouth disease","summary":"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infection caused by a group of enteroviruses.[10] It typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell.[10] This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet and mouth and occasionally buttocks and groin.[1][2][11] Signs and symptoms normally appear 3â€“6 days after exposure to the virus.[4] The rash generally resolves on its own in about a week.[5] Fingernail and toenail loss may occur a few weeks later, but they will regrow with time.[3]","image":"Hand_Foot_Mouth_Disease.png.webp","url":"Hand,_foot,_and_mouth_disease"}
