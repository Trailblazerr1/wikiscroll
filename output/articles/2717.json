{"title":"Alcoholics Anonymous","summary":"Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is an international fellowship requiring no membership dues or fees, dedicated to helping alcoholics peer to peer in sobriety through its spiritually inclined Twelve Steps program.[1][2][3] Structurally guided by its Twelve Traditions, AA is set up as non-professional, non-denominational, as well as self-supporting and apolitical, with an avowed desire to stop drinking being its sole requirement for membership.[1][2][4] AA has not endorsed the disease model of alcoholism, to which its program is nonetheless sympathetic, but its wider acceptance is partly due to many members independently promulgating it.[5] As of 2020, having spread to diverse cultures, including geopolitical areas normally resistant to grassroots movements, AA has had an estimated worldwide membership of over two million with 75% of those in the U.S. and Canada.[6][7]","image":"Alcoholics_Anonymous%2C_Book_Cover%2C_4th_Edition.jpg.webp"}
