{"title":"Carthusians","summary":"The Carthusians, also known as the Order of Carthusians (Latin: Ordo Cartusiensis), are a Latin enclosed religious order of the Catholic Church. The order was founded by Bruno of Cologne in 1084 and includes both monks and nuns. The order has its own rule, called the Statutes, and their life combines both eremitical and cenobitic monasticism. The motto of the Carthusians is Stat crux dum volvitur orbis, Latin for \"The Cross is steady while the world turns.\"[3] The Carthusians retain a unique form of liturgy known as the Carthusian Rite.","image":"Carthusian_coat_of_arms-2006_11_30_murraybuckley.svg.png.webp"}
