{"title":"Fuchsia (operating system)","summary":"Fuchsia is an open-source capability-based operating system developed by Google. In contrast to prior Google-developed operating systems such as Chrome OS and Android, which are based on the Linux kernel, Fuchsia is based on a new kernel named Zircon. It first became known to the public when the project appeared on a self-hosted git repository in August 2016 without any official announcement. After years of development, Fuchsia was officially released to the public on the first-generation Google Nest Hub, replacing its original Cast OS.","image":"Google_Fuchsia_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Fuchsia_(operating_system)"}
