{"title":"Coptic language","summary":"Coptic (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ, timetremənkhēmi) is a family of closely-related dialects[6] descended from the Ancient Egyptian language[7] and historically spoken by the Copts of Egypt.[8] Coptic was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as the primary spoken language of Egypt following the Muslim conquest of Egypt, although it remains in use today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Church.[9] Innovations in grammar, phonology, and the influx of Greek loanwords distinguish Coptic from earlier periods of the Egyptian language. It is written with the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet with several additional letters borrowed from the Demotic Egyptian script.[10]","image":"Eye_of_Horus_bw.svg.png.webp"}
