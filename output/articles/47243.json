{"title":"Venison","summary":"Venison originally meant the meat of a game animal but now refers primarily to the meat of horned ungulates such as elk or deer (or antelope in South Africa).[1] Venison can be used to refer to any part of the animal, so long as it is edible, including the internal organs. Venison, much like beef or pork, is categorized into specific cuts, including roast, sirloin, and ribs.","image":"Venison_escalope_raw.jpg.webp"}
