{"title":"Natural transformation","summary":"In category theory, a branch of mathematics, a natural transformation provides a way of transforming one functor into another while respecting the internal structure (i.e., the composition of morphisms) of the categories involved. Hence, a natural transformation can be considered to be a \"morphism of functors\". Indeed, this intuition can be formalized to define so-called functor categories. Natural transformations are, after categories and functors, one of the most fundamental notions of category theory and consequently appear in the majority of its applications.","image":"545fd099af8541605f7ee55f08225526be88ce57.svg","url":"Natural_transformation"}
