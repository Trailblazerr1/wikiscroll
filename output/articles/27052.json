{"title":"List of vice presidents of the Philippines","summary":"This is a complete list of vice-presidents of the Philippines, who were inaugurated as Vice-President of the Philippines following the ratification of a constitution that explicitly declared the existence of the Philippines. The inclusion of Mariano Tr√≠as in the list is disputed, because Trias was chosen as vice-president at the Tejeros Convention, and again as vice-president for the short-lived Republic of Biak-na-Bato, which was dissolved after the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and Aguinaldo's exile. Neither the reassumption of power by Emilio Aguinaldo when the revolution was resumed in May 1898 nor his formal proclamation and inauguration as President under the First Philippine Republic in 1899 were regimes that provided for a vice-presidency. The vice-presidency within the context of the Philippine government was formally created by the constitution in 1935.","image":"Seal_of_the_Vice_President_of_the_Republic_of_the_Philippines.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_vice_presidents_of_the_Philippines"}
