{"title":"Gas constant","summary":"The molar gas constant (also known as the gas constant, universal gas constant, or ideal gas constant) is denoted by the symbol R or R. It is the molar equivalent to the Boltzmann constant, expressed in units of energy per temperature increment per mole, i.e. the pressureâ€“volume product, rather than energy per temperature increment per particle. The constant is also a combination of the constants from Boyle's law, Charles's law, Avogadro's law, and Gay-Lussac's law.  It is a physical constant that is featured in many fundamental equations in the physical  sciences, such as the ideal gas law, the Arrhenius equation, and the Nernst equation.","image":"817f1df1bebb6f778c63385d44bbbe4d817b5d2b.svg","url":"Gas_constant"}
