{"title":"Catholic Monarchs of Spain","summary":"The term Catholic Monarchs[lower-alpha 1][lower-alpha 2] refers to Queen Isabella I of Castile[1] and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, whose marriage and joint rule marked the de facto unification of Spain.[2] They were both from the House of Trast√°mara and were second cousins, being both descended from John I of Castile; to remove the obstacle that this consanguinity would otherwise have posed to their marriage under canon law, they were given a papal dispensation by Sixtus IV. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger. It is generally accepted by most scholars that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella.","image":"Catholic_monarch_territories-1500.jpg.webp"}
