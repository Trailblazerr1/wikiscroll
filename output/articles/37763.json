{"title":"Revival (Selena Gomez album)","summary":"Revival is the second solo – fifth overall – studio album by American singer Selena Gomez. It was released on October 9, 2015, by Interscope and Polydor Records, her first album released through that label. Preparation for the album began in 2014, when Gomez left her previous label Hollywood Records. The record was influenced by a range of artists, particularly Christina Aguilera and her album Stripped (2002). Gomez co-wrote twelve of its sixteen tracks. The album reflects her journey since 2013, including the media scrutiny of her personal life. As executive producers, Gomez, Danny D and Tim Blacksmith collaborated with Hit-Boy, Rock Mafia, and Stargate to achieve Gomez's new desired sound. Revival is primarily a dance-pop and electropop record, that is connected by a tropical beach sound. Lyrically, the album discusses themes of love and confidence.","image":"Selena_Gomez_-_Revival_(Official_Standard_Cover).png.webp","url":"Revival_(Selena_Gomez_album)"}
