{"title":"Wind shear","summary":"Wind shear (or windshear), sometimes referred to as wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere. Atmospheric wind shear is normally described as either vertical or horizontal wind shear. Vertical wind shear is a change in wind speed or direction with a change in altitude.  Horizontal wind shear is a change in wind speed with a change in lateral position for a given altitude.[1]","image":"Cirrus_clouds2.jpg.webp"}
