{"title":"Ēostre","summary":"Ēostre (Old English: *Ēastre [ˈæːɑstre],[1] Northumbrian dialect Ēastro,[2] Mercian dialect and West Saxon dialect (Old English) Ēostre [ˈeːostre];[3] Old High German: *Ôstara; Old Saxon *Āsteron) is a West Germanic spring goddess.[4][5] By way of the Germanic month bearing her name (Northumbrian: Ēosturmōnaþ; West Saxon: Ēastermōnaþ; Old High German: Ôstarmânoth), she is the namesake of the festival of Easter in some languages. Ēostre is attested solely by Bede in his 8th-century work The Reckoning of Time, where Bede states that during Ēosturmōnaþ (the equivalent of April), pagan Anglo-Saxons had held feasts in Ēostre's honour, but that this tradition had died out by his time, replaced by the Christian Paschal month, a celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.","image":"Ostara_by_Johannes_Gehrts.jpg.webp"}
