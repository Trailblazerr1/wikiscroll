{"title":"Lacquer","summary":"Lacquer is a type of hard and potentially shiny coating or finish applied to materials such as wood or metal. The term originates from the Sanskrit word lākshā (लाक्षा), representing the number one hundred thousand (100,000), which was used for both the lac insect (because of their enormous number) and the scarlet resinous secretion, rich in shellac that it produces, used as wood finish in ancient India and neighbouring areas.[1]","image":"MS-PerlmuttlackPäoniendose16Jh.JPG.webp","url":"Lacquer"}
