{"title":"Workweek and weekend","summary":"The weekdays  and weekend are the complementary parts of the week devoted to labour and rest, respectively. The legal weekdays (British English), or workweek (American English), is the part of the seven-day week devoted to working. In most of the world, the workweek is from Monday to Friday and the weekend is Saturday and Sunday. A weekday or workday is any day of the working week. Other institutions often follow this pattern, such as places of education. The constituted weekend has varying definitions, based on determined calendar days, designated period of time, and/or regional definition of the working week (e.g., commencing after 5:00 p.m. on Friday and lasting until 6:00 p.m. on Sunday). Sometimes the term \"weekend\" is expanded to include the time after work hours on the last workday of the week (e.g., Friday evening is often referred to as the start of the weekend).","image":"Workweeks-map.svg.png.webp","url":"Workweek_and_weekend"}
