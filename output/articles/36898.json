{"title":"Racemic mixture","summary":"In chemistry, a racemic mixture, or racemate (/reɪˈsiːmeɪt, rə-, ˈræsɪmeɪt/),[1] is one that has equal amounts of left- and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule. The first known racemic mixture was racemic acid, which Louis Pasteur found to be a mixture of the two enantiomeric isomers of tartaric acid. A sample with only a single enantiomer is an enantiomerically pure or enantiopure compound.[2]","image":"Reaccion-racemato-sin-texto.png.webp","url":"Racemic_mixture"}
