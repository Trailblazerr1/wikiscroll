{"title":"Temple menorah","summary":"The menorah (/məˈnɔːrə/; Hebrew: מְנוֹרָה‎ Hebrew pronunciation: [menoˈʁa]) is described in the Bible as the seven-lamp (six branches) ancient Hebrew lampstand made of pure gold and used in the tabernacle set up by Moses in the wilderness and later in the Temple in Jerusalem. Fresh olive oil was burned daily to light its lamps. The menorah was a symbol of both Judaism and Christianity since antiquity; in modern times it is primarily considered a symbol of Judaism and is the emblem on the coat of arms of the modern state of Israel.","image":"Menorah_0307.jpg.webp"}
