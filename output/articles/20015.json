{"title":"Hemichordate","summary":"Hemichordata /ˌhɛmikɔːrˈdeɪtə/ is a phylum of marine deuterostome animals, generally considered the sister group of the echinoderms. They appear in the Lower or Middle Cambrian and include two main classes: Enteropneusta (acorn worms), and Pterobranchia. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is known only from the larva of a single species, Planctosphaera pelagica. The extinct class Graptolithina is closely related to the pterobranchs.[1]","image":"Eichelwurm_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Hemichordate"}
