{"title":"SN2 reaction","summary":"The SN2 reaction is a type of reaction mechanism that is common in organic chemistry. In this mechanism, one bond is broken and one bond is formed synchronously, i.e., in one step. SN2 is a kind of nucleophilic substitution reaction mechanism, the name referring to the Hughes-Ingold symbol of the mechanism. Since two reacting species are involved in the slow (rate-determining) step, this leads to the term substitution nucleophilic (bi-molecular) or SN2; the other major kind is SN1.[1] Many other more specialized mechanisms describe substitution reactions.","image":"SN2-MeSH-MeI-montage-3D-balls.png.webp"}
