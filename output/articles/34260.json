{"title":"Peace treaty","summary":"A peace treaty is an agreement between two or more hostile parties, usually countries or governments, which formally ends a state of war between the parties.[1] It is different from an armistice, which is an agreement to stop hostilities; a surrender, in which an army agrees to give up arms; or a ceasefire or truce, in which the parties may agree to temporarily or permanently stop fighting. The art of negotiating a peace treaty in the modern era has been referred to by legal scholar Christine Bell as the lex pacificatoria,[2] with a peace treaty potentially contributing to the legal framework governing the post conflict period, or jus post bellum.","image":"Treaty_of_Versailles%2C_English_version.jpg.webp"}
