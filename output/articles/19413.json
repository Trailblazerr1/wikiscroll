It can also refer to any cultured and learned person: \"He who says a wise thing is called a hakham, even if he be not a Jew.\"[1] Hence in Talmudic-Midrashic literature, wise gentiles are commonly called hakhmei ummot ha-'olam (\"wise men of the nations of the world\").","image":"Stefan_Luchain_Hahamul_din_Moinesti.jpg.webp","url":"Hakham"}
