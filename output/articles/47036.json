{"title":"Vaishnavism","summary":"Vaishnavism (Sanskrit: वैष्णवसम्प्रदायः, Vaiṣṇāsmpradāyaḥ) is one of the major Hindu denominations along with Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism.[1] According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Vaishnava tradition is the largest group within Hinduism, constituting about 641 million or 67.6% of Hindus.[2] It is also called Vishnuism since it considers Vishnu as the Supreme Being, i.e. Mahavishnu.[3][4]  Its followers are called Vaishnavites or Vaishnavas (IAST: Vaiṣṇava), and it also includes some other sub-sects like Krishnaism and Ramaism, which consider Krishna and Rama as the Supreme Being respectively.[5][6]","image":"Git_govind_large.jpg.webp"}
