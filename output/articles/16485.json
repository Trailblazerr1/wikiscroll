{"title":"Flocculation","summary":"Flocculation, in the field of chemistry, is a process by which colloidal particles come out of suspension to sediment under the form of floc or flake, either spontaneously or due to the addition of a clarifying agent. The action differs from precipitation in that, prior to flocculation, colloids are merely suspended, under the form of a stable dispersion, in a liquid and are not truly dissolved in solution.","image":"The_coagulation_and_filtration_processes_at_a_drinking_water_treatment_plant._(14868618507).jpg.webp"}
