{"title":"Metabolic pathway","summary":"In biochemistry, a metabolic pathway is a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell.  The reactants, products, and intermediates of an enzymatic reaction are known as metabolites, which are modified by a sequence of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.[1]: 26  In most cases of a metabolic pathway, the product of one enzyme acts as the substrate for the next. However, side products are considered waste and removed from the cell.[2] These enzymes often require dietary minerals, vitamins, and other cofactors to function.","image":"Myoglobin.png.webp","url":"Metabolic_pathway"}
