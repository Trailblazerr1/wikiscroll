{"title":"Natural History (Pliny)","summary":"The Natural History (Latin: Naturalis Historia) is a work by Pliny the Elder.  It is one of the largest single works to have survived from the Roman Empire to the modern day and purports to cover all ancient knowledge. The work's subject area is thus not limited to what is today understood by natural history; Pliny himself defines his scope as \"the natural world, or life\".[2] It is encyclopedic in scope, but its structure is not like that of a modern encyclopedia. It is the only work by Pliny to have survived, and the last that he published. He published the first 10 books in AD 77, but had not made a final revision of the remainder at the time of his death during the ADÂ 79 eruption of Vesuvius. The rest was published posthumously by Pliny's nephew, Pliny the Younger.","image":"Naturalishistoria.jpg.webp","url":"Natural_History_(Pliny)"}
