He is currently the Charles Simonyi Professor in the School of Natural Sciences at the Institute for Advanced Study.[4] Witten is a researcher in string theory, quantum gravity, supersymmetric quantum field theories, and other areas of mathematical physics. In addition to his contributions to physics, Witten's work has significantly impacted pure mathematics.[5] In 1990, he became the first physicist to be awarded a Fields Medal by the International Mathematical Union, awarded for his 1981 proof of the positive energy theorem in general relativity.[6] He is considered to be the practical founder of M-theory.[7]","image":"Edward_Witten.jpg.webp"}
