{"title":"Wheelbarrow","summary":"A wheelbarrow is a small hand-propelled vehicle, usually with just one wheel, designed to be pushed and guided by a single person using two handles at the rear, or by a sail to push the ancient wheelbarrow by wind.  The term \"wheelbarrow\" is made of two words: \"wheel\" and \"barrow.\"  \"Barrow\" is a derivation of the Old English \"barew\" which was a device used for carrying loads.","image":"2008-07-15_Construction_wheelbarrow_at_Duke.jpg.webp"}
