{"title":"Hemolytic anemia","summary":"Hemolytic anemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular).[2] This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage).[2] Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias.[2] It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects.[2] The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic.[3] Treatment depends on the type and cause of the hemolytic anemia.[2]","image":"Modified_sickle_cell_01.jpg.webp","url":"Hemolytic_anemia"}
