{"title":"Ludwig Boltzmann","summary":"Ludwig Eduard Boltzmann (German pronunciation: [ˈluːtvɪg ˈbɔlt͡sman]; 20 February 1844 – 5 September 1906) was an Austrian physicist and philosopher. His greatest achievements were the development of statistical mechanics, and the statistical explanation of the second law of thermodynamics. In 1877 he provided the current definition of entropy, S = k B ln ⁡ Ω {\\displaystyle S=k_{\\rm {B}}\\ln \\Omega \\!} , interpreted as a measure of statistical disorder of a system.[2] Max Planck named the constant kB the Boltzmann constant.[3]","image":"1350a56e364438177d82c1d84965a63ff8757770.svg","url":"Ludwig_Boltzmann"}
