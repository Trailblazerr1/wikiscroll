{"title":"Sexual consent","summary":"Sexual consent is consent to engage in sexual activity.[1][2] In many jurisdictions, sexual activity without consent is considered rape or other sexual assault.[1][2] In some, the husband has the right to have sex with his wife, who cannot refuse, and if she does the husband can rape her with impunity. In the late 1980s, academic Lois Pineau argued that society must move towards a more communicative model of sexuality so that consent becomes more explicit and clear, objective and layered, with a more comprehensive model than \"no means no\" or \"yes means yes\".[3] Many universities have instituted campaigns about consent. Creative campaigns with attention-grabbing slogans and images that market consent can be effective tools to raise awareness of campus sexual assault and related issues.[4]","image":"Kiss_at_Feb_Club_NYC_20100202.7D.02686.L1.C45.BW_SML_(4469827485).jpg.webp","url":"Sexual_consent"}
