{"title":"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away","summary":"\"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" was among the best-selling songs of the 19thÂ century, earning over $100,000 from sheet-music revenues. Written and composed by American songwriter Paul Dresser, it was published by the Tin Pan Alley firm of Howley, Haviland and Company in October 1897. The lyrics of the ballad reminisce about life near Dresser's childhood home by the Wabash River in Indiana, United States. The song remained popular for decades, and the Indiana General Assembly adopted it as the official state song on March 14, 1913. The song was the basis for a 1923 film of the same title. Its longtime popularity led to the emergence of several lyrical versions, including an 1898 anti-war song and a Swedish version that was a number-one hit.","image":"On_the_Banks_of_the_Wabash%2C_Far_Away%2C_sheet_music_cover_with_Bessie_Davis%2C_Paul_Dresser%2C_1897.jpg.webp"}
