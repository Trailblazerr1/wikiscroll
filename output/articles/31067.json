{"title":"Māori language","summary":"Māori (Māori: [ˈmaːɔɾi] (listen)), also known as te reo ('the language'), is an Eastern Polynesian language spoken by the Māori people, the indigenous population of New Zealand. Closely related to Cook Islands Māori, Tuamotuan, and Tahitian, it gained recognition as one of New Zealand's official languages in 1987. The number of speakers of the language has declined sharply since 1945,[4] but a Māori-language revitalisation effort has slowed the decline.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
