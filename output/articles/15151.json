{"title":"Esophageal achalasia","summary":"Esophageal achalasia, often referred to simply as achalasia, is a failure of smooth muscle fibers to relax, which can cause the lower esophageal sphincter to remain closed. Without a modifier, \"achalasia\" usually refers to achalasia of the esophagus. Achalasia can happen at various points along the gastrointestinal tract; achalasia of the rectum, for instance, may occur in Hirschsprung's disease. The lower esophageal sphincter is a muscle between the esophagus and stomach that opens when food comes in. It closes to avoid stomach acids from coming back up. A fully understood cause to the disease is unknown, as is factors that increase the risk of its appearance. Suggestions of a genetically transmittable form of Achalasia exist, but this is neither fully understood, nor agreed upon.[5]","image":"Achalasia2010.jpg.webp"}
