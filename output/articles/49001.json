{"title":"Wurlitzer electronic piano","summary":"The Wurlitzer electronic piano is an electric piano manufactured and marketed by Wurlitzer from the mid-1950s to the early 1980s. Sound is generated by striking a metal reed with a hammer, which induces an electric current in a pickup. It is conceptually similar to the Rhodes piano, though the sound is different.","image":"Wurlitzer_Electronic_Piano_200A%2C_Museum_of_Making_Music.jpg.webp"}
