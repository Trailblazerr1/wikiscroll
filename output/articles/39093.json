{"title":"Sale el Sol","summary":"Sale el Sol (English: The Sun Comes Out) is the ninth studio album by Colombian singer and songwriter Shakira, released on 19 October 2010, by Epic Records. The album marks a return to Shakira's signature Latin pop sound after the electropop record She Wolf (2009). The singer split the album into three musical \"directions\": a romantic side, a \"rock and roll\" side, and a \"Latino, tropical\" side.[1] The latter two \"directions\" experiment with rock and merengue music, respectively. As co-producer, Shakira enlisted collaborators including Josh Abraham, El Cata, Gustavo Cerati, John Hill, Lester Mendez, and Residente from Calle 13.","image":"Shakira_-_Sale_el_Sol_(album_cover).jpg.webp"}
