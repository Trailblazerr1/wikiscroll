{"title":"Capital city","summary":"A capital or capital city is the municipality holding primary status in a country, state, province,  department, or other administrative region, usually as its seat of the government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, different branches of government are in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction      is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place.","image":"Kashif_rahman_home.jpg.webp"}
