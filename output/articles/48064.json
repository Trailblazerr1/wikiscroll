{"title":"Wave packet","summary":"In physics, a wave packet (or wave train) is a short \"burst\" or \"envelope\" of localized wave action that travels as a unit.  A wave packet can be analyzed into, or can be synthesized from, an infinite set of component sinusoidal waves of different wavenumbers, with phases and amplitudes such that they interfere constructively only over a small region of space, and destructively elsewhere.[1] \nEach component wave function, and hence the wave packet, are solutions of a wave equation. Depending on the wave equation, the wave packet's profile may remain constant (no dispersion, see figure) or it may change (dispersion) while propagating.","image":"Wave_packet_(no_dispersion).gif"}
