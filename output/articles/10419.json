{"title":"Coda (Led Zeppelin album)","summary":"Coda is a compilation album[1] by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. The album is a collection of unused tracks from various sessions during Led Zeppelin's twelve-year career. It was released on 19 November 1982, almost two years after the group had officially disbanded following the death of drummer John Bonham. The word coda, meaning a passage that ends a musical piece following the main body, was therefore chosen as the title.","image":"Led_Zeppelin_-_Coda.jpg.webp","url":"Coda_(Led_Zeppelin_album)"}
