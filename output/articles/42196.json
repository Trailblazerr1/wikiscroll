{"title":"Steele dossier","summary":"The Steele dossier, also known as the Trumpâ€“Russia dossier,[1][2][3] is a political opposition research report written from June to December 2016 containing allegations of misconduct, conspiracy, and cooperation between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the government of Russia prior to and during the 2016 election campaign. NPR has described the controversial opposition research as an \"explosive dossier of unsubstantiated and salacious material about President Trump's alleged ties with Russia\".[3] The dossier, leaked by BuzzFeed News in January 2017[4] without its author's permission,[5][6][7][8][9] is an unfinished 35-page compilation of raw intelligence[10][11] based on information from anonymous sources known to the author, counterintelligence specialist[12] Christopher Steele.[13] Steele, a former head of the Russia Desk for British intelligence (MI6), was writing the report for the private investigative firm Fusion GPS, who were paid by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).[14] The dossier's 17 reports allege that Trump campaign members and Russian operatives had conspired to cooperate in Russia's election interference to benefit Trump.[15] It also alleges that Russia sought to damage Hillary Clinton's candidacy, including by sharing negative information about Clinton with the Trump campaign.[16] Several mainstream media outlets criticized BuzzFeed's decision to publish the reports without verifying their allegations,[17][18] while others defended its decision.[19]","image":"Donald_Trump_official_portrait_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Steele_dossier"}
