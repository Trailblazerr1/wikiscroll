{"title":"Detached object","summary":"Detached objects are a dynamical class of minor planets in the outer reaches of the Solar System and belong to the broader family of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). These objects have orbits whose points of closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) are sufficiently distant from the gravitational influence of Neptune that they are only moderately affected by Neptune and the other known planets: This makes them appear to be \"detached\" from the rest of the Solar System, except for their attraction to the Sun.[1][2]","image":"TheTransneptunians_500AU.svg.png.webp"}
