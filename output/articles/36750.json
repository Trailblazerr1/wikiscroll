{"title":"Queen Anne's Revenge","summary":"Queen Anne's Revenge was an early-18th-century ship, most famously used as a flagship by Edward Teach, better known by his nickname Blackbeard. Although the date and place of the ship's construction are uncertain,[3] it was originally believed she was built for merchant service in Bristol, England in 1710 and named Concord,[4] later captured by French privateers and renamed La Concorde. After several years' service with the French (both as a naval frigate and as a merchant vessel â€“ much of the time as a slave trading ship), she was captured by Blackbeard in 1717. Blackbeard used the ship for less than a year,[5] but captured numerous prizes using her as his flagship.","image":"Queen_Anne's_Revenge.JPG.webp"}
