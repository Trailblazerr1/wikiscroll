{"title":"Surjective function","summary":"In mathematics, a surjective function (also known as surjection, or onto function) is a function f that maps an element x to every element y; that is, for every y, there is an x such that f(x) = y. In other words, every element of the function's codomain is the image of at least one element of its domain.[1][2] It is not required that x be unique; the function f may map one or more elements of X to the same element of Y.","image":"Surjection.svg.png.webp","url":"Surjective_function"}
