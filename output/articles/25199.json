{"title":"Königsberg","summary":"Königsberg (UK: /ˈkɜːnɪɡzbɜːrɡ/, US: /ˈkeɪnɪɡzbɜːrɡ, ˈkʌn-/,[1][2][3][4] German: [ˈkøːnɪçsbɛʁk] (listen)) was the name for the historic Prussian city that is now Kaliningrad, Russia. Königsberg was founded in 1255 on the site of the ancient Old Prussian settlement Twangste by the Teutonic Knights during the Northern Crusades, and was named in honour of King Ottokar II of Bohemia.[5] A Baltic port city, it successively became the capital of their monastic state, the Duchy of Prussia (1525–1701) and East Prussia. Königsberg remained the coronation city of the Prussian monarchy, though the capital was moved to Berlin in 1701.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
