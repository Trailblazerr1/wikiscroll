{"title":"Po (river)","summary":"The Po (/poʊ/ POH, Italian: [ˈpɔ]; Latin: Padus or Ēridanus; Ancient Greek: Πάδος, romanized: Pádos, or Ἠριδανός, Ēridanós; Ancient Ligurian: Bodincus or Bodencus) is the longest river in Italy. It is a river that flows eastward across northern Italy starting from the Cottian Alps. The Po flows either 652 km (405 mi) or 682 km (424 mi) – considering the length of the Maira, a right bank tributary. The headwaters of the Po are a spring seeping from a stony hillside at Pian del Re, a flat place at the head of the Val Po under the northwest face of Monviso. The Po then extends along the 45th parallel north before ending at a delta projecting into the Adriatic Sea near Venice.","image":"Torino_-_vista_ponte_Isabella_-_Castello_del_Valentino_e_Mole_Antonelliana.jpg.webp"}
