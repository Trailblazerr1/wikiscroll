{"title":"Middle ear","summary":"The middle ear is the portion of the ear internal to the eardrum, and external to the oval window of the inner ear.  The mammalian middle ear contains three ossicles, which transfer the vibrations of the eardrum into waves in the fluid and membranes of the inner ear.  The hollow space of the middle ear is also known as the tympanic cavity and is surrounded by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The auditory tube (also known as the Eustachian tube or the pharyngotympanic tube) joins the tympanic cavity with the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), allowing pressure to equalize between the middle ear and throat.","image":"Anatomy_of_the_Human_Ear.svg.png.webp"}
