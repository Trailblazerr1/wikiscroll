{"title":"Carolina parakeet","summary":"The Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis), or Carolina conure, is an extinct species of small green neotropical parrot with a bright yellow head, reddish orange face and pale beak that was native to the eastern, Midwest and plains states of the United States. It was the only indigenous parrot within its range, as well as one of only three parrot species native to the United States (the others being the thick-billed parrot, now extirpated,[2] and the green parakeet, still present in Texas;[3] a fourth parrot species, the red-crowned amazon, is debated).[4][5][6] The Carolina parakeet was found from southern New York and Wisconsin to Kentucky, Tennessee and the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic seaboard to as far west as eastern Colorado. It lived in old-growth forests along rivers and in swamps.[7] It was called puzzi la n√©e (\"head of yellow\") or pot pot chee by the Seminole and kelinky in Chickasaw.[8] Though formerly prevalent within its range, the bird had become rare by the middle of the 19th century. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was of the ludovicianus subspecies in 1910. The last known specimen perished in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in 1918[9][10] and the species was declared extinct in 1939.","image":"Conuropsis_carolinensis_(Carolina_parakeet).jpg.webp"}
