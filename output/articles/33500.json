{"title":"Oviedo","summary":"Oviedo (UK: /ˌɒviˈeɪdoʊ/, US: /ˌoʊvi-, oʊˈvjeɪdoʊ, -ˈvjɛ-, -ðoʊ/,[2][3][4] Spanish: [oˈβjeðo]; Asturian: Uviéu [uˈβjeʊ]) is the capital city of the Principality of Asturias in northern Spain and the administrative and commercial centre of the region. It is also the name of the municipality that contains the city. Oviedo is located approximately 24 km (15 mi) southwest of Gijón[5] and 23 km (14 mi) south of Avilés,[6] both of which lie on the shoreline of the Bay of Biscay. Oviedo's proximity to the ocean of less than 30 kilometres (19 mi) in combination with its elevated position with areas of the city more than 300 metres above sea level causes the city to have a maritime climate, in spite of its not being located on the shoreline itself.","image":"Catedral_de_San_Salvador_en_Oviedo.jpg.webp","url":"Oviedo"}
