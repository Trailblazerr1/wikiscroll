{"title":"Throat","summary":"In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae. It contains the pharynx and larynx. An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs. The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords.[1][2] Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. The \"throat\" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces.[3]","image":"Throat_Diagram.png.webp","url":"Throat"}
