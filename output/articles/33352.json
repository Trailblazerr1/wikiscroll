{"title":"Orthopedic cast","summary":"An orthopedic cast, or simply cast, is a shell, frequently made from plaster or fiberglass, that encases a limb (or, in some cases, large portions of the body) to stabilize and hold anatomical structuresâ€”most often a broken bone (or bones), in place until healing is confirmed.  It is similar in function to a splint.","image":"Purple_short_leg_cast.JPG.webp","url":"Orthopedic_cast"}
