{"title":"Dartmouth College","summary":"Dartmouth College (/ˈdɑːrtməθ/ DART-məth) is a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Established in 1769 by Eleazar Wheelock, it is the ninth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[8] Although founded to educate young Native Americans in Christian theology and liberal arts, Dartmouth primarily trained Congregationalist ministers during its early history before it gradually secularized, emerging at the turn of the 20th century from relative obscurity to national prominence.[9][10][11][12][13][14][15]","image":"Dartmouth_College_shield.svg.png.webp"}
