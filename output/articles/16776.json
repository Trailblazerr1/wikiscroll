{"title":"Fowl","summary":"Fowl are birds belonging to one of two biological orders, namely the gamefowl or landfowl (Galliformes) and the waterfowl (Anseriformes). Anatomical and molecular similarities suggest these two groups are close evolutionary relatives; together, they form the fowl clade which is scientifically known as Galloanserae (initially termed Galloanseri) (Latin gallus (“rooster”) + ānser (“goose”)).[3] This clade is also supported by morphological and DNA sequence data[4] as well as retrotransposon presence/absence data.[5]","image":"Alectura_lathami_-_Centenary_Lakes.jpg.webp","url":"Fowl"}
