{"title":"Fusion power","summary":"Fusion power is a proposed form of power generation that would generate electricity by using heat from nuclear fusion reactions. In a fusion process, two lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, while releasing energy. Devices designed to harness this energy are known as fusion reactors.","image":"The_JET_magnetic_fusion_experiment_in_1991.jpg.webp","url":"Fusion_power"}
