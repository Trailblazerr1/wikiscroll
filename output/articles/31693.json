{"title":"Nervous system","summary":"In biology, the classical doctrine of the nervous system determines that  it is a highly complex part of an animal that coordinates its actions and sensory information by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events.[1] Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago. However, this classical doctrine has been challenged in recent decades by discoveries about the existence and use of electrical signals in plants.[2] On the basis of these findings, some scientists have  proposed that a plant nervous system exists and that a scientific field called plant neurobiology should be created.[3][4] This proposal has led to a dispute in the scientific community between those who think we should talk about the nervous system of plants and those who are against it.[5][6] The inflexibility of the positions in the scientific debate on both sides has led to proposing a solution to the debate, consisting of redefining the concept of the nervous system by using only physiological criteria and avoiding phylogenetic criteria.[7]","image":"TE-Nervous_system_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Nervous_system"}
