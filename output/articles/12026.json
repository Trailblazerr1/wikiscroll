{"title":"Dangerously in Love","summary":"Dangerously in Love is the debut solo studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was released on June 20, 2003, through Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment. During the recording of Destiny's Child's third studio album Survivor (2001), the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released. Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios, during the hiatus of her then-group Destiny's Child. As executive producer of the album, Beyoncé took a wider role in its production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks.","image":"Dangerously_In_Love_Album(2003).png.webp"}
