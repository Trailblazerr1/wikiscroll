{"title":"Battle of Goliad","summary":"The Battle of Goliad was the second skirmish of the Texas Revolution.  In the early-morning hours of October 9, 1835, Texas settlers attacked the Mexican Army soldiers garrisoned at Presidio La Bahía, a fort near the Mexican Texas settlement of Goliad. La Bahía lay halfway between the only other large garrison of Mexican soldiers (at Presidio San Antonio de Béxar) and the then-important Texas port of Copano.","image":"Milam_meets_Texan_troops.jpg.webp"}
