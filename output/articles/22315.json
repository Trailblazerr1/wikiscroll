{"title":"Interview","summary":"An interview is essentially a structured conversation where one participant asks questions, and the other provides answers.[1] In common parlance, the word \"interview\" refers to a one-on-one conversation between an interviewer and an interviewee.  The interviewer asks questions to which the interviewee responds, usually providing information.  That information may be used or provided to other audiences immediately or later.  This feature is common to many types of interviews – a job interview or interview with a witness to an event may have no other audience present at the time, but the answers will be later provided to others in the employment or investigative process. An interview may also transfer information in both directions.","image":"Humanités_Numériques.JPG.webp","url":"Interview"}
