{"title":"Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia","summary":"The Socialist Soviet Republic of Abkhazia (SSR Abkhazia)[lower-alpha 1] was a short-lived republic within the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union that covered the territory of Abkhazia,[lower-alpha 2] and existed from 31 March 1921 to 19 February 1931. Formed in the aftermath of the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, it was independent until 16 December 1921 when it agreed to a treaty that united it with the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic (Georgian SSR). The SSR Abkhazia was similar to an autonomous Soviet republic, though it retained nominal independence from Georgia and was given certain features only full union republics had, like its own military units. Through its status as a \"treaty republic\" with Georgia, Abkhazia joined the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which united Armenian, Azerbaijani, and Georgian SSRs into one federal unit when the latter was formed in 1922. The SSR Abkhazia was abolished in 1931 and replaced with the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Georgian SSR.","image":"Flag_of_the_SSR_Abkhazia.svg.png.webp","url":"Socialist_Soviet_Republic_of_Abkhazia"}
