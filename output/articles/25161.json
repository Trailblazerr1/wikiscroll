{"title":"Kvass","summary":"Kvass is a traditional fermented Slavic and Baltic beverage commonly made from rye bread, which is known in many Central and Eastern European and Asian[1][2] countries as \"black bread\". The colour of the bread used contributes to the colour of the resulting drink. Kvass's alcohol content from fermentation is typically low (0.5–1.0% or 1–2 proof).[3] It may be flavoured with fruits such as strawberries or raisins, or with herbs such as mint.[4] Kvass is especially popular in Russia.[5][6][7]","image":"Mint_bread_kvas.jpg.webp","url":"Kvass"}
