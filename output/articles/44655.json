{"title":"The Sun Also Rises","summary":"The Sun Also Rises is a 1926 novel by American writer Ernest Hemingway, his first, that portrays American and British expatriates who travel from Paris to the Festival of San Ferm√≠n in Pamplona to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights. An early and enduring modernist novel, it received mixed reviews upon publication. However, Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes that it is now \"recognized as Hemingway's greatest work\",[2] and Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin calls it his most important novel.[3]  The novel was published in the United States in October 1926 by Scribner's. A year later, Jonathan Cape published the novel in London under the title Fiesta. It remains in print.","image":"The_Sun_Also_Rises_(1st_ed._cover).jpg.webp","url":"The_Sun_Also_Rises"}
