{"title":"Organizational culture","summary":"Historically there have been differences among investigators regarding the definition of organizational culture. Edgar H. Schein, a leading researcher in this field, defined \"organizational culture\" as comprising a number of features, including a shared \"pattern of basic assumptions\" which group members have acquired over time as they learn to successfully cope with internal and external organizationally relevant problems.[1] Elliott Jaques first introduced the concept of culture in the organizational context in his 1951 book The Changing Culture of a Factory.[2] The book was a published report of \"a case study of developments in the social life of one industrial community between April, 1948 and November 1950\".[3] The \"case\" involved a publicly-held British company engaged principally in the manufacture, sale, and servicing of metal bearings. The study concerned itself with the description, analysis, and development of corporate group behaviours.[4]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Organizational_culture"}
