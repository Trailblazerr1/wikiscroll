{"title":"Ligand-gated ion channel","summary":"Ligand-gated ion channels (LICs, LGIC), also commonly referred to as ionotropic receptors, are a group of transmembrane ion-channel proteins which open to allow ions such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and/or Clâˆ’ to pass through the membrane in response to the binding of a chemical messenger (i.e. a ligand), such as a neurotransmitter.[1][2][3]","image":"LGIC.png.webp","url":"Ligand-gated_ion_channel"}
