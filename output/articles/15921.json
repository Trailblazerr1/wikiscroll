{"title":"Federalisation of the European Union","summary":"The federalisation of the European Union describes processes and proposals by which the European Union (EU) could be transformed from an informal confederation (a union of sovereign states) into a federation (a single federal state with a central government, consisting of a number of partially self-governing federated states). There is ongoing discussion about the extent to which the EU has already become a federation over the course of decades, and more importantly, to what degree it should continue to evolve into a federalist direction. As of October 2021, the EU has no formal plans to become a federation.","image":"EU_single_entity.PNG.webp","url":"Federalisation_of_the_European_Union"}
