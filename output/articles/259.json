{"title":"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)","summary":"1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?) is the debut studio album by British electronic band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (the JAMs), later known as the KLF. 1987 was produced using extensive unauthorised samples that plagiarised a wide range of musical works, continuing a theme begun in the JAMs' debut single \"All You Need Is Love\". These samples provided a deliberately provocative backdrop for beatbox rhythms and cryptic, political raps.","image":"The_JAMS-_1987_(What_The_Fuck_Is_Going_On%3F).jpg.webp","url":"1987_(What_the_Fuck_Is_Going_On?)"}
