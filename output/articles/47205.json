{"title":"Veganism","summary":"Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.[lower-alpha 3] An individual who follows the diet or philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans, also known as \"strict vegetarians\", refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances.[lower-alpha 4] An ethical vegan is someone who not only follows a plant-based diet but extends the philosophy into other areas of their lives, opposes the use of animals for any purpose,[lower-alpha 5] and tries to avoid any cruelty and exploitation of all animals including humans.[23] Another term is \"environmental veganism\", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.[24]","image":"Vegan_friendly_icon.svg.png.webp","url":"Veganism"}
