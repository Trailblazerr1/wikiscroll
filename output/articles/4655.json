{"title":"Assam tea","summary":"Assam tea is a black tea named after the region of its production, Assam, India. Assam tea is manufactured specifically from the plant Camellia sinensis var. assamica (Masters).[1][2] Assam tea is indigenous to Assam. Initial efforts of planting Chinese varieties in Assam soil did not succeed.[3][4] Although Assam tea is now mostly grown at or near sea level and is known for its body, briskness, malty flavour, and strong, bright colour. Assam teas, or blends containing Assam, are often sold as \"breakfast\" teas. For instance, Irish breakfast tea, a maltier and stronger breakfast tea, consists of small-sized Assam tea leaves.[5]","image":"Assam-Tee_SFTGFOP1.jpg.webp"}
