{"title":"Ibadi Islam","summary":"The Ibadi movement (also called Ibāḍiyya (Arabic: الإباضية‎, romanized: al-Ibāḍiyyah) and Ibadism), is a school of Islam.[1] It exists in Oman, Algeria, Tunisia, and East Africa. Ibadi Islam traces the origins of the denomination to a moderate current of the Khawarij movement;[2][3][4] contemporary Ibāḍīs strongly object to being classified as Kharijites, although they recognize that their movement originated with the Kharijite secession of 657 CE.[4] The followers of Ibadi Islam are known as the Ibadis.","image":"Muhakkimite_Creed.png.webp","url":"Ibadi_Islam"}
