{"title":"Ferrocene","summary":"Ferrocene is an organometallic compound with the formula Fe(C5H5)2. The molecule is a complex consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings bound to a central iron atom. It is an orange solid with a camphor-like odor, that sublimes above room temperature, and is soluble in most organic solvents.  It is remarkable for its stability: it is unaffected by air, water, strong bases, and can be heated to 400 °C without decomposition.  In oxidizing conditions it can reversibly react with strong acids to form the ferrocenium cation Fe(C5H5)+2.[9]","image":"Ferrocene.svg.png.webp","url":"Ferrocene"}
