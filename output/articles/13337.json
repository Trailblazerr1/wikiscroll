{"title":"Domestic turkey","summary":"The domestic turkey (Meleagris gallopavo domesticus) is a large fowl, one of the two species in the genus Meleagris and the same species as the wild turkey. Although turkey domestication was thought to have occurred in central Mesoamerica at least 2,000 years ago,[1] recent research suggests a possible second domestication event in the area that is now the southwestern United States between 200 BC and AD 500.  However, all of the main domestic turkey varieties today descend from the turkey raised in central Mexico that was subsequently imported into Europe by the Spanish in the 16th century.[2]","image":"Male_north_american_turkey_supersaturated.jpg.webp","url":"Domestic_turkey"}
