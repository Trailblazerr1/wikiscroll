{"title":"Vine (service)","summary":"Vine was an American social networking short-form video hosting service where users could share six-second-long, looping video clips. It was founded in June 2012; American microblogging website Twitter acquired it in October 2012, before its official release on January 24, 2013. Videos published on Vine's social network could also be shared on different social networking platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. The Vine app was also used to try to browse videos, along with a group of videos that were uploaded by theme, and hoping that users could \"trend\" videos. Vine competed with other social media services such as Instagram and Pheed.","image":"Vine_wordmark.svg.png.webp","url":"Vine_(service)"}
