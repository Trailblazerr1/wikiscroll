{"title":"Uranus (mythology)","summary":"In Greek mythology, Uranus (/ˈjʊərənəs, jʊˈreɪnəs/ (listen) YOOR-ə-nəs, yuu-RAY-nəs),[3] sometimes written Ouranos (Ancient Greek: Οὐρανός, lit. 'sky', [uːranós]), is the personification of the sky and one of the Greek primordial deities. According to Hesiod, Uranus was the son and husband of Gaia (Earth), with whom he fathered the first generation of Titans. However, no cult addressed directly to Uranus survived into Classical times,[4] and Uranus does not appear among the usual themes of Greek painted pottery. Elemental Earth, Sky, and Styx might be joined, however, in solemn invocation in Homeric epic.[5] Uranus is associated with the Roman god Caelus.[6][7][8]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
