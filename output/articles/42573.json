{"title":"Subatomic particle","summary":"In physical sciences, a subatomic particle  is a particle that is smaller than an atom.[1] According to the Standard Model of particle physics, a subatomic particle can be either a composite particle, which is composed of other particles (for example, a proton, neutron, or meson), or an elementary particle, which is not composed of other particles (for example, an electron, photon, or muon).[2] Particle physics and nuclear physics study these particles and how they interact.[3]","image":"Standard_Model_of_Elementary_Particles.svg.png.webp","url":"Subatomic_particle"}
