{"title":"Photophosphorylation","summary":"In the process of photosynthesis, the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP using the energy of sunlight is called photophosphorylation.  Cyclic photophosphorylation occurs in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Only two sources of energy are available to living organisms: sunlight and reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions.  All organisms produce ATP, which is the universal energy currency of life. In photosynthesis this commonly involves photolysis, or photodissociation, of water and a continuous unidirectional flow of electrons from water to photosystem II.","image":"Thylakoid_membrane_3.svg.png.webp"}
