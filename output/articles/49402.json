{"title":"Zamzam Well","summary":"The Zamzam Well (Arabic: بِئْرُ زَمْزَمَ‎) is a well located within the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is 20 m (66 ft) east of the Kaaba,[2] the holiest place in Islam. According to Islam, the well is a miraculously generated source of water from Allah, which sprang spontaneously thousands of years ago when Ibrahim's (Abraham's) son ʾIsmaʿil (Ishmael) was left with his mother Hajar (Hagar) in the desert, thirsty and crying. Millions of pilgrims visit the well each year while performing the Hajj or Umrah pilgrimages in order to drink its water.","image":"بئر_زمزم_الأثري.jpg.webp","url":"Zamzam_Well"}
