{"title":"Cormorant","summary":"Phalacrocoracidae is a family of approximately 40 species of aquatic birds commonly known as cormorants and shags. Several different classifications of the family have been proposed, but in 2021 the IOC adopted a consensus taxonomy of seven genera.[1][2] The great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and the common shag (Gulosus aristotelis) are the only two species of the family commonly encountered in Britain and Ireland[3] and \"cormorant\" and \"shag\" appellations have been later assigned to different species in the family somewhat haphazardly.","image":"Microcarbo_melanoleucos_Austins_Ferry_3.jpg.webp"}
