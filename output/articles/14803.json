{"title":"Endometrium","summary":"The endometrium is the inner epithelial layer, along with its mucous membrane, of the mammalian uterus.  It has a basal layer and a functional layer; the functional layer thickens and then is shed during menstruation in humans and some other mammals, including apes, Old World monkeys, some species of bat, the elephant shrew[1] and the Cairo spiny mouse.[2] In most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed in the estrous cycle. During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.[3][4] The speculated presence of an endometrial microbiota[5]\nhas been argued against.[6][7]","image":"Basic_Female_Reproductive_System_(English).svg.png.webp"}
