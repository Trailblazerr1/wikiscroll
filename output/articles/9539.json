{"title":"Chevrolet Bel Air","summary":"The Chevrolet Bel Air is a full-size car that was produced by Chevrolet for the 1950â€“1975 model years. Initially, only the two-door hardtops in the Chevrolet model range were designated with the Bel Air name from 1950 to 1952. With the 1953 model year, the Bel Air name was changed from a designation for a unique body shape to a premium level of trim applied across a number of body styles. The Bel Air continued with various other trim level designations, and it went from a mid-level trim car to a budget fleet sedan when U.S. production ceased in 1975. Production continued in Canada, for its home market only, through the 1981 model year.","image":"57_Chevy_BelAir.jpg.webp"}
