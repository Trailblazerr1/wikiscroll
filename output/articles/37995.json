{"title":"Ring finger","summary":"The ring finger is the fourth digit of a human hand. It is located between the pinkie and the middle finger. It is so named for its traditional association with wedding rings in many cultures, though not all cultures use this digit as the ring finger. In some cultures, the wedding ring is worn on the \"ring finger\" of the left hand and in others it is on the right hand. Traditionally, a wedding ring was worn only by the bride/wife, but in recent times more men also wear a wedding ring. It is also the custom in some cultures to wear an engagement ring on the ring finger.","image":"Ringvinger.jpg.webp","url":"Ring_finger"}
