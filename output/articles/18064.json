{"title":"Gibbs free energy","summary":"In thermodynamics, the Gibbs free energy (or Gibbs energy) is a thermodynamic potential that can be used to calculate the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure.  The Gibbs free energy (\n  \n    \n      \n        Δ\n        G\n        =\n        Δ\n        H\n        −\n        T\n        Δ\n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta G=\\Delta H-T\\Delta S}\n  \n, measured in joules in SI) is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter). This maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces.[1]","image":"062377921bd620d44f679e76b7fc687d07ce2c79.svg"}
