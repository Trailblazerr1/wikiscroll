{"title":"systemd","summary":"systemd is a software suite that provides an array of system components for Linux[6] operating systems. Its main aim is to unify service configuration and behavior across Linux distributions;[7] systemd's primary component is a \"system and service manager\"â€”an init system used to bootstrap user space and manage user processes. It also  provides replacements for various daemons and utilities, including device management, login management, network connection management, and event logging. The name systemd adheres to the Unix convention of naming daemons by appending the letter d.[8] It also plays on the term \"System D\", which refers to a person's ability to adapt quickly and improvise to solve problems.[9]","image":"Systemd-logo.svg.png.webp"}
