{"title":"USS Arizona (BB-39)","summary":"USS Arizona (BB-39) was the second and last of the  Pennsylvania-class of \"super-dreadnought\" battleships built for the United States Navy in the mid-1910s. Named in honor of the 48th state's recent admission into the union and commissioned in 1916, the ship remained stateside during World War I. Shortly after the end of the war, Arizona was one of a number of American ships that briefly escorted President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference. The ship was sent to Turkey in 1919 at the beginning of the Greco-Turkish War to represent American interests for several months. Several years later, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and remained there for the rest of her career.","image":"Arizona_(BB39)_Port_Bow%2C_Underway_-_NARA_-_5900075_-_1930.jpg.webp","url":"USS_Arizona_(BB-39)"}
