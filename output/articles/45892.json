{"title":"Trench warfare","summary":"Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines largely comprising military trenches, in which troops are well-protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. Trench warfare became archetypically associated with World War I (1914–1918), when the Race to the Sea rapidly expanded trench use on the Western Front starting in September 1914.[1]","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_136-B0560%2C_Frankreich%2C_Kavalleristen_im_Schützengraben.jpg.webp","url":"Trench_warfare"}
