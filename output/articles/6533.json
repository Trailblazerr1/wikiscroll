{"title":"Bill Brown (cricketer)","summary":"William Alfred Brown, OAM (31 July 1912 â€“ 16 March 2008) was an Australian cricketer who played 22 Test matches between 1934 and 1948, captaining his country in one Test. A right-handed opening batsman, his partnership with Jack Fingleton in the 1930s is regarded as one of the finest in Australian Test history.[1] After the interruption of World War II, Brown was a member of the team dubbed \"The Invincibles\", who toured England in 1948 without defeat under the leadership of Don Bradman. In a match in November 1947, Brown was the unwitting victim of the first instance of \"Mankading\".","image":"BillBrown2.jpg.webp","url":"Bill_Brown_(cricketer)"}
