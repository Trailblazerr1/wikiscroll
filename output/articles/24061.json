{"title":"Judaism","summary":"Judaism is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, and ethnic religion comprising the collective religious, cultural, and legal tradition and civilization of the Jewish people.[6][1][7] It has its roots as an organized religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age.[8] Modern Judaism evolved from Yahwism, the religion of ancient Israel and Judah, by around 500 BCE,[9] and is thus considered to be one of the oldest monotheistic religions.[10][11] Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Israelites, their ancestors.[12] It encompasses a wide body of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization.","image":"Judaica.jpg.webp"}
