{"title":"Purdah","summary":"Pardah or purdah (from Persian: پرده‎, meaning \"curtain\") is a religious and social practice of female seclusion prevalent among some Muslim and Hindu communities.[1] It takes two forms: physical segregation of the sexes and the requirement that women cover their bodies so as to cover their skin and conceal their form. A woman who practices purdah can be referred to as pardanashin or purdahnishan. The term purdah is sometimes applied to similar practices in other parts of the world.","image":"Afghan_lady_in_Kabul.jpg.webp"}
