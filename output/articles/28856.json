{"title":"Mastering (audio)","summary":"Mastering, a form of audio post production, is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the final mix to a data storage device (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or replication). In recent years digital masters have become usual, although analog masters—such as audio tapes—are still being used by the manufacturing industry, particularly by a few engineers who specialize in analog mastering.","image":"Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg.webp","url":"Mastering_(audio)"}
