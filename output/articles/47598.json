{"title":"Vision (Marvel Comics)","summary":"The Vision is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Roy Thomas and artist John Buscema,[1][2] the character first appeared in The Avengers #57 (published in August 1968, with a cover date of October 1968), and is loosely based on the Timely Comics character of the same name who was an alien from another dimension. The Vision is an android (sometimes called a \"synthezoid\") built by the villainous robot Ultron created by Hank Pym. Originally intended to act as Ultron's \"son\" and destroy the Avengers, Vision instead turned on his creator and joined the Avengers to fight for the forces of good. Since then, he has been depicted as a frequent member of the team, and for a time was married to his teammate, the Scarlet Witch. He also served as a member of the Defenders.","image":"Avengers_Vol_4_24.1.jpg.webp","url":"Vision_(Marvel_Comics)"}
