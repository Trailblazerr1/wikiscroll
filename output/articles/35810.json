{"title":"Precious metal","summary":"Precious metals  are rare, naturally occurring metallic chemical elements of high economic value. Chemically, the precious metals tend to be less reactive than most elements (see noble metal). They are usually ductile and have a high lustre. Historically, precious metals were important as currency but are now regarded mainly as investment and industrial commodities. Gold, silver, platinum, and palladium each have an ISO 4217 currency code.","image":"GoldNuggetUSGOV.jpg.webp","url":"Precious_metal"}
