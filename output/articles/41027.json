{"title":"Smile (The Beach Boys album)","summary":"Smile (stylized as SMiLE) is an unfinished album by the American rock band the Beach Boys that was planned to follow their 11th studio album Pet Sounds (1966).  It was to be a 12-track LP that drew from over 50 hours of interchangeable sound fragments, similar to the group's 1966 single \"Good Vibrations\". Instead, after a year of recording, the album was shelved and the group released a downscaled version, Smiley Smile, in September 1967. Over the next four decades, few of the original Smile tracks were officially released, and the project came to be regarded as the most \"legendary\" unreleased album in popular music history.[11][12]","image":"Beachboyssmile.png.webp","url":"Smile_(The_Beach_Boys_album)"}
