{"title":"Rhyolite","summary":"Rhyolite (/ˈraɪ.əlaɪt/ RY-ə-lyte)[1][2][3][4] is the most silica-rich of volcanic rocks. It is generally glassy or fine-grained (aphanitic) in texture, but may be porphyritic, containing larger mineral crystals (phenocrysts) in an otherwise fine-grained groundmass. The mineral assemblage is predominantly quartz, sanidine, and plagioclase. It is the extrusive equivalent to granite.","image":"lossy-page1-220px-PinkRhyolite.tif.jpg.webp"}
