{"title":"Ancient astronauts","summary":"\"Ancient astronauts\" (or \"ancient aliens\") refers to a pseudoscientific hypothesis,[1][2][3][4] that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity and prehistoric times.[1][2][4] Proponents suggest that this contact influenced the development of modern cultures, technologies, religions, and human biology.[1][2] A common position is that deities from most, if not all, religions are extraterrestrial in origin, and that advanced technologies brought to Earth by ancient astronauts were interpreted as evidence of divine status by early humans.[1][2][5]","image":"Antropomorfi_detti_astronauti_(b)_-_R_1_-_Area_di_Zurla_-_Nadro_(ph_Luca_Giarelli).jpg.webp"}
