{"title":"Modem","summary":"A modulator-demodulator, or simply modem, is a computer hardware device that converts data from a digital format into a format suitable for an analog  such as telephone or radio. A modem transmits data by modulating one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information, while the receiver demodulates the signal to recreate the original digital information. The goal is to produce a electrical signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals, from light-emitting diodes to radio.","image":"Analogue_modem_-_acoustic_coupler.jpg.webp","url":"Modem"}
