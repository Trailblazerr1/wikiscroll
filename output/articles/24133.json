{"title":"Julius Nepos","summary":"Julius Nepos (died 9 May 480),[lower-alpha 2] also known as just Nepos,[7][8] ruled as Roman emperor of the West from 24 June 474 to 28 August 475.[7] After losing power in Italy, Nepos retreated to his home province of Dalmatia, from which he continued to claim the western imperial title, with recognition from the Eastern Roman Empire, until he was murdered in 480. Though that distinction is most often awarded to Nepos' successor in Italy, Romulus Augustulus (r. 475–476), Nepos is regarded by some historians as the last western Roman emperor, being the last widely recognised claimant to the position.","image":"Solidus_of_Julius_Nepos.png.webp","url":"Julius_Nepos"}
