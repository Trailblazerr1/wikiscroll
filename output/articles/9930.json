{"title":"Chromatic aberration","summary":"In optics, chromatic aberration (CA), also called chromatic distortion and spherochromatism, is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same point.[1] It is caused by dispersion: the refractive index of the lens elements varies with the wavelength of light. The refractive index of most transparent materials decreases with increasing wavelength.[2] Since the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index, this variation in refractive index affects focusing.[3] Chromatic aberration manifests itself as \"fringes\" of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image.","image":"Out-of-focus_image_of_a_spoke_target..svg.png.webp"}
