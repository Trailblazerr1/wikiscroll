{"title":"Lieutenant Governor (Canada)","summary":"In Canada, a lieutenant governor (/lɛfˈtɛnənt/; French [masculine]: lieutenant-gouverneur, or [feminine]: lieutenant-gouverneure) is the viceregal representative in a provincial jurisdiction of the Canadian monarch and head of state, Queen Elizabeth II. On the advice of his or her prime minister, the Governor General of Canada appoints the lieutenant governors to carry out most of the monarch's constitutional and ceremonial duties for an unfixed period of time[1]—known as serving at Her Excellency's pleasure—though five years is the normal convention. Similar positions in Canada's three territories are termed Commissioners and are representatives of the federal government, not the monarch directly.","image":"St_Edward's_Crown_with_maple_leaves.svg.png.webp","url":"Lieutenant_Governor_(Canada)"}
