{"title":"Wedge-tailed eagle","summary":"The wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) is the largest bird of prey in the continent of Australia. It is also found in southern New Guinea to the north and is distributed as far south as the state of Tasmania.[1] This very large but fairly lanky eagle has long, fairly broad wings, fully feathered legs, and an unmistakable wedge-shaped tail, with very elongated, strong beak and quite powerful feet.[3] The wedge-tailed eagle is one of 12 species of large, predominantly dark-coloured booted eagles in the genus Aquila found worldwide. Genetic research has clearly indicated that the wedge-tailed eagle is fairly closely-related to other, generally quite large members of the Aquila genus.[4] A large brown-to-black bird of prey, it has a maximum reported wingspan of 2.84 m (9 ft 4 in) and a length of up to 1.06 m (3 ft 6 in).[5] The wedge-tailed eagle is one of its native continent’s most generalized birds of prey.[6] They reside in most habitats present in Australia, ranging from desert and semi-desert to plains to mountainous areas to forest, even sometimes tropical rainforests. Preferred habitats, however, tend towards those that have a fairly varied topography including rocky areas, some open terrain and native woodlots such as Eucalyptus stands.[6][7]","image":"Wedge_tail_eagle_flight_Jan13.jpg.webp","url":"Wedge-tailed_eagle"}
