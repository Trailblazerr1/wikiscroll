{"title":"Jalapeño","summary":"The jalapeño (UK: /ˌhæləˈpeɪnjoʊ/ HAL-ə-PAY-nyoh, US: /ˌhɑːl-/ HAHL-,[1][2][3] Spanish: [xalaˈpeɲo] (listen)) is a medium-sized chile pepper pod type cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum.[4] A mature jalapeño chile is 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long and hangs down with a round, firm, smooth flesh of 25–38 mm (1–1+1⁄2 in) wide. It can have a range of pungency, with Scoville heat units of 3,500 to 8,000.[5] Commonly picked and consumed while still green, it is occasionally allowed to fully ripen and turn red, orange, or yellow. It is wider and generally milder than the similar Serrano pepper.[6]","image":"Immature_jalapeno_capsicum_annuum_var_annuum.jpeg.webp","url":"Jalapeño"}
