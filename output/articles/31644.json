{"title":"Neo-orthodoxy","summary":"Neo-orthodoxy or Neoorthodoxy, in Christianity, also known as theology of crisis and dialectical theology,[1] was a theological movement developed in the aftermath of the First World War.  The movement was largely a reaction against doctrines of 19th-century liberal theology and a reevaluation of the teachings of the Reformation.[2] Karl Barth is the leading figure associated with the movement. In the U.S., Reinhold Niebuhr was a leading exponent of neo-orthodoxy.[3]  It is unrelated to Eastern orthodoxy.","image":"Golden_Christian_Cross.svg.png.webp"}
