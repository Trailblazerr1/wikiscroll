{"title":"Basel III","summary":"Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord or Basel Standards) is a global, voluntary regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk. This third installment of the Basel Accords (see Basel I, Basel II) was developed in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the financial crisis of 2007â€“08. It is intended to strengthen bank capital requirements by increasing minimum capital requirements, holdings of high quality liquid assets,  and decreasing bank leverage.","image":"a5e88a2bdfc26c32b16cd44976b2dbbb8d3315d9.svg"}
