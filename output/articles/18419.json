{"title":"Gonadotropin","summary":"Gonadotropins are glycoprotein hormones secreted by gonadotropic cells of the anterior pituitary of vertebrates.[1][2][3] This family includes the mammalian hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the placental/chorionic gonadotropins, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG),[3] as well as at least two forms of fish gonadotropins. These hormones are central to the complex endocrine system that regulates normal growth, sexual development, and reproductive function.[4] LH and FSH are secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, while hCG and eCG are secreted by the placenta in pregnant humans and mares, respectively.[5] The gonadotropins act on the gonads, controlling gamete and sex hormone production.","image":"Gonadotropin_releasing_hormone3d.png.webp","url":"Gonadotropin"}
