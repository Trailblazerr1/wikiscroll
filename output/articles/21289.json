{"title":"Hypergeometric function","summary":"In mathematics, the Gaussian or ordinary hypergeometric function 2F1(a,b;c;z) is a special function represented by the hypergeometric series, that includes many other special functions as specific or limiting cases. It is a solution of a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE). Every second-order linear ODE with three regular singular points can be transformed into this equation.","image":"99e0c2fc98e65d9c5dbe3f8061bcf45d100f84d2.svg"}
