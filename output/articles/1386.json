{"title":"New York Yankees","summary":"The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the National League's (NL) New York Mets. The Yankees began play in the 1901 season as the Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). In 1903, Frank Farrell and Bill Devery purchased the franchise after it ceased operations and moved it to New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders.[3] The Highlanders were officially renamed the New York Yankees in 1913.[4]","image":"Baseball_current_event.svg.png.webp","url":"A%2fNew_York_Yankees"}
