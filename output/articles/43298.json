{"title":"Taiwanese indigenous peoples","summary":"Taiwanese indigenous peoples (formerly Taiwanese aborigines), Formosan people, Austronesian Taiwanese,[2][3] Yuanzhumin or Gaoshan people,[4] are the indigenous peoples of Taiwan, who number about 569,000 or 2.38% of the island's population. This total is increased to more than 800,000 people if the indigenous peoples of the plains in Taiwan are included, pending future official recognition. Recent research suggests their ancestors may have been living on Taiwan for approximately 6,500 years. A wide body of evidence suggests Taiwan's indigenous people maintained regular trade networks with regional cultures before major Han (Chinese) immigration from continental Asia began in the 17th century.[5][6]","image":"08.15_總統出席「2016三地門鄉聯合收穫祭」_(28706865630).jpg.webp","url":"Taiwanese_indigenous_peoples"}
