{"title":"Swift fox","summary":"The swift fox (Vulpes velox) is a small light orange-tan fox around the size of a domestic cat found in the western grasslands of North America, such as Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma[3]  and Texas.[1] It also lives in southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta in Canada, where it was previously extirpated.[2] It is closely related to the kit fox and the two species are sometimes known as subspecies of Vulpes velox because hybrids of the two species occur naturally where their ranges overlap.","image":"Swift_Fox_Colorado_Wolf_and_Wildlife_cropped.jpg.webp"}
