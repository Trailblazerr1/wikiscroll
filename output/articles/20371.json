{"title":"Hippie","summary":"A hippie, also spelled hippy,[1] especially in UK English,[2] was a member of the counterculture of the 1960s, originally a youth movement that began in the United States during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world.[3] The word hippie came from hipster and was used to describe beatniks[4] who moved into New York City's Greenwich Village, San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district, and Chicago's Old Town community. The term hippie was used in print by San Francisco writer Michael Fallon, helping popularise use of the term in the media, although the tag was seen elsewhere earlier.[5][6]","image":"Woodstock-kids.jpg.webp","url":"Hippie"}
