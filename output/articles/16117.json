{"title":"Fifth Dimension (album)","summary":"Fifth Dimension is the third album by the American folk rock band the Byrds and was released in July 1966 on Columbia Records.[1][2] Most of the album was recorded following the February 1966 departure of the band's principal songwriter Gene Clark.[3][4] In an attempt to compensate for Clark's absence, guitarists Jim McGuinn and David Crosby stepped into the breach and increased their songwriting output.[5] In spite of this, the loss of Clark resulted in an album with a total of four cover versions and an instrumental, which critics have described as \"wildly uneven\" and \"awkward and scattered\".[2][3] However, the album is notable for being the first by the Byrds not to include any songs written by Bob Dylan, whose material had previously been a mainstay of the band's repertoire.[3]","image":"5DCover.jpg.webp","url":"Fifth_Dimension_(album)"}
