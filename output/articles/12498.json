{"title":"Delayed sleep phase disorder","summary":"Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), more often known as delayed sleep phase syndrome and also as delayed sleepâ€“wake phase disorder, is a chronic dysregulation of a person's circadian rhythm (biological clock), compared to those of the general population and societal norms. The disorder affects the timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the core body temperature, rhythm, hormonal as well as other daily cycles. People with DSPD generally fall asleep some hours after midnight and have difficulty waking up in the morning.[1] People with DSPD probably have a circadian period significantly longer than 24 hours.[2] Depending on the severity, the symptoms can be managed to a greater or lesser degree, but no cure is known, and research suggests a genetic origin for the disorder.[3]","image":"DSPS_biorhytm.jpg.webp","url":"Delayed_sleep_phase_disorder"}
