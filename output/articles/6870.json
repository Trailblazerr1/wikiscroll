{"title":"Blacksmith","summary":"A blacksmith is a metalsmith who creates objects primarily from wrought iron or steel, but sometimes from other metals, by forging the metal, using tools to hammer, bend, and cut (cf. tinsmith). Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons. There was an historical opposition between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operation of a whitesmith, who usually worked in gold, silver, pewter, or the finishing steps of fine steel.[1] The place where a blacksmith works is called variously a smithy, a forge or a blacksmith's shop.","image":"Kovář_při_práci_(Velikonoční_trhy_na_Václavském_náměstí)_055.jpg.webp","url":"Blacksmith"}
