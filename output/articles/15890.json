{"title":"Febrile seizure","summary":"A febrile seizure, also known as a fever fit or febrile convulsion, is a seizure associated with a high body temperature but without any serious underlying health issue.[1] They most commonly occur in children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years.[1][3] Most seizures are less than five minutes in duration, and the child is completely back to normal within an hour of the event.[1][4] There are two types: simple febrile seizures and complex febrile seizures.[1] Simple febrile seizures involve an otherwise healthy child who has at most one tonic-clonic seizure lasting less than 15 minutes in a 24-hour period.[1] Complex febrile seizures have focal symptoms, last longer than 15 minutes, or occur more than once within 24 hours.[5] About 80% are classified as simple febrile seizures.[6]","image":"Clinical_thermometer_38.7.JPG.webp"}
