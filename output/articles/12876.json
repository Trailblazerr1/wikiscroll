{"title":"Diapsid","summary":"Diapsids (\"two arches\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period.[1] The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodilians, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and birds.[2] Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 17,084 species of diapsid animals are extant: 9,159 birds,[3] and 7,925 snakes, lizards, tuatara, turtles, and crocodiles.[4]","image":"Petrolacosaurus_BW.jpg.webp","url":"Diapsid"}
