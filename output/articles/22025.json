{"title":"Inner product space","summary":"In mathematics, an inner product space (or, rarely, a Hausdorff pre-Hilbert space[1][2]) is a real vector space or a complex vector space with a binary operation called an inner product.  The inner product of two vectors in the space is a scalar, often denoted with angle brackets, as in \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟨\n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle a,b\\rangle }\n  \n. Inner products allow formal definitions of intuitive geometric notions, such as lengths, angles, and orthogonality (zero inner product) of vectors. Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean vector spaces, in which the inner product is the dot product or scalar product of Cartesian coordinates.[3] Inner product spaces of infinite dimension are widely used in functional analysis. Inner product spaces over the field of complex numbers are sometimes referred to as unitary spaces. The first usage of the concept of a vector space with an inner product is due to Giuseppe Peano, in 1898.[4]","image":"59f9c6fc93d2e4195b610bc8a9ff366be4485387.svg"}
