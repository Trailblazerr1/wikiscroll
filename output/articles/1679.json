{"title":"A3 road","summary":"The A3, known as the Portsmouth Road or London Road in sections, is a major road connecting the City of London and Portsmouth passing close to Kingston upon Thames, Guildford, Haslemere and Petersfield. For much of its 67-mile (108Â km) length, it is classified as a trunk road and therefore managed by Highways England. Almost all of the road has been built to dual carriageway standards or wider.  Apart from bypass sections in London, the road travels in a southwest direction and, after Liss, south-southwest.","image":"UK_road_A3.svg.png.webp"}
