{"title":"Nepali language","summary":"Nepali (English: /nɪˈpɔːli/;[3] Devanagari: नेपाली, [ˈnepali]) is an Indo-Aryan language of the sub-branch of Eastern Pahari. It is the official language at the federal level in Nepal and one of the 22 scheduled languages of India due to the Nepalese community in the Northeast. It is spoken throughout Nepal and by about a quarter of the population in Bhutan.[4] In India, Nepali has official status in the state of Sikkim and in the Darjeeling District and Kalimpong district of West Bengal. It has a significant number of speakers in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and Uttarakhand. It is also spoken in Myanmar and by the Nepali diaspora in the Middle East and worldwide.[5] Nepali developed in proximity to a number of Indo-Aryan languages, most notably the other Pahari languages. Historically, Sanskrit is the most significant source of vocabulary for the Nepali language.[6] According to exclusive phonological evidences observed by lexicographer Sir Ralph Turner, Nepali language is closely related to Punjabi, Lahnda, Hindi and Kumaoni while it appears to share some distinguishing features with the other Indo-Aryan languages like Rajasthani, Gujarati and Bangla.[6] Ethnologist Brian Houghton Hodgson stated that the Khas or Parbattia language is an \"Indian Prakrit\" brought by colonies from south of the Nepalese hills, and the whole structure including the eigth-tenth portion of the vocabulary of it is \"substantially Hindee\".[7]","image":"Nepali_word_in_devanagiri.svg.png.webp"}
