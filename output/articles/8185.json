{"title":"Cain and Abel","summary":"In the biblical Book of Genesis, Cain[lower-alpha 1] and Abel[lower-alpha 2] are the first two sons of Adam and Eve.[1] Cain, the firstborn, was a farmer, and his brother Abel was a shepherd. The brothers made sacrifices to God, but God favored Abel's sacrifice instead of Cain's. Cain then murdered Abel out of jealousy, whereupon God punished Cain by condemning him to a life of wandering. Cain then dwelt in the land of Nod (נוֹד‎, 'wandering'), where he built a city and fathered the line of descendants beginning with Enoch.","image":"Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Cain_slaying_Abel_(Courtauld_Institute).jpg.webp","url":"Cain_and_Abel"}
