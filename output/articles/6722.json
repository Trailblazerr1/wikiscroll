{"title":"Birth","summary":"Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring,[1] also referred to in technical contexts as parturition. In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe.","image":"Lambing_in_England_-10March2012_(2).jpg.webp","url":"Birth"}
