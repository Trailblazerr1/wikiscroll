{"title":"Mitochondrion","summary":"A mitochondrion (/ˌmaɪtəˈkɒndriən/;[1] pl. mitochondria) is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondria generate most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.[2] They were first discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1880 in the voluntary muscles of insects. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the \"powerhouse of the cell\", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.[3]","image":"Mitochondria%2C_mammalian_lung_-_TEM.jpg.webp"}
