{"title":"Lincoln's House Divided Speech","summary":"The House Divided Speech was an address given by Abraham Lincoln, later President of the United States, on June 16, 1858, at what was then the Illinois State Capitol in Springfield, after he had accepted the Illinois Republican Party's nomination as that state's US senator. The nomination of Lincoln was the final item of business at the convention, which then broke for dinner, meeting again at 8 PM. \"The evening session was mainly devoted to speeches\",[1] but the only speaker was Lincoln, whose address closed the convention, save for resolutions of thanks to the city of Springfield and others. His address was immediately published in full by newspapers,[2][3][4] as a pamphlet,[5] and in the published Proceedings of the convention.[6] It was the launching point of his unsuccessful campaign for the Senatorial seat held by Stephen A. Douglas; the campaign would climax with the Lincolnâ€“Douglas debates. When Lincoln collected and published his debates with Douglas as part of his 1860 Presidential campaign, he prefixed them with relevant prior speeches. The \"House Divided\" speech opens the volume.[7]","image":"Abraham_Lincoln_by_Byers%2C_1858_-_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Lincoln's_House_Divided_Speech"}
