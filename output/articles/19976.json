{"title":"Heliosphere","summary":"The heliosphere is the magnetosphere, astrosphere and outermost atmospheric layer of the Sun. It takes the shape of a vast, bubble-like region of space. In plasma physics terms, it is the cavity formed by the Sun in the surrounding interstellar medium. The \"bubble\" of the heliosphere is continuously \"inflated\" by plasma originating from the Sun, known as the solar wind. Outside the heliosphere, this solar plasma gives way to the interstellar plasma permeating the Milky Way. As part of the interplanetary magnetic field, the heliosphere shields the Solar System from a significant amount of cosmic rays, including hazardous ionizing radiation (e.g. gamma rays). Its name was likely coined by Alexander J. Dessler, who is credited with first use of the word in scientific literature in 1967.[1] The scientific study of the heliosphere is heliophysics, which includes space weather and space climate.","image":"PIA22835-VoyagerProgram%26Heliosphere-Chart-20181210.png.webp"}
