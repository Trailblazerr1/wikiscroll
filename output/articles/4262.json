{"title":"Archaeological culture","summary":"An archaeological culture is a recurring assemblage of types of artifacts, buildings and monuments from a specific period and region that may constitute the material culture remains of a particular past human society. The connection between these types is an empirical observation. But their interpretation in terms of ethnic or political groups is based on archaeologists' understanding and interpretation, and is in many cases subject to long unresolved debates. The concept of the archaeological culture is fundamental to culture-historical archaeology.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp"}
