{"title":"International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration","summary":"The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) is a transliteration scheme that allows the lossless romanisation of Indic scripts as employed by Sanskrit and related Indic languages.  It is based on a scheme that emerged during the nineteenth century from suggestions by Charles Trevelyan, William Jones, Monier Monier-Williams and other scholars, and formalised by the Transliteration Committee of the Geneva Oriental Congress, in September 1894.[1]  IAST makes it possible for the reader to read the Indic text unambiguously, exactly as if it were in the original Indic script.  It is this faithfulness to the original scripts that accounts for its continuing popularity amongst scholars.","image":"Gucharmap_screenshot.png.webp"}
