{"title":"Alluvial fan","summary":"An alluvial fan is an accumulation of sediments shaped like a section of a shallow cone,[1] with its apex at a point source of sediments, such as a narrow canyon emerging from an escarpment.[2] They are characteristic of mountainous terrain in arid to semiarid climates,[3][4] but are also found in more humid environments subject to intense rainfall[1] and in areas of modern glaciation.[4] They range in area from less than 1 square kilometre (0.39 sq mi)[4][5] to almost 20,000 square kilometres (7,700 sq mi).[6]","image":"Alluvial_fan_01.JPG.webp"}
