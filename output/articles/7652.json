{"title":"Britney (album)","summary":"Britney is the third studio album by American singer Britney Spears, released on October 31, 2001, through Jive Records. Looking to transition from the teen pop styles of her first and sophomore albums ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000) respectively, Spears began to embrace a significantly more mature sound with Britney. The album music incorporates genres of pop and R&B with influences of electronic dance and occasionally dips into elements of disco, hip hop, rock, and electronica. Its lyrics address the subjects of coming of age, adulthood, control, and sexuality.[1] Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including Max Martin and Rami Yacoub.[2] Spears herself assumed a more prominent role in the album's development, co-writing six of its tracks.","image":"Britney_Spears_-_Britney.png.webp"}
