{"title":"Digital signal","summary":"A digital signal is a signal that represents data as a sequence of discrete values; at any given time it can only take on, at most, one of a finite number of values.[1][2][3] This contrasts with an analog signal, which represents continuous values; at any given time it represents a real number within a continuous range of values.","image":"Original_message.jpg.webp","url":"Digital_signal"}
