{"title":"Origin of replication","summary":"The origin of replication (also called the replication origin) is a particular sequence in a genome at which replication is initiated.[1] Propagation of the genetic material between generations requires timely and accurate duplication of DNA by semiconservative replication prior to cell division to ensure each daughter cell receives the full complement of chromosomes.[2] This can either involve the replication of DNA in living organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes, or that of DNA or RNA in viruses, such as double-stranded RNA viruses.[3] Synthesis of daughter strands starts at discrete sites, termed replication origins, and proceeds in a bidirectional manner until all genomic DNA is replicated. Despite the fundamental nature of these events, organisms have evolved surprisingly divergent strategies that control replication onset.[2] Although the specific replication origin organization structure and recognition varies from species to species, some common characteristics are shared.","image":"Origins_of_DNA_replication_Figure_1.jpg.webp","url":"Origin_of_replication"}
