{"title":"e (mathematical constant)","summary":"The number e, also known as Euler's number, is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828, and can be characterized in many ways. It is the base of the natural logarithm.[1][2] It is the limit of (1 + 1/n)n as n approaches infinity, an expression that arises in the study of compound interest. It can also be calculated as the sum of the infinite series[3][4]","image":"aea781b0039c2aac6011a7e8ad9d19d47bf7d919.svg"}
