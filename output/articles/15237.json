{"title":"Ethnomethodology","summary":"Ethnomethodology is the study of how social order is produced in and through processes of social interaction.[1] It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream sociological approaches.[2] In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.[3] Its early investigations led to the founding of conversation analysis, which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see § Varieties).[4]","image":"Social_Network_Diagram_(segment).svg.png.webp","url":"Ethnomethodology"}
