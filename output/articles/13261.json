{"title":"Docetism","summary":"In the history of Christianity, docetism (from the Koinē Greek: δοκεῖν/δόκησις dokeĩn \"to seem\", dókēsis \"apparition, phantom\"[1][2]) is the heterodox doctrine that the phenomenon of Jesus, his historical and bodily existence, and above all the human form of Jesus, was mere semblance without any true reality.[3][4] Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion.","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp","url":"Docetism"}
