{"title":"Bulimia nervosa","summary":"Bulimia nervosa, also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging; and excessive concern with body shape and weight.[9][2] The aim of this activity is to expel the body of calories eaten from the binging phase of the process.[9] Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time.[2] Purging refers to the attempts to get rid of the food consumed.[2] This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives.[2] Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise.[2][4] Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight.[1] The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles, breakdown of the teeth and effects on metabolic rate and caloric intake which cause thyroid dysfunction.[2][10] Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder[11] and problems with drugs or alcohol.[2] There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.[3] Clinical studies show a relationship between bulimia and vulnerable narcissism as caused by childhood 'parental invalidation' leading to a later need for social validation.[12]","image":"BulemiaEnamalLoss.JPG.webp"}
