{"title":"History of the Jews in Morocco","summary":"Moroccan Jews constitute an ancient community. Before the founding of Israel in 1948, there were about 250,000 to 350,000 Jews[1] in the country, which gave Morocco the largest Jewish community in the Muslim world, but by 2017 only 2,000 or so remain.[2] Jews in Morocco, originally speakers of Berber languages, Judeo-Moroccan Arabic or Judaeo-Spanish, were the first in the country to adopt the French language in the mid-19th century, and unlike the muslim population French remains the main (and, in many cases, the exclusive) language of members of the Jewish community there.[3]","image":"Historical_Jewish_communities_of_Morocco.svg.png.webp"}
