{"title":"Protein primary structure","summary":"Protein primary structure is the linear sequence of amino acids in a peptide or protein.[1] By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino-terminal (N) end to the carboxyl-terminal (C) end. Protein biosynthesis is most commonly performed by ribosomes in cells. Peptides can also be synthesized in the laboratory. Protein primary structures can be directly sequenced, or inferred from DNA sequences.","image":"Protein_structure_(1).png.webp","url":"Protein_primary_structure"}
