{"title":"Guqin","summary":"The guqin ([kùtɕʰǐn] (listen); Chinese: 古琴) is a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument. It has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favoured by scholars and literati as an instrument of great subtlety and refinement, as highlighted by the quote \"a gentleman does not part with his qin or se without good reason,\"[1] as well as being associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius. It is sometimes referred to by the Chinese as \"the father of Chinese music\" or \"the instrument of the sages\". The guqin is not to be confused with the guzheng, another Chinese long stringed instrument also without frets, but with moveable bridges under each string.","image":"ZhongNiShi.jpg.webp","url":"Guqin"}
