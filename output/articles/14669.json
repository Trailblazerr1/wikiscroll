{"title":"Emigration","summary":"Emigration is the act of leaving a resident country or place of residence[1] with the intent to settle elsewhere (to permanently leave a country).[2] Conversely, immigration describes the movement of people into one country from another (to permanently move to a country).[3] Hence one might emigrate from one's native country to immigrate to another country. Both are acts of migration across national or other geographical boundaries.","image":"Affiche_émigration_JP_au_BR-déb._XXe_s..jpg.webp"}
