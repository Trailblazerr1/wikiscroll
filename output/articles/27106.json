{"title":"Little egret","summary":"The little egret (Egretta garzetta) is a species of small heron in the family Ardeidae. It is a white bird with a slender black beak, long black legs and, in the western race, yellow feet. As an aquatic bird, it feeds in shallow water and on land, consuming a variety of small creatures. It breeds colonially, often with other species of water birds, making a platform nest of sticks in a tree, bush or reed bed. A clutch of three to  five bluish-green eggs is laid and incubated by both parents for about three weeks. The young fledge at about six weeks of age.","image":"Little_egret_(Egretta_garzetta)_Photograph_by_Shantanu_Kuveskar.jpg.webp"}
