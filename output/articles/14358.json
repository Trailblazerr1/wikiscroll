{"title":"Eisenhower dollar","summary":"The Eisenhower dollar was a one-dollar coin issued by the United States Mint from 1971 to 1978; it was the first coin of that denomination issued by the Mint since the Peace dollar series ended in 1935. The coin depicts President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the obverse, and a stylized image honoring the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon mission on the reverse, with both sides designed by Frank Gasparro (the reverse is based on the Apollo 11 mission patch designed by astronaut Michael Collins). It is the only large-size U.S. dollar coin whose circulation strikes contained no silver.","image":"1974S_Eisenhower_Obverse.jpg.webp"}
