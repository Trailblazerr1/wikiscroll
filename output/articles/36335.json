{"title":"Protofeminism","summary":"Protofeminism is a concept that anticipates modern feminism in eras when the feminist concept as such was still unknown.[1] This refers particularly to times before the 20th century,[2][3] although the precise usage is disputed, as 18th-century feminism and 19th-century feminism are often subsumed into \"feminism\". The usefulness of the term protofeminist has been questioned by some modern scholars,[4] as has the term postfeminist.","image":"Symbol_venus.svg.png.webp"}
