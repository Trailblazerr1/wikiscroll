{"title":"Amantadine","summary":"Amantadine, sold under the brand name Gocovri among others, is a medication used to treat dyskinesia associated with parkinsonism and influenza caused by type A influenzavirus, though its use for the latter is no longer recommended due to widespread drug resistance.[3][4] It acts as a nicotinic antagonist, dopamine agonist, and noncompetitive NMDA antagonist.[5][6] The antiviral mechanism of action is antagonism of the influenzavirus A M2 proton channel, which prevents endosomal escape (i.e. the release of viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm).[7][8]","image":"Amantadine.svg.png.webp","url":"Amantadine"}
