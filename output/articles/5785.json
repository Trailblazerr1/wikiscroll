{"title":"Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)","summary":"The Battle of Aleppo (Arabic: مَعْرَكَةُ حَلَبَ‎, romanized: Maʿrakat Ḥalab) was a major military confrontation in Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, between the Syrian opposition (including the Free Syrian Army (FSA) and other largely-Sunni groups, such as the Levant Front and the al-Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusra Front)[85] against the Syrian government, supported by Hezbollah, Shia militias and Russia,[61][86] and against the Kurdish-majority People's Protection Units (YPG). The battle began on 19 July 2012 and was part of the ongoing Syrian Civil War.[87] A stalemate that had been in place for four years finally ended in July 2016, when Syrian government troops closed the rebels' last supply line into Aleppo with the support of Russian airstrikes. In response, rebel forces launched unsuccessful counteroffensives in September and October that failed to break the siege; in November, government forces embarked on a decisive campaign that resulted in the recapture of all of Aleppo by December 2016.[88] The Syrian government victory was widely seen as a turning point in Syria's civil war.[89][90]","image":"Battle_of_Aleppo.jpg.webp"}
