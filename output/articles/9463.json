{"title":"Chemical bond","summary":"A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds. The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds. The strength of chemical bonds varies considerably; there are \"strong bonds\" or \"primary bonds\" such as covalent, ionic and metallic bonds, and \"weak bonds\" or \"secondary bonds\" such as dipoleâ€“dipole interactions, the London dispersion force and hydrogen bonding.","image":"Photo_of_carbon_with_4_valence_electrons.png.webp","url":"Chemical_bond"}
