{"title":"Abitur","summary":"Abitur (German: [abiˈtuːɐ̯]), often shortened colloquially to Abi, is a qualification granted at the end of secondary education in Germany.  It is conferred on students who pass their final exams at the end of ISCED 3, usually after twelve or thirteen years of schooling (see also, for Germany, Abitur after twelve years).  In German, the term Abitur has roots in the archaic word Abiturium, which in turn was derived from the Latin abiturus (future active participle of abire, thus \"someone who is going to leave\").","image":"Abipedia.jpg.webp"}
