{"title":"Three-fifths Compromise","summary":"The Three-fifths Compromise was an agreement reached during the 1787 United States Constitutional Convention over the counting of slaves in determining a state's total population.  This count would determine the number of seats in the House of Representatives and how much each state would pay in taxes. The compromise counted three-fifths of each state's slave population toward that state's total population for the purpose of apportioning the House of Representatives. Even though slaves were denied voting rights, this gave Southern states a third more Representatives and a third more presidential electoral votes than if slaves had not been counted. Free Blacks were not subject to the compromise and each was counted as one full person for representation.[1]","image":"IJzeren_voetring_voor_gevangenen_transparent_background.png.webp","url":"Three-fifths_Compromise"}
