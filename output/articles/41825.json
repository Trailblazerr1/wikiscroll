{"title":"Spring (hydrology)","summary":"A spring is a point at which water flows from an aquifer to the Earth's surface. It is a component of the hydrosphere. Springs have long been important for humans as a source of water, especially in arid regions which have relatively little annual rainfall. They range in flow rate from nearly zero to more than 450 cubic feet per second, for the biggest springs. Springs are fed by groundwater, which is forced to the surface by various natural forces such as gravity and water pressure.","image":"Big_Spring_Missouri_1-02Aug08.jpg.webp"}
