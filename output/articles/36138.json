{"title":"Private property","summary":"Private property is a legal designation for the ownership of property by non-governmental legal entities.[1] Private property is distinguishable from public property, which is owned by a state entity, and from collective or cooperative property, which is owned by a group of non-governmental entities.[2] The distinction between private and personal property varies depending on political philosophy, with socialist perspectives making a hard distinction between the two,[3] while others blend the two together.[4] As a legal concept, private property is defined and enforced by a country's political system.[5]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp"}
