{"title":"Train","summary":"In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight. The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning \"to pull, to draw\".[1] Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as \"engines\"), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units. Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons. Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, which allows low friction and makes them more efficient than other forms of transport.","image":"Поезд_на_фоне_горы_Шатрище._Воронежская_область.jpg.webp","url":"Train"}
