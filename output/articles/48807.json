{"title":"Wolfe Tone","summary":"Theobald Wolfe Tone, posthumously known as Wolfe Tone (Irish: Bhulbh Teón;[1] 20 June 1763 – 19 November 1798), was a leading Irish revolutionary figure and one of the founding members in Belfast and Dublin of the United Irishmen, a republican society determined to end British rule in Ireland. He was active in drawing Irish Catholics and Presbyterians together in the United cause, and in soliciting French assistance for a general insurrection. In November 1798, on his second attempt to land in Ireland with French troops and supplies, he was captured by British naval forces. The United Irish risings of the summer had already been crushed. Tone died in advance of his scheduled execution, today, it is generally believed, by his own hand.","image":"Portrait_of_Theobald_Wolfe_Tone.PNG.webp"}
