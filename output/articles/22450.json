{"title":"Iron(II) oxide","summary":"Iron(II) oxide or ferrous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula FeO.  Its mineral form is known as w√ºstite.[3][4] One of several iron oxides, it is a black-colored powder that is sometimes confused with rust, the latter of which consists of hydrated iron(III) oxide (ferric oxide). Iron(II) oxide also refers to a family of related non-stoichiometric compounds, which are typically iron deficient with compositions ranging from Fe0.84O to Fe0.95O.[5]","image":"Iron(II)_oxide.jpg.webp","url":"Iron(II)_oxide"}
