{"title":"Battle of Plassey","summary":"The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company over the Nawab of Bengal and his French[1] allies on 23 June 1757, under the leadership of Robert Clive, which was possible due to the defection of Mir Jafar, who was Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah's commander in chief. The battle helped the Company seize control of Bengal. Over the next hundred years, they seized control of most of the Indian subcontinent, Myanmar, and Afghanistan.","image":"Clive.jpg.webp"}
