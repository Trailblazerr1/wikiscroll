{"title":"Fenway Park","summary":"Fenway Park is a baseball park located in Boston, Massachusetts, near Kenmore Square. Since 1912, it has been the home for the Boston Red Sox, the city's American League baseball team, and since 1953, its only Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise. While the stadium was built in 1912, it was substantially rebuilt in 1934,[9] and underwent major renovations and modifications in the 21st century. It is the oldest active ballpark in MLB.[10] Because of its age and constrained location in Boston's dense Fenwayâ€“Kenmore neighborhood, the park has many quirky features, including \"The Triangle\", Pesky's Pole, and the Green Monster in left field. It is the fifth-smallest among MLB ballparks by seating capacity, second-smallest by total capacity, and one of eight that cannot accommodate at least 40,000 spectators.","image":"Fenway_Park_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Fenway_Park"}
