{"title":"Bamum script","summary":"The Bamum scripts are an evolutionary series of six scripts created for the Bamum language by King Njoya of Cameroon at the turn of the 19th century. They are notable for evolving from a pictographic system to a partially alphabetic syllabic script in the space of 14 years, from 1896 to 1910. Bamum type was cast in 1918, but the script fell into disuse around 1931.  A project began around 2007 to revive the Bamum script.","image":"Shumom-text.jpg.webp"}
