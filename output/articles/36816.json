{"title":"Quorum sensing","summary":"In biology, quorum sensing or quorum signalling (QS)[1] is the ability to detect and respond to cell population density by gene regulation. As one example, QS enables bacteria to restrict the expression of specific genes to the high cell densities at which the resulting phenotypes will be most beneficial. Many species of bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression according to the density of their local population. In a similar fashion, some social insects use quorum sensing to determine where to nest. Quorum sensing may also be useful for cancer cell communications.[2]","image":"Flagellum_from_a_gram-negative_bacterium_(unlabelled).png.webp","url":"Quorum_sensing"}
