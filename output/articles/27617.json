{"title":"Luminiferous aether","summary":"Luminiferous aether or ether[1] (\"luminiferous\", meaning \"light-bearing\") was the postulated medium for the propagation of light.[2] It was invoked to explain the ability of the apparently wave-based light to propagate through empty space (a vacuum), something that waves should not be able to do. The assumption of a spatial plenum of luminiferous aether, rather than a spatial vacuum, provided the theoretical medium that was required by wave theories of light.","image":"AetherWind.svg.png.webp","url":"Luminiferous_aether"}
