{"title":"Power-up","summary":"In video games, a power-up is an object that adds temporary benefits or extra abilities to the player character as a game mechanic.[1] This is in contrast to an item, which may or may not have a permanent benefit that can be used at any time chosen by the player. Although often collected directly through touch, power-ups can sometimes only be gained by collecting several related items, such as the floating letters of the word 'EXTEND' in Bubble Bobble. Well known examples of power-ups that have entered popular culture include the power pellets from Pac-Man[2] (regarded as the first power-up)[3] and the Super Mushroom from Super Mario Bros., which ranked first in UGO Networks' Top 11 Video Game Powerups.[4]","image":"Supermushroom.png.webp"}
