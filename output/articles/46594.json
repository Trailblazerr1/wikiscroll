{"title":"Unified Extensible Firmware Interface","summary":"The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)[1] is a publicly available specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. UEFI replaces the legacy Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers,[2][3] with most UEFI firmware implementations providing support for legacy BIOS services. UEFI can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed.[4]","image":"Efi-simple.svg.png.webp"}
