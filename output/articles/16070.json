{"title":"Fiber-optic communication","summary":"Fiber-optic communication is a method of transmitting information from one place to another by sending pulses of infrared light[1] through an optical fiber. The light is a form of carrier wave that is modulated to carry information.[2] Fiber is preferred over electrical cabling when high bandwidth, long distance, or immunity to electromagnetic interference is required.[3] This type of communication can transmit voice, video, and telemetry through local area networks or across long distances.[4]","image":"Optical-fibre-junction-box.jpg.webp"}
