{"title":"Frances Oldham Kelsey","summary":"Frances Kathleen Oldham Kelsey, CM (July 24, 1914 â€“ August 7, 2015) was a Canadian-American[1] pharmacologist and physician. As a reviewer for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), she refused to authorize thalidomide for market because she had concerns about the lack of evidence regarding the drug's safety.[2] Her concerns proved to be justified when it was shown that thalidomide caused serious birth defects. Kelsey's career intersected with the passage of laws strengthening FDA oversight of pharmaceuticals. Kelsey was the second woman to receive the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service, awarded to her by John F. Kennedy in 1962.","image":"Frances_Oldham_Kelsey.png.webp","url":"Frances_Oldham_Kelsey"}
