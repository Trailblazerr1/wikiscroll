{"title":"Johnny Cash","summary":"John R. Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career.[4][5] He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice,[lower-alpha 1][6] the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness[7][8] coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor,[4] free prison concerts,[9] and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe which earned him the nickname \"The Man in Black\".[lower-alpha 2]","image":"Johnny_Cash_1977.jpg.webp","url":"Johnny_Cash"}
