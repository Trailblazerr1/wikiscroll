{"title":"History of the Jews in Ireland","summary":"The history of the Jews in Ireland extends back nearly a thousand years. Although the Jewish community in Ireland has always been small in numbers (not exceeding 5,500 since at least 1891), it is well established and has generally been well-accepted into Irish life. Jews in Ireland have historically enjoyed a relative tolerance that was largely absent elsewhere in Europe.","image":"Map_of_Ireland_in_Europe.svg.png.webp","url":"History_of_the_Jews_in_Ireland"}
