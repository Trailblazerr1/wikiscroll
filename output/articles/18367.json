{"title":"Gold standard","summary":"A gold standard is a monetary system in which the standard economic unit of account is based on a fixed quantity of gold. The gold standard was the basis for the international monetary system from the 1870s to the early 1920s, and from the late 1920s to 1932[1][2] as well as from 1944 until 1971 when the United States unilaterally terminated convertibility of the US dollar to gold foreign central banks, effectively ending the Bretton Woods system.[3] Many states still hold substantial gold reserves.[4][5]","image":"Two_20kr_gold_coins.png.webp"}
