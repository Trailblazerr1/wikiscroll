{"title":"List of Green Bay Packers head coaches","summary":"There have been 15 head coaches for the Green Bay Packers, a professional American football team of the National Football League (NFL). The franchise was founded in 1919 by Curly Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun and competed for two years against teams around Wisconsin and Michigan before entering into the American Professional Football Association, which is now known as the NFL. During this time, Lambeau served as team captain, a position that more closely matched the modern head coach position. Willard Ryan and Joseph Merrill Hoeffel both served as the official head coach in the early 1920s, however based on the roles of head coach and team captain, the Packers recognize Lambeau as the first coach.[2]","image":"Mike_McCarthy_(TJG).JPG.webp"}
