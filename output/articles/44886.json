{"title":"Thescelosaurus","summary":"Thescelosaurus (/ˌθɛsɪləˈsɔːrəs/ THESS-il-ə-SOR-əs; ancient Greek θέσκελος- (theskelos-) meaning \"godlike\", \"marvellous\", or \"wondrous\" and σαυρος (sauros) \"lizard\")[2] was a genus of small neornithischian dinosaur that appeared at the very end of the Late Cretaceous period in North America. It was a member of the last dinosaurian fauna before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago. The preservation and completeness of many of its specimens indicate that it may have preferred to live near streams.","image":"Burpee_-_Thescelosaurus.JPG.webp"}
