{"title":"Ellipse","summary":"In mathematics, an ellipse is a plane curve surrounding two focal points, such that for all points on the curve, the sum of the two distances to the focal points is a constant. As such, it generalizes a circle, which is the special type of ellipse in which the two focal points are the same. The elongation of an ellipse is measured by its eccentricity \n  \n    \n      \n        e\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e}\n  \n, a number ranging from \n  \n    \n      \n        e\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e=0}\n  \n (the limiting case of a circle) to \n  \n    \n      \n        e\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle e=1}\n  \n (the limiting case of infinite elongation, no longer an ellipse but a parabola).","image":"cd253103f0876afc68ebead27a5aa9867d927467.svg"}
