{"title":"Loggia","summary":"A loggia (/ˈloʊdʒ(i)ə/ LOH-j(ee-)ə, usually UK: /ˈlɒdʒ(i)ə/ LOJ-(ee-)ə, Italian: [ˈlɔddʒa]) is an architectural feature which is a covered exterior gallery or corridor usually on an upper level, or sometimes ground level.  The outer wall is open to the elements, usually supported by a series of columns or arches.  They can be on principal fronts and/or sides of a building and are not meant for entrance but as an outdoor sitting room.[1][2][3] An overhanging loggia may be supported by a baldresca.[4]","image":"Ratusz2007.jpg.webp"}
