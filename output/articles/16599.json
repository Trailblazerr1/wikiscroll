{"title":"Food energy","summary":"Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food and molecular oxygen[1] through the process of cellular respiration. Cellular respiration involves either the process of joining oxygen from air with the molecules of food (aerobic respiration) or the process of reorganizing the atoms within the molecules (anaerobic respiration).","image":"823853399619bf2a9380481e7694c460d45c46c6.svg"}
