{"title":"Toxic (song)","summary":"\"Toxic\" is a song by American singer Britney Spears for her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was written and produced by Bloodshy & Avant, with additional writing from Cathy Dennis and Henrik Jonback. Released as the second single from In the Zone, the song was initially offered to Kylie Minogue for her album Body Language, but she turned it down. After trying to choose between \"(I Got That) Boom Boom\" and \"Outrageous\" to be the second single, Spears selected \"Toxic\" instead. A dance-pop and techno-pop song with elements of bhangra music, \"Toxic\" features varied instrumentation, such as drums, synthesizers and surf guitar. It is accompanied by high-pitched Bollywood strings, sampled from Lata Mangeshkar and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam's \"Tere Mere Beech Mein\" (1981), and breathy vocals. Its lyrics draw an extended metaphor of a lover as a dangerous yet addictive drug.","image":"Britney_Spears_Toxic.png.webp"}
