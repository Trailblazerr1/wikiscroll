{"title":"Shoaling and schooling","summary":"In biology, any group of fish that stay together for social reasons are shoaling, and if the group is swimming in the same direction in a coordinated manner, they are schooling.[1] In common usage, the terms are sometimes used rather loosely.[1] About one quarter of fish species shoal all their lives, and about one half shoal for part of their lives.[2]","image":"Maldives_Surgeonfish%2C_Acanthurus_leucosternon.jpg.webp"}
