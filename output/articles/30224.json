{"title":"Modern Vampires of the City","summary":"Modern Vampires of the City is the third studio album by American indie rock band Vampire Weekend. It was released on May 14, 2013, by XL Recordings. The group began to write songs for the album during soundchecks on the supporting concert tour for their 2010 album Contra. After a period in which each member explored individual musical projects, they regrouped and continued working on Modern Vampires of the City in 2011. With no deadline in mind, the band brought in an outside record producer for the first time, Ariel Rechtshaid, to record the album.","image":"Vampire_Weekend_-_Modern_Vampires_of_the_City.png.webp","url":"Modern_Vampires_of_the_City"}
