{"title":"CIE 1931 color space","summary":"The CIE 1931 color spaces are the first defined quantitative links between distributions of wavelengths in the electromagnetic visible spectrum, and physiologically perceived colors in human color vision. The mathematical relationships that define these color spaces are essential tools for color management, important when dealing with color inks, illuminated displays, and recording devices such as digital cameras. The system was designed in 1931 by the \"Commission Internationale de l'Ã©clairage\", known in English as the International Commission on Illumination.","image":"Cones_SMJ2_E.svg.png.webp"}
