{"title":"\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)","summary":"\"Heroes\" is the 12th studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 14 October 1977 by RCA Records. After releasing Low earlier that year, Bowie toured as the keyboardist of his friend and singer Iggy Pop. At the conclusion of the tour, they recorded Pop's second solo album Lust for Life at Hansa Tonstudio in West Berlin before Bowie regrouped there with collaborator Brian Eno and producer Tony Visconti to record \"Heroes\". It was the second instalment of his Berlin Trilogy, following Low and preceding Lodger (1979). Of the three albums, it was the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. Much of the same personnel from Low returned for the sessions, augmented by King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.","image":"David_Bowie_-_Heroes.png.webp"}
