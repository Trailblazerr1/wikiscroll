{"title":"Wyatt Earp","summary":"Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp (March 19, 1848 â€“ January 13, 1929) was a gambler and Old West lawman in the American West, including Dodge City, Deadwood, and Tombstone. He took part in the famous gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which lawmen killed three outlaw Cochise County Cowboys. He is often erroneously regarded as the central figure in the shootout, although his brother Virgil was the Tombstone City and Deputy U.S. Marshal that day, and had far more experience in combat as a sheriff, constable, marshal, and soldier.[2]","image":"Wyatt_Earp_portrait.png.webp","url":"Wyatt_Earp"}
