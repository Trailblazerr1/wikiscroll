{"title":"YouTube Creator Awards","summary":"YouTube Creator Awards, commonly known as YouTube Play Buttons or YouTube Plaques, are a series of awards from YouTube that aim to recognize its most popular channels. They are based on a channel's subscriber count but are offered at the sole discretion of YouTube. Each channel is reviewed before an award is issued, to ensure that the channel follows the YouTube community guidelines.[1] YouTube reserves the right to refuse to hand out a Creator Award, which it has done for channels featuring horror or extremist political content.[2][3]","image":"Satish_kushwaha.jpg.webp","url":"YouTube_Creator_Awards"}
