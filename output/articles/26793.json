{"title":"List of counties in Florida","summary":"There are 67 counties in the U.S. state of Florida. It became a territory of the U.S. in 1821 with two counties complementing the provincial divisions retained as a Spanish territory: Escambia to the west and St. Johns to the east, divided by the Suwannee River. All of the other counties were apportioned from these two original counties. Florida became the 27th U.S. state in 1845, and its last county was created in 1925 with the formation of Gilchrist County from a segment of Alachua County.[1] Florida's counties are subdivisions of the state government. In 1968, counties gained the power to develop their own charters.[2] All but two of Florida's county seats are incorporated municipalities: the exceptions are Crawfordville, county seat of rural Wakulla County,[3] and East Naples, located outside Naples city limits in Collier County.","image":"Florida_counties.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_counties_in_Florida"}
