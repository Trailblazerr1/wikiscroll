{"title":"Rate of return","summary":"In finance, return is a profit on an investment.[1] It comprises any change in value of the investment, and/or cash flows (or securities, or other investments) which the investor receives from that investment, such as interest payments, coupons, cash dividends, stock dividends or the payoff from a derivative or structured product. It may be measured either in absolute terms (e.g., dollars) or as a percentage of the amount invested. The latter is also called the holding period return.","image":"4b0bfb3769bf24d80e15374dc37b0441e2616e33.svg"}
