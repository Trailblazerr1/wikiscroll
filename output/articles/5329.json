{"title":"Bad Romance","summary":"\"Bad Romance\" is a song and lead single by American singer Lady Gaga from her third EP, The Fame Monster (2009). It was written and produced by Nadir \"RedOne\" Khayat and Lady Gaga. Lyrically, \"Bad Romance\" explores Gaga's attraction to individuals with whom romance never works, her preference for lonely relationships and the paranoia she experienced while on tour. Following an illegal demo leak, Gaga showcased the final product at Alexander McQueen's show at the Paris Fashion Week in October 2009, followed by the release of the single's cover art. Musically, \"Bad Romance\" features a spoken bridge, a full-throated chorus and sung lyrics about being in love with one's best friend. The song, which is imbued with elements of German-esque house and techno, as well as music from the 1980s and 1990s, was touted by Gaga as an experimental pop record. During the bridge Gaga sings a part of the chorus (\"I want your love and I want your revenge\") in French.","image":"Lady_Gaga_-_Bad_Romance.png.webp"}
