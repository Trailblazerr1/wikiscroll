{"title":"Origins of the American Civil War","summary":"Historians who debate the origins of the American Civil War focus on the reasons that seven Southern states (followed by four other states after the onset of the war) declared their secession from the United States (the Union) and united to form the Confederate States (simply known as the \"Confederacy\"), and the reasons that the North refused to let them go. Proponents of the pseudo-historical Lost Cause ideology have denied that slavery was the principal cause of the secession. While historians in the 21st century agree on the centrality of the conflict over slavery—it was not just \"a cause\" of the war but \"the cause\"[1]—they disagree sharply on the aspects of this conflict (ideological, economic, political, or social) that were most important.[2]","image":"Bombardment_of_Fort_Sumter.jpg.webp","url":"Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War"}
