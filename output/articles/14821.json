{"title":"Energy density","summary":"In physics, energy density is the amount of energy stored in a given system or region of space per unit volume. It may also be used for energy per unit mass, though a more accurate term for this is specific energy (or gravimetric energy density).","image":"8ab8a4cc9a2a5f1d6d9c8a823f6bf045bda99f76.svg","url":"Energy_density"}
