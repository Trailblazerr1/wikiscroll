{"title":"Protozoa","summary":"Protozoa (singular protozoon or protozoan, plural protozoa or protozoans) is an informal term for a group of single-celled eukaryotes, either free-living or parasitic, that feed on organic matter such as other microorganisms or organic tissues and debris.[1][2] Historically, protozoans were regarded as \"one-celled animals\", because they often possess animal-like behaviours, such as motility and predation, and lack a cell wall, as found in plants and many algae.[3][4]","image":"Protozoa_collage_2.jpg.webp"}
