{"title":"Caspase","summary":"Caspases (cysteine-aspartic proteases, cysteine aspartases or cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases) are a family of protease enzymes playing essential roles in programmed cell death. They are named caspases due to their specific cysteine protease activity â€“ a cysteine in its active site nucleophilically attacks and cleaves a target protein only after an aspartic acid residue. As of 2009, there are 12 confirmed caspases in humans[note 1] and 10 in mice, carrying out a variety of cellular functions.","image":"Caspase_1.png.webp"}
