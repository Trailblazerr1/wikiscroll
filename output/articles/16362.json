{"title":"Flag of Brazil","summary":"The flag of Brazil (Portuguese: Bandeira do Brasil), is a blue disc depicting a starry sky (which includes the Southern Cross) spanned by a curved band inscribed with the national motto \"Ordem e Progresso\" (\"Order and Progress\"), within a yellow rhombus, on a green field. Brazil officially adopted this design for its national flag on November 19, 1889 — four days after the Proclamation of the Republic, to replace the flag of the Empire of Brazil. The concept was the work of Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, with the collaboration of Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis and Décio Villares.","image":"Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Brazil"}
