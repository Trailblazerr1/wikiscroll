{"title":"Sample-return mission","summary":"A sample-return mission is a spacecraft mission to collect and return samples from an extraterrestrial location to Earth for analysis. Sample-return missions may bring back merely atoms and molecules or a deposit of complex compounds such as loose material and rocks. These samples may be obtained in a number of ways, such as soil and rock excavation or a collector array used for capturing particles of solar wind or cometary debris.","image":"Apollo_15_Genesis_Rock.jpg.webp","url":"Sample-return_mission"}
