{"title":"Linux kernel","summary":"The Linux kernel is a free and open-source,[10][11] monolithic, modular,[12] multitasking, Unix-like operating system kernel.[13] It was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds[14] for his i386-based PC, and it was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU operating system,[15] which was created as a free replacement for UNIX.[16] Since then, it has spawned a large number of operating system distributions, commonly also called Linux.","image":"Tux.svg.png.webp"}
