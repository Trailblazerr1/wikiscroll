{"title":"Stokes' theorem","summary":"Stokes' theorem,[1] also known as Kelvinâ€“Stokes theorem[2][3] after Lord Kelvin and George Stokes, the fundamental theorem for curls or simply the curl theorem,[4] is a theorem in vector calculus on \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{3}}\n  \n. Given a vector field, the theorem relates the integral of the curl of the vector field over some surface, to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary of the surface. The classical Stokes' theorem can be stated in one sentence: The line integral of a vector field over a loop is equal to the flux of its curl through the enclosed surface.","image":"f936ddf584f8f3dd2a0ed08917001b7a404c10b5.svg"}
