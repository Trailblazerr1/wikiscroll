{"title":"Mary Celeste","summary":"Mary Celeste (/səˈlɛst/; often erroneously referred to as Marie Celeste[1]) was an American merchant brigantine discovered adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean off the Azores Islands on December 4, 1872. The Canadian brigantine Dei Gratia found her in a dishevelled but seaworthy condition under partial sail and with her lifeboat missing. The last entry in her log was dated ten days earlier. She had left New York City for Genoa on November 7 and was still amply provisioned when found. Her cargo of denatured alcohol was intact, and the captain's and crew's personal belongings were undisturbed. None of those who had been on board were ever seen or heard from again.","image":"Mary_Celeste_as_Amazon_in_1861_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Mary_Celeste"}
