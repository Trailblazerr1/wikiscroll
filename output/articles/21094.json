{"title":"Hungarian Revolution of 1956","summary":"The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (also the Hungarian Uprising, 23 October – 10 November 1956; Hungarian: 1956-os forradalom), was a countrywide revolution against the Stalinist government of the Hungarian People's Republic (1949–1989) and the Hungarian domestic policies imposed by the USSR. Initially anarchic, the Hungarian Uprising was the first major nationalist challenge to Soviet Union's control of Hungary since the Red Army ended the Nazi occupation of Hungary at the end of the Second World War in Europe, in May 1945.[nb 2]","image":"Hole_in_flag_-_Budapest_1956.jpg.webp"}
