{"title":"Budgerigar","summary":"The budgerigar (/ˈbʌdʒərɪˌɡɑːr/ buhj-uh-ree-gah;[3] Melopsittacus undulatus), also known as the common parakeet or shell parakeet, is a small, long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie (/ˈbʌdʒi/ buhj-ee),[3][4] or in American English, the parakeet. Budgies are the only species in the genus Melopsittacus. Naturally, the species is green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings.[5] Budgies are bred in captivity with colouring of blues, whites, yellows, greys, and even with small crests.[5][6] Juveniles and chicks are monomorphic, while adults are told apart by their cere colouring, and their behaviour.","image":"Budgerigar-male-strzelecki-qld.jpg.webp"}
