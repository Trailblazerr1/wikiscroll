{"title":"Myco-heterotrophy","summary":"Myco-heterotrophy (from Greek μύκης mykes, \"fungus\", ἕτερος heteros, \"another\", \"different\" and τροφή trophe, \"nutrition\") is a symbiotic relationship between certain kinds of plants and fungi, in which the plant gets all or part of its food from parasitism upon fungi rather than from photosynthesis. A myco-heterotroph is the parasitic plant partner in this relationship. Myco-heterotrophy is considered a kind of cheating relationship and myco-heterotrophs are sometimes informally referred to as \"mycorrhizal cheaters\". This relationship is sometimes referred to as mycotrophy, though this term is also used for plants that engage in mutualistic mycorrhizal relationships.","image":"Pink_indian_pipes.jpg.webp"}
