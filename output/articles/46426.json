{"title":"USS Indiana (BB-1)","summary":"USS Indiana (BB-1) was the lead ship of her class and the first battleship in the United States Navy comparable to foreign battleships of the time.[5] Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship also pioneered the use of an intermediate battery. She was designed for coastal defense[6] and as a result, her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.","image":"USS_Indiana_LOC_npcc_32733.jpg.webp","url":"USS_Indiana_(BB-1)"}
