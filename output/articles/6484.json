{"title":"Big Five personality traits","summary":"The Big Five personality traits is a suggested taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits,[1] developed from the 1980s onwards in psychological trait theory. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, it reveals semantic associations: some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \"always prepared\" rather than \"messy\". These associations suggest five broad dimensions used in common language to describe the human personality, temperament and psyche.[2][3]","image":"Wiki-grafik_peats-de_big_five_ENG.png.webp"}
