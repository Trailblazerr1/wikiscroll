{"title":"Star system","summary":"A star system or stellar system is a small number of stars that orbit each other,[1] bound by gravitational attraction. A large group of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a star cluster or galaxy, although, broadly speaking, they are also star systems. Star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems, which include planets and similar bodies (such as comets).","image":"Algol_triple_star_system_imaged_with_the_CHARA_interferometer.jpg.webp","url":"Star_system"}
