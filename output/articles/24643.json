{"title":"Ketosis","summary":"Ketosis is a metabolic state characterized by elevated levels of ketone bodies in the blood or urine.[1] Physiologic ketosis is a normal response to low glucose availability, such as low-carbohydrate diets or fasting, that provides an additional energy source for the brain in the form of ketones. In physiologic ketosis, ketones in the blood are elevated above baseline levels, but the body's acidâ€“base homeostasis is maintained. This contrasts with ketoacidosis, an uncontrolled production of ketones that occurs in pathologic states and causes a metabolic acidosis, which is a medical emergency. Ketoacidosis is most commonly the result of complete insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes or late-stage type 2 diabetes. Ketone levels can be measured in blood, urine or breath and are generally between 0.5 and 3.0 millimolar (mM) in physiologic ketosis, while ketoacidosis may cause blood concentrations greater than 10 mM.[2]","image":"Ketone_bodies.png.webp"}
