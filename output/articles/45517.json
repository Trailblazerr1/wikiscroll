{"title":"Top Gear (2002 TV series)","summary":"Top Gear is a British motoring magazine and factual television programme, designed as a relaunched version of the original 1977 show of the same name by Jeremy Clarkson and Andy Wilman for the BBC, and premiered on 20 October 2002. The programme focuses on the examination and reviewing of motor vehicles, primarily cars, though this was expanded upon after the broadcast of its earlier series to incorporate films featuring motoring-based challenges, special races, timed laps of notable cars, and celebrity timed laps on a course specially-designed for the relaunched programme. The programme drew acclaim for its visual and presentation style since its launch, which focused on being entertaining to viewers, as well as criticism over the controversial nature of its content.[2][3][4] The programme was aired on BBC Two until it was moved to BBC One for its twenty-ninth series in 2020.","image":"TopGearLogo.svg.png.webp","url":"Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)"}
