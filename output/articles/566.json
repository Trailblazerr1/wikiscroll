{"title":"2013 German federal election","summary":"Federal elections were held on 22 September to elect the members of the 18th Bundestag of Germany.[1] At stake were all 598 seats to the Bundestag, plus 33 overhang seats determined thereafter. The Christian Democratic Union of Germany/Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CDU/CSU) of incumbent chancellor Angela Merkel won their best result since 1990 with nearly 42% of the vote and nearly 50% of the seats, just five short for an overall majority. The Free Democratic Party (FDP) failed to meet the 5% vote electoral threshold in what was their worst showing ever in a federal election, denying them seats in the Bundestag for the first time in their history.","image":"Flag_of_Germany.svg.png.webp","url":"2013_German_federal_election"}
