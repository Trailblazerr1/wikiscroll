{"title":"σ-algebra","summary":"In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, a σ-algebra (also σ-field) on a set X is a collection Σ {\\displaystyle \\Sigma } of subsets of X satisfying the following conditions : (1) it includes X itself, (2) it is closed under complement, (3) it is closed under countable unions, and (4) it is closed under countable intersections. Note that (1) and (2) implies that it includes the empty subset.","image":"9e1f558f53cda207614abdf90162266c70bc5c1e.svg","url":"Σ-algebra"}
