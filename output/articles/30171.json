{"title":"Mixed-sex education","summary":"Mixed-sex education, also known as mixed-gender education, co-education, or coeducation (abbreviated to co-ed or coed), is a system of education where males and females are educated together. Whereas single-sex education was more common up to the 19th century, mixed-sex education has since become standard in many cultures, particularly in Western countries. Single-sex education, however, remains prevalent in many Muslim countries. The relative merits of both systems have been the subject of debate.","image":"Co-Education%2C_by_Charles_Allan_Winter%2C_c._1915%2C_oil_on_canvas_-_Cape_Ann_Museum_-_Gloucester%2C_MA_-_DSC01341.jpg.webp","url":"Mixed-sex_education"}
