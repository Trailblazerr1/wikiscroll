{"title":"Chrysippus","summary":"Chrysippus of Soli (/kraɪˈsɪpəs, krɪ-/;[3] Greek: Χρύσιππος ὁ Σολεύς, Chrysippos ho Soleus; c. 279 – c. 206 BC[4]) was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was a native of Soli, Cilicia, but moved to Athens as a young man, where he became a pupil of Cleanthes in the Stoic school. When Cleanthes died, around 230 BC, Chrysippus became the third head of the school. A prolific writer, Chrysippus expanded the fundamental doctrines of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the school, which earned him the title of Second Founder of Stoicism.[5]","image":"Chrysippos_BM_1846.jpg.webp","url":"Chrysippus"}
