{"title":"Theodoric the Great","summary":"Theodoric (or Theoderic) the Great (454 – 30 August 526), also called Theodoric the Amal (Latin: Flāvius Theoderīcus; Greek: Θευδέριχος, romanized: Theuderichos), was king of the Ostrogoths (471–526), and ruler of the independent Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy between 493–526,[3] regent of the Visigoths (511–526), and a patrician of the East Roman Empire. As ruler of the combined Gothic realms, Theodoric controlled an empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Adriatic Sea. Though Theodoric himself only  used the title 'king' (rex), some scholars characterize him as a Western Roman Emperor in all but name,[lower-alpha 2] since he ruled large parts of the former Western Roman Empire, had received the former Western imperial regalia from Constantinople in 497, and was referred to by the title augustus by some of his subjects.","image":"Teodorico_re_dei_Goti_(493-526).png.webp"}
