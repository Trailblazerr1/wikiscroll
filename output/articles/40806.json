{"title":"Sinhalese people","summary":"Sinhalese people (Sinhala: සිංහල ජනතාව, romanized: Sinhala Janathāva) are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group of the island of Sri Lanka. They were historically known as Hela people (Sinhala: හෙළ).[12][13] They constitute about 75% of the Sri Lankan population and number greater than 16.2 million.[1][2] The Sinhalese identity is based on language, cultural heritage and nationality. The Sinhalese people speak Sinhala, an insular Indo-Aryan language, and are predominantly Theravada Buddhists,[14] although a minority of Sinhalese follow branches of Christianity and other religions. Since 1815, they were broadly divided into two respective groups: The 'Up-country Sinhalese' in the central mountainous regions, and the 'Low-country Sinhalese' in the coastal regions; although both groups speak the same language, they are distinguished as they observe different cultural customs.[15][16]","image":"King_of_Kandy.svg.png.webp","url":"Sinhalese_people"}
