{"title":"United Ireland","summary":"United Ireland, also referred to as Irish reunification,[1][2][3] is the proposition that all of Ireland should be a single sovereign state.[4][5] At present, the island is divided politically; the sovereign Republic of Ireland has jurisdiction over the majority of Ireland, while Northern Ireland, which lies entirely within (but does not constitute the entirety of) the Irish province of Ulster, is part of the United Kingdom. Achieving a united Ireland is a central tenet of Irish nationalism, particularly of both mainstream and dissident Irish republican political and paramilitary organisations.[6] Unionists support Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, and therefore oppose Irish unification.[7][8]","image":"Map_of_Ireland's_capitals.png.webp","url":"United_Ireland"}
