{"title":"Transcription (biology)","summary":"Transcription is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA.  The segments of DNA transcribed into RNA molecules that can encode proteins are said to produce messenger RNA (mRNA).  Other segments of DNA are copied into RNA molecules called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs).  Averaged over multiple cell types in a given tissue, the quantity of mRNA is more than 10 times the quantity of ncRNA (though in particular single cell types ncRNAs may exceed mRNAs).[1]  The general preponderance of mRNA in cells is valid even though less than 2% of the human genome can be transcribed into mRNA (Human genome#Coding vs. noncoding DNA), while at least 80% of mammalian genomic DNA can be actively transcribed (in one or more types of cells), with the majority of this 80% considered to be ncRNA.[2]","image":"MRNA.svg.png.webp","url":"Transcription_(biology)"}
