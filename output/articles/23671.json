{"title":"John Ford filmography","summary":"John Ford (1894–1973) was an American film director whose career spanned from 1913 to 1971.[1] During this time he directed more than 140 films. Born in Maine, Ford entered the filmmaking industry shortly after graduating from high school with the help of his older brother, Francis Ford, who had established himself as a leading man and director for Universal Studios.[2] After working as an actor, assistant director, stuntman, and prop man – often for his brother – Universal gave Ford the opportunity to direct in 1917.[3]  Initially working in short films, he quickly moved into features, largely with Harry Carey as his star.[4] In 1920 Ford left Universal and began working for the Fox Film Corporation.[5] During the next ten years he directed more than 30 films, including the westerns The Iron Horse (1924) and 3 Bad Men (1926), both starring George O'Brien,[6] the war drama Four Sons and the Irish romantic drama Hangman's House (both 1928 and both starring Victor McLaglen).[7]  In the same year of these last two films, Ford directed his first all-talking film, the short Napoleon's Barber.[8]  The following year he directed his first all-talking feature, The Black Watch.[9]","image":"John_Ford%2C_1946.jpg.webp","url":"John_Ford_filmography"}
