{"title":"Arithmetic mean","summary":"In mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean ( /ˌærɪθˈmɛtɪk ˈmiːn/, stress on first and third syllables of \"arithmetic\"), or simply the mean or the average (when the context is clear), is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection.[1] The collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study, or frequently a set of results from a survey. The term \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics, because it helps distinguish it from other means, such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean.","image":"c09e28c409c45c4ee539208dc40e404f3c111724.svg","url":"Arithmetic_mean"}
