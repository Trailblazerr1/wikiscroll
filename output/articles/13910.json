{"title":"EPCR Challenge Cup","summary":"The EPCR Challenge Cup is an annual European rugby union competition organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR).[1] It is the second-tier competition for European clubs behind the European Rugby Champions Cup. From its inception in 1996 to 2014, it was known as the European Challenge Cup and governed by European Rugby Cup (ERC). Following disagreements in the structure of the tournament's format and division of revenue, the English and French leagues withdrew to form the EPCR, which organized the Challenge Cup and the Champions Cup since the 2014â€“15 season.[2]","image":"Rugby_football_current_event.svg.png.webp"}
