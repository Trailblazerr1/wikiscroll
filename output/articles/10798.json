{"title":"Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership","summary":"The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), also known as TPP11 or TPP-11,[3][4][5][6] is a trade agreement among Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. It evolved from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which never entered into force due to the withdrawal of the United States. The eleven signatories have combined economies representing 13.4 percent of global gross domestic product, at approximately US$13.5 trillion, making the CPTPP one of the world's largest free-trade areas by GDP, along with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement, the European Single Market,[7] and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.","image":"Comprehensive_and_Progressive_Agreement_for_Trans-Pacific_Partnership_members.svg.png.webp"}
