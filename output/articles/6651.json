{"title":"Biofilm","summary":"A biofilm comprises any syntrophic consortium of microorganisms in which cells stick to each other and often also to a surface.[2][3] These adherent cells become embedded within a slimy extracellular matrix that is composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs).[2][3] The cells within the biofilm produce the EPS components, which are typically a polymeric conglomeration of extracellular polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and DNA.[2][3][4] Because they have three-dimensional structure and represent a community lifestyle for microorganisms, they have been metaphorically described as \"cities for microbes\".[5][6]","image":"Staphylococcus_aureus_biofilm_01.jpg.webp"}
