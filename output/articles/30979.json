{"title":"My Belarusy","summary":"The \"State Anthem of the Republic of Belarus\" (Belarusian: Дзяржаўны гімн Рэспублікі Беларусь), better known as \"My Belarusy\" (Мы, беларусы; \"We Belarusians\"), is the national anthem of Belarus. It was originally written in the 1940s and adopted in 1955 for use in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.[1] The music of the Byelorussian SSR's regional anthem was composed by Niescier Sakałoŭski and the lyrics were written by Michas Klimkovič. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the music composed by Sakalowski was kept and the lyrics were discarded. New lyrics, which were written by Klimkovič and Uladzimir Karyzna,[2] were adopted by a presidential decree issued on 2 July 2002. The lyrics now speak of a friendly Belarus, honoring past military battles and looking forward to the future.","image":"My_Belarusy_1.png.webp","url":"My_Belarusy"}
