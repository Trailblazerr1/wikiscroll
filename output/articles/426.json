It featured the 2007 FIA Formula One World Championship, which began on 18 March and ended on 21 October after seventeen events. The Drivers' Championship was won by Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen by one point at the final race of the season, making Räikkönen the third Finnish driver to take the title.  An appeal by McLaren regarding the legality of some cars in the final race could have altered the championship standings,[1] but on 16 November, the appeal was rejected by the International Court of Appeal, confirming the championship results.[2] Räikkönen entered the final race in third position in the drivers' standings, but emerged as champion after the chequered flag, a feat first accomplished by Giuseppe Farina in 1950.","image":"Kimi_Raikkonen.jpg.webp","url":"2007_Formula_One_World_Championship"}
