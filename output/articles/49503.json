{"title":"Zinc finger","summary":"A zinc finger is a small protein structural motif that is characterized by the coordination of one or more zinc ions (Zn2+) in order to stabilize the fold. It was originally coined to describe the finger-like appearance of a hypothesized structure from the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) transcription factor IIIA. However, it has been found to encompass a wide variety of differing protein structures in eukaryotic cells.[1] Xenopus laevis TFIIIA was originally demonstrated to contain zinc and require the metal for function in 1983, the first such reported zinc requirement for a gene regulatory protein[2][3] followed soon thereafter by the Kr√ºppel factor in Drosophila.[4] It often appears as a metal-binding domain in multi-domain proteins.[3]","image":"Zinc_finger_rendered.png.webp","url":"Zinc_finger"}
