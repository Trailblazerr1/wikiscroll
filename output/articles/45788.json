{"title":"Translation","summary":"Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text.[1] The English language draws a terminological distinction (which does not exist in every language) between translating (a written text) and interpreting (oral or signed communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community.","image":"Charles_V_ordonnant_la_traduction_d'Aristote_copy.jpg.webp","url":"Translation"}
