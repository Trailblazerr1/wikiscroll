{"title":"Glycated hemoglobin","summary":"Glycated hemoglobin (glycohemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, less commonly HbA1c, HgbA1c, Hb1c, etc., also A1C informally with patients[1]) is a form of hemoglobin (Hb) that is chemically linked to a sugar. Most monosaccharides, including glucose, galactose and fructose, spontaneously (i.e. non-enzymatically) bond with hemoglobin, when present in the bloodstream of humans. However, glucose is less likely to do so than galactose and fructose (13% that of fructose and 21% that of galactose), which may explain why glucose is used as the primary metabolic fuel in humans.[2][3]","image":"GlycationViaAmadoriRgmt.svg.png.webp","url":"Glycated_hemoglobin"}
