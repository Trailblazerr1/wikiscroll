{"title":"Pronghorn","summary":"The pronghorn (UK: /ˈprɒŋhɔːrn/, US: /ˈprɔːŋ-/)[3] (Antilocapra americana) is a species of artiodactyl (even-toed, hoofed) mammal indigenous to interior western and central North America. Though not a true antelope, it is known colloquially in North America as the American antelope, prong buck, pronghorn antelope, prairie antelope, or simply antelope[4] because it closely resembles the antelopes of the Old World and fills a similar ecological niche due to parallel evolution.[5] It is the only surviving member of the family Antilocapridae.[6]","image":"Antilocapra_americana.jpg.webp","url":"Pronghorn"}
