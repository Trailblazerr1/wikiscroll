{"title":"Flood myth","summary":"A flood myth or deluge myth is a myth in which a great flood, usually sent by a deity or deities, destroys civilization, often in an act of divine retribution. Parallels are often drawn between the flood waters of these myths and the primaeval waters which appear in certain creation myths, as the flood waters are described as a measure for the cleansing of humanity, in preparation for rebirth. Most flood myths also contain a culture hero, who \"represents the human craving for life\".[1]","image":"Gustave_Dor√©_-_The_Holy_Bible_-_Plate_I%2C_The_Deluge.jpg.webp","url":"Flood_myth"}
