{"title":"Themistocles","summary":"Themistocles (/θəˈmɪstəkliːz/; Greek: Θεμιστοκλῆς [tʰemistoklɛ̂ːs]; \"Glory of the Law\";[3] c. 524–459 BC)[1][2] was an Athenian politician and general. He was one of a new breed of non-aristocratic politicians who rose to prominence in the early years of the Athenian democracy. As a politician, Themistocles was a populist, having the support of lower-class Athenians, and generally being at odds with the Athenian nobility. Elected archon in 493 BC, he convinced the polis to increase the naval power of Athens, a recurring theme in his political career. During the first Persian invasion of Greece he fought at the Battle of Marathon[4] (490 BC) and was possibly one of the ten Athenian strategoi (generals) in that battle.","image":"Illustrerad_Verldshistoria_band_I_Ill_116.png.webp"}
