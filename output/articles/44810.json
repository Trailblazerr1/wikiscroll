{"title":"Themis","summary":"Themis (/ˈθiːmɪs/; Ancient Greek: Θέμις) is an ancient Greek Goddess of justice, one of the twelve Titan children born to Gaia and Uranus. She is described as \"[the Lady] of good counsel,\" and is the personification of divine order, fairness, law, natural law, and custom. Her symbols are the Scales of Justice, tools used to remain balanced and pragmatic. Themis means \"divine law\" rather than human ordinance, literally \"that which is put in place\", from the Greek verb títhēmi (τίθημι), meaning \"to put.\"","image":"0029MAN-Themis.jpg.webp"}
