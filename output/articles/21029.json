{"title":"Human leg","summary":"The human leg, in the general word sense, is the entire lower limb[1][2] of the human body, including the foot, thigh and even the hip or gluteal region. However, the definition in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle, also known as the crus[3][4][5] or, especially in non-technical use, the shank.[6] Legs are used for standing, and all forms of locomotion including recreational such as dancing, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass. Female legs generally have greater hip anteversion and tibiofemoral angles, but shorter femur and tibial lengths than those in males.[7]","image":"Gray1240.png.webp"}
