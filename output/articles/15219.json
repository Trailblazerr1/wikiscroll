{"title":"Ethics of eating meat","summary":"The ethics of eating meat is to question of whether it is right to eat animal flesh; it is among the most prominent topics in food ethics.[1] People choose not to eat meat for various reasons such as religion, concern for animal welfare, the environmental impact of meat production (environmental vegetarianism), health considerations[2] and antimicrobial resistance, which England's former chief medical officer Sally Davies said is as menacing as climate change.[3] Some argue that slaughtering animals solely because people enjoy the taste of meat is morally wrong or unjustifiable.[4][5] Vegans often abstain from other animal products for these reasons and/or because of opposition to industrial livestock production. For example, 95% of egg-laying hens in the United States are kept in wire battery cages, where their average living space is smaller than a standard piece of paper. This causes them to attack each other, so their beaks are cut off without anaesthetic.[6] Ethical vegetarians and ethical vegans[7] may also object to the practices underlying the production of meat, or cite concerns about animal welfare, animal rights, environmental ethics, and religious reasons. In response, some proponents of meat-eating have adduced various scientific, cultural, and religious arguments in support of the practice. Some meat-eaters only object to rearing animals in certain ways, such as in factory farms, or killing them with cruelty; others avoid only certain meats, such as veal or foie gras.","image":"Paw_(Animal_Rights_symbol).svg.png.webp","url":"Ethics_of_eating_meat"}
