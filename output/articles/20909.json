{"title":"Howard Hughes","summary":"Howard Robard Hughes Jr. (December 24, 1905 – April 5, 1976) was a USA business magnate, investor, record-setting pilot, engineer,[2] film director, and philanthropist, known during his lifetime as one of the most influential and financially successful individuals in the world. He first became prominent as a film producer, and then as an important figure in the aviation industry. Later in life, he became known for his eccentric behavior and reclusive lifestyle—oddities that were caused in part by his worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), chronic pain from a near-fatal plane crash, and increasing deafness.","image":"Howard_Hughes_1938.jpg.webp"}
