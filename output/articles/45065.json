{"title":"Thrombosis","summary":"Thrombosis (from Ancient Greek θρόμβωσις thrómbōsis \"clotting”) is the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, obstructing the flow of blood through the circulatory system. When a blood vessel (a vein or an artery) is injured, the body uses platelets (thrombocytes) and fibrin to form a blood clot to prevent blood loss.  Even when a blood vessel is not injured, blood clots may form in the body under certain conditions. A clot, or a piece of the clot, that breaks free and begins to travel around the body is known as an embolus.[1][2]","image":"Arterial_thrombosis_causing_cyanosis.jpg.webp","url":"Thrombosis"}
