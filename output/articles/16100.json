{"title":"Field-effect transistor","summary":"The field-effect transistor (FET) is a type of transistor that uses an electric field to control the flow of current in a semiconductor.  FETs are devices with three terminals: source, gate, and drain. FETs control the flow of current by the application of a voltage to the gate, which in turn alters the  conductivity between the drain and source.","image":"FET_cross_section.png.webp","url":"Field-effect_transistor"}
