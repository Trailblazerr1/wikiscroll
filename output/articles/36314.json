{"title":"Protein targeting","summary":"Protein targeting or protein sorting is the biological mechanism by which proteins are transported to their appropriate destinations within or outside the cell.[1] Proteins can be targeted to the inner space of an organelle, different intracellular membranes, the plasma membrane, or to the exterior of the cell via secretion.[1] Information contained in the protein itself directs this delivery process.[2] Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors have been linked to multiple disease-states.[3][4]","image":"Gunter_Blobel_2008_3.JPG.webp"}
