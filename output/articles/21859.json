{"title":"Indianapolis Museum of Art","summary":"The Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) is an encyclopedic art museum located at Newfields, a 152-acre (62Â ha) campus that also houses Lilly House, The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park: 100 Acres, the Gardens at Newfields, the Beer Garden, and more. It is located at the corner of North Michigan Road and West 38th Street, about three miles north of downtown Indianapolis, northwest of Crown Hill Cemetery. There are exhibitions, classes, tours, and events, many of which change seasonally. The entire campus was previously referred to as the Indianapolis Museum of Art, but in 2017 the campus and organization were renamed \"Newfields\" to better reflect the breadth of offerings and venues. The \"Indianapolis Museum of Art\" now specifically refers to the main art museum building that acts as the cornerstone of the campus, as well as the legal name of the organization doing business as Newfields.[3]","image":"IndianapolisMuseumofArt.jpg.webp"}
