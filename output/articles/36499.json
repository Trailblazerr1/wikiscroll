{"title":"Pulmonary contusion","summary":"A pulmonary contusion, also known as lung contusion, is a bruise of the lung, caused by chest trauma. As a result of damage to capillaries, blood and other fluids accumulate in the lung tissue.  The excess fluid interferes with gas exchange, potentially leading to inadequate oxygen levels (hypoxia).  Unlike pulmonary laceration, another type of lung injury, pulmonary contusion does not involve a cut or tear of the lung tissue.","image":"Pulmonary_contusion_CT_arrow.jpg.webp","url":"Pulmonary_contusion"}
