{"title":"A","summary":"A, or a, is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.[1][2] Its name in English is a (pronounced /ˈeɪ/), plural aes.[nb 1] It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives.[3] The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.","image":"A_cursiva.gif"}
