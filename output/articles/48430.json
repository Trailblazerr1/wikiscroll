{"title":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (British game show)","summary":"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? is a British television quiz show, created by David Briggs for ITV. The programme's format sees contestants taking on multiple-choice questions based upon general knowledge, winning a cash prize for each question they answer correctly, with the amount offered increasing as they take on more difficult questions. If an incorrect answer is given, the contestant will leave with whatever cash prize is guaranteed by the last safety net they have passed, unless they opt to walk away before answering the next question with the money the cash prize they had managed to reach. To assist in the quiz, contestants are given a series of \"lifelines\" to help answer questions.","image":"WWTBAM20thTitle.png.webp"}
