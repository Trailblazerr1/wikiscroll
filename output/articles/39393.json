{"title":"Saola","summary":"The saola (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis), also called spindlehorn, Asian unicorn, or infrequently, Vu Quang bovid, is one of the world's rarest large mammals, a forest-dwelling bovine native to the Annamite Range in Vietnam and Laos. It was described in 1993 following a discovery of remains in VÅ© Quang Nature Reserve by a joint survey of the Vietnamese Ministry of Forestry and the World Wide Fund for Nature.[2][3][4] Saolas have since been kept in captivity multiple times, although only for short periods. A living wild saola was first photographed in 1999 by a camera trap set by WWF and the Vietnamese government's Forest Protection Department.[5][6]","image":"Pseudoryx_nghetinhensis%2C_b.PNG.webp"}
