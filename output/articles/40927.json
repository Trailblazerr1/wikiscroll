{"title":"Skyscraper","summary":"A skyscraper is a tall continuously habitable building having multiple floors. Modern sources currently define skyscrapers as being at least 100 metres[1] or 150 metres[2] in height, though there is no universally accepted definition. Skyscrapers are very tall high-rise buildings.  Historically, the term first referred to buildings with between 10 and 20 stories when these types of buildings began to be constructed in the 1880s.[3] Skyscrapers may host offices, hotels, residential spaces, and retail spaces.","image":"Burj_Khalifa.jpg.webp"}
