{"title":"Wave function","summary":"A wave function in quantum physics is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system.  The wave function is a complex-valued probability amplitude, and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it.  The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters ψ and Ψ (lower-case and capital psi, respectively).","image":"QuantumHarmonicOscillatorAnimation.gif"}
