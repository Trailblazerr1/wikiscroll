{"title":"Oxford Movement","summary":"The Oxford Movement was a movement of High Church members of the Church of England which eventually developed into Anglo-Catholicism. The movement, whose original devotees were mostly associated with the University of Oxford, argued for the reinstatement of some older Christian traditions of faith and their inclusion into Anglican liturgy and theology. They thought of Anglicanism as one of three branches of the \"one, holy, catholic, and apostolic\" Christian church. By the 1840s many participants decided that the Anglican Church lacked grace, and converted to Roman Catholicism.","image":"Edward_Bouverie_Pusey.jpg.webp","url":"Oxford_Movement"}
