{"title":"Run batted in","summary":"A run batted in (RBI; plural RBIs [1]) is a statistic in baseball and softball that credits a batter for making a play that allows a run to be scored (except in certain situations such as when an error is made on the play). For example, if the batter bats a base hit which allows a teammate on a higher base to reach home and so score a run, then the batter gets credited with an RBI.","image":"Pujols2019_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
