{"title":"Treblinka extermination camp","summary":"Treblinka (pronounced [trɛˈblʲinka]) was an extermination camp, built and operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II.[2] It was in a forest north-east of Warsaw, 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) south of the village of Treblinka in what is now the Masovian Voivodeship. The camp operated between 23 July 1942 and 19 October 1943 as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Final Solution.[6] During this time, it is estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews were murdered in its gas chambers,[7][8] along with 2,000 Romani people.[9] More Jews were killed at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz-Birkenau.[10]","image":"Treblinka_-_Rail_tracks.JPG.webp","url":"Treblinka_extermination_camp"}
