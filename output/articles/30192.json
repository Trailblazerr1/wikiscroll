{"title":"Mobile app","summary":"A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch. Mobile applications often stand in contrast to desktop applications which are designed to run on desktop computers, and web applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile device.","image":"Flickr_-_The_U.S._Army_-_Official_Army_iPhone_app.jpg.webp"}
