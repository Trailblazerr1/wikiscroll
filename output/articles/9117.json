{"title":"Centrosome","summary":"In cell biology, the centrosome (Latin centrum 'center' + Greek s≈çma 'body') (also called cytocenter[1]) is an organelle that serves as the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) of the animal cell, as well as a regulator of cell-cycle progression. The centrosome provides structure for the cell. The centrosome is thought to have evolved only in the metazoan lineage of eukaryotic cells.[2] Fungi and plants lack centrosomes and therefore use other structures to organize their microtubules.[3][4] Although the centrosome has a key role in efficient mitosis in animal cells, it is not essential in certain fly and flatworm species.[5][6][7]","image":"Centrosome_(borderless_version)-en.svg.png.webp","url":"Centrosome"}
