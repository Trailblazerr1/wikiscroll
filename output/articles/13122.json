{"title":"Discovery (Daft Punk album)","summary":"Discovery is the second studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released internationally 12 March 2001[1] by Virgin Records. It marks a shift from the Chicago house sound prevalent on their first studio record, Homework (1997), to a house style more heavily inspired by disco, post-disco, garage house, and R&B. Comparing their stylistic approach to their previous album, band member Thomas Bangalter described Discovery as an exploration of song structures and musical forms whereas Homework was \"raw\" electronic music. He also described Discovery as a reflection of the duo's childhood memories, when they listened to music with a more playful and innocent viewpoint.","image":"Daft_Punk_-_Discovery.jpg.webp","url":"Discovery_(Daft_Punk_album)"}
