{"title":"North American beaver","summary":"The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) is one of two extant beaver species, along with the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber).[3] It is native to North America and introduced in South America (Patagonia) and Europe (primarily Finland and Karelia). In the United States and Canada, the species is often referred to simply as \"beaver\", though this causes some confusion because another distantly related rodent, Aplodontia rufa, is often called the \"mountain beaver\". Other vernacular names, including American beaver[3] and Canadian beaver,[27] distinguish this species from the other extant beaver species, Castor fiber, which is native to Eurasia. The North American beaver is one of the official national wildlife of Canada symbols and is the official state mammal of Oregon and New York.[28]","image":"American_Beaver.jpg.webp","url":"North_American_beaver"}
