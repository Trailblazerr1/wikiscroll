{"title":"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided","summary":"Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is an action role-playing video game developed by Eidos Montréal and published by Square Enix's European subsidiary in August 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. Versions for Linux and macOS systems were released in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It is the fourth main title in the Deus Ex series, and a sequel to the 2011 game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The gameplay—combining first-person shooter, stealth, and role-playing elements—features exploration and combat in environments connected to the main hub of Prague and quests that grant experience and allow customization of the main character's abilities with Praxis Kits. Conversations between characters have a variety of responses, with options in conversations and at crucial story points affecting how events play out. Players can complete Breach, a cyberspace-set challenge mode, in addition to the main campaign. Breach was later released as a free, standalone product.","image":"Deus_Ex%2C_Mankind_Divided_Box_Art.jpeg.webp","url":"Deus_Ex:_Mankind_Divided"}
