{"title":"War of the Fifth Coalition","summary":"The War of the Fifth Coalition was a European conflict in 1809 that was part of the Napoleonic Wars and the Coalition Wars.  The main conflict took place in central Europe between the Austrian Empire of Francis I and Napoleon's French Empire.  The French were supported by their client states, including the Kingdom of Italy, the Confederation of the Rhine and the Duchy of Warsaw.  Austria was supported by the Fifth Coalition which included the United Kingdom, Portugal, Spain and the Kingdoms of Sardinia and Sicily, though the latter two took no part in the fighting.  By the start of 1809 much of the French army was committed to the Peninsular War against Britain, Spain and Portugal.  After France withdrew 108,000 soldiers from Germany, Austria attacked France to seek the recovery of territories lost in the 1803â€“1806 War of the Third Coalition.  The Austrians hoped Prussia would support them as their former ally, but Prussia chose to remain neutral.","image":"Napoleon_Wagram.jpg.webp"}
