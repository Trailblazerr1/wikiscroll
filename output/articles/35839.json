{"title":"Premarital sex","summary":"Premarital sex  is sexual activity which is practiced by people before they are married. In some period of human history, in some societies, premarital sex has been considered a moral issue which is taboo in many cultures and it is also considered a sin by a number of religions, but since the sexual revolution of the 1960s, it has become accepted by certain liberal movements, especially in Western countries. A 2014 Pew study on global morality found that premarital sex was considered particularly unacceptable in \"Muslim Majority Countries\", such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, and Egypt, each having over 90% disapproval, while people in Western European countries were the most accepting, with Spain, Germany, and France expressing less than 10% disapproval.[1]","image":"Non_marital_by_countries.gif","url":"Premarital_sex"}
