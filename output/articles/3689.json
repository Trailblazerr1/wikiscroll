{"title":"Angles","summary":"The Angles (Old English: Ængle, Engle; Latin: Angli) were one of the main Germanic peoples[2] who settled in Great Britain in the post-Roman period. They founded several kingdoms of the Heptarchy in Anglo-Saxon England, and their name is the root of the name England (\"land of Ængle\"). According to Tacitus, writing before their move to Britain, Angles lived alongside Langobards and Semnones in historical regions of Schleswig and Holstein, which are today part of southern Denmark and northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein).[3]","image":"Anglo-Saxon_Homelands_and_Settlements.svg.png.webp"}
