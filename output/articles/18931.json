{"title":"Green roof","summary":"A green roof or living roof is a roof of a building that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems.[1] Container gardens on roofs, where plants are maintained in pots, are not generally considered to be true green roofs, although this is debated. Rooftop ponds are another form of green roofs which are used to treat greywater.[2] Vegetation, soil, drainage layer, roof barrier and irrigation system constitute green roof.[3]","image":"British_Horse_Society_Head_Quarters_and_Green_Roof.jpg.webp","url":"Green_roof"}
