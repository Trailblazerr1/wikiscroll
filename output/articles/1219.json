{"title":"Hawker Hurricane","summary":"The Hawker Hurricane is a British single-seat fighter aircraft of the 1930sâ€“40s which was designed and predominantly built by Hawker Aircraft Ltd. for service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was overshadowed in the public consciousness by the Supermarine Spitfire's role during the Battle of Britain in 1940, but the Hurricane inflicted 60 percent of the losses sustained by the Luftwaffe in the engagement, and fought in all the major theatres of the Second World War.","image":"Hawker_Hurricane%2C_Battle_of_Britain_Memorial_Flight_Members'_day_2018_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
