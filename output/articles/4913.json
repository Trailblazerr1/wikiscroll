{"title":"Auditory cortex","summary":"The auditory cortex is the part of the temporal lobe that processes auditory information in humans and many other vertebrates. It is a part of the auditory system, performing basic and higher functions in hearing, such as possible relations to language switching.[1][2]  It is located bilaterally, roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes â€“ in humans, curving down and onto the medial surface, on the superior temporal plane, within the lateral sulcus and comprising parts of the transverse temporal gyri, and the superior temporal gyrus, including the planum polare and planum temporale (roughly Brodmann areas 41 and 42, and partially 22).[3][4]","image":"Brodmann_41_42.png.webp","url":"Auditory_cortex"}
