{"title":"Topiary","summary":"Topiary is the horticultural practice of training perennial plants by clipping the foliage and twigs of trees, shrubs and subshrubs to develop and maintain clearly defined shapes,[1] whether geometric or fanciful. The term also refers to plants which have been shaped in this way. As an art form it is a type of living sculpture. The word derives from the Latin word for an ornamental landscape gardener, topiarius, a creator of topia or \"places\", a Greek word that Romans also applied to fictive indoor landscapes executed in fresco.","image":"Rufford_Old_Hall_14.jpg.webp"}
