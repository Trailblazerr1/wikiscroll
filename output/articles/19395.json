{"title":"Hainanese","summary":"Hainanese (Hainan Romanised: Hái-nâm-oe, simplified Chinese: 海南话; traditional Chinese: 海南話; pinyin: Hǎinánhuà), also known as Qióngwén (simplified Chinese: 琼文; traditional Chinese: 瓊文) or Qióngyǔ (琼语; 瓊語),[2] is a group of Min Chinese varieties spoken in the southern Chinese island province of Hainan. In the classification of Yuan Jiahua, it was included in the Southern Min group, being mutually unintelligible with other Southern Min varieties such as Hokkien–Taiwanese and Teochew.[3]  In the classification of Li Rong, used by the Language Atlas of China, it was treated as a separate Min subgroup.[4]  Hou Jingyi combined it with Leizhou Min, spoken on the neighboring mainland Leizhou Peninsula, in a Qiong–Lei group.[5]  \"Hainanese\" is also used for the language of the Li people living in Hainan, but generally refers to Min varieties spoken in Hainan.","image":"Min_dialect_map.svg.png.webp"}
