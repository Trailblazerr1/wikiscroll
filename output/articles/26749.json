{"title":"List of baryons","summary":"Baryons are composite particles made of three quarks, as opposed to mesons, which are composite particles made of one quark and one antiquark. Baryons and mesons are both hadrons, which are particles composed solely of quarks or both quarks and antiquarks. The term baryon is derived from the Greek \"βαρύς\" (barys), meaning \"heavy\", because, at the time of their naming, it was believed that baryons were characterized by having greater masses than other particles that were classed as matter.","image":"Quark_structure_proton.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_baryons"}
