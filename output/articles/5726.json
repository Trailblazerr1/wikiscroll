{"title":"Bass guitar","summary":"The bass guitar, electric bass or simply bass, is the lowest-pitched member of the guitar family. It is a plucked string instrument similar in appearance and construction to an electric or an acoustic guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and typically four to six strings or courses. Since the mid-1950s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the double bass in popular music.","image":"70's_Fender_Jazz_Bass.png.webp","url":"Bass_guitar"}
