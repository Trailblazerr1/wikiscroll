{"title":"Fick's laws of diffusion","summary":"Fick's laws of diffusion describe diffusion and were derived by Adolf Fick in 1855.[1] They can be used to solve for the diffusion coefficient, D. Fick's first law can be used to derive his second law which in turn is identical to the diffusion equation.","image":"DiffusionMicroMacro.gif","url":"Fick's_laws_of_diffusion"}
