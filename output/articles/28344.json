{"title":"Manukau City","summary":"Manukau City was a territorial authority district in Auckland, New Zealand, that was governed by the Manukau City Council. The area is sometimes referred to as \"South Auckland\", although this term never possessed official recognition and does not encompass areas such as East Auckland, which was within the city boundary. It was a relatively young city, both in terms of legal status and large-scale settlement – though in June 2010, it was the third largest in New Zealand, and the fastest growing.[1] In the same year, the entire Auckland Region was amalgamated under a single city authority, Auckland Council.","image":"Manukau_Skyline_In_Twilight.jpg.webp"}
