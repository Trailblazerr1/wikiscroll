{"title":"Charles Fourier","summary":"François Marie Charles Fourier (/ˈfʊrieɪ, -iər/;[2]French: [ʃaʁl fuʁje]; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French philosopher, an influential early socialist thinker and one of the founders of utopian socialism. Some of Fourier's social and moral views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream thinking in modern society. For instance, Fourier is credited with having originated the word feminism in 1837.[3]","image":"Françoise_Foliot_-_Jean_Gigoux_-_Portrait_de_Charles_Fourrier_(cropped)_(1).jpg.webp"}
