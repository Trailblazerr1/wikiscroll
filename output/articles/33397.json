{"title":"Osteoclast","summary":"An osteoclast (from Ancient Greek  ὀστέον (osteon) 'bone', and  κλαστός (clastos) 'broken') is a type of bone cell that breaks down bone tissue.  This function is critical in the maintenance, repair, and remodeling of bones of the vertebral skeleton. The osteoclast disassembles and digests the composite of hydrated protein and mineral at a molecular level by secreting acid and a collagenase, a process known as bone resorption. This process also helps regulate the level of blood calcium.","image":"Osteoclast.jpg.webp"}
