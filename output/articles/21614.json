After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.","image":"Head_Odysseus_MAR_Sperlonga.jpg.webp","url":"Il_ritorno_d'Ulisse_in_patria"}
