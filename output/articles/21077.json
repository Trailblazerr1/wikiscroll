{"title":"Humorist","summary":"A humorist (American) or humourist (British spelling) is an intellectual who uses humor, or wit, in writing or public speaking, but is not an artist who seeks only to elicit laughs.[1] Humorists are distinct from comedians, who are show business entertainers whose business is to make an audience laugh. It is possible to play both roles in the course of a career.","image":"Mark_Twain_by_AF_Bradley.jpg.webp"}
