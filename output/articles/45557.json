{"title":"Torque converter","summary":"A torque converter is a type of fluid coupling that transfers rotating power from a prime mover, like an internal combustion engine, to a rotating driven load.  In a vehicle with an automatic transmission, the torque converter connects the power source to the load. It is usually located between the engine's flexplate and the transmission. The equivalent location in a manual transmission would be the mechanical clutch.","image":"Bauma_2007_ZF_Drehmomentwandler.jpg.webp"}
