{"title":"Svan language","summary":"Svan (ლუშნუ ნინ lušnu nin; Georgian: სვანური ენა, romanized: svanuri ena) is a Kartvelian language spoken in the western Georgian region of Svaneti primarily by the Svan people.[2][3] With its speakers variously estimated to be between 30,000 and 80,000, the UNESCO designates Svan as a \"definitely endangered language\".[4] It is of particular interest because it has retained many archaic features that have been lost in the other Kartvelian languages.","image":"Kartvelian_languages.svg.png.webp"}
