{"title":"Ingrown nail","summary":"An ingrown nail, also known as onychocryptosis from Greek: ὄνυξ (onyx) 'nail' and κρυπτός (kryptos) 'hidden', is a common form of nail disease. It is an often painful condition in which the nail grows so that it cuts into one or both sides of the paronychium or nail bed. While ingrown nails can occur in the nails of both the hands and the feet, they occur most commonly with the toenails (as opposed to fingernails), and for the most part are only problematic and painful on the big toe.","image":"Ingrown_nail_002_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Ingrown_nail"}
