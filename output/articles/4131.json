{"title":"Appendix (anatomy)","summary":"The appendix (or vermiform appendix; also cecal [or caecal] appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo. The cecum is a pouch-like structure of the colon, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. The term \"vermiform\" comes from Latin and means \"worm-shaped.\" The appendix used to be considered a vestigial organ, but this view has changed over the past decades.[1] Recent research suggests that the appendix may serve an important purpose. In particular, it may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.","image":"Appendix_locations.svg.png.webp"}
