{"title":"Incarnation (Christianity)","summary":"In Christian theology, the incarnation is the belief that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, also known as God the Son or the Logos (Koine Greek for \"word\"), \"was made flesh\"[1] by being conceived in the womb of a woman, the Virgin Mary, also known as the Theotokos (Greek for \"God-bearer\"). The doctrine of the incarnation, then, entails that Jesus is fully God and fully human.","image":"Jesusicon.jpg.webp"}
