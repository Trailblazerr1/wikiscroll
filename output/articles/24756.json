{"title":"Killing of Walter Scott","summary":"On April 4, 2015, Walter Scott, a 50-year old black man, was murdered by Michael Slager, a local police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina. Slager had stopped Scott for a non-functioning brake light.[1][2] Slager was charged with murder after a video surfaced showing him shooting Scott from behind while Scott was fleeing, which contradicted Slager's report of the incident. The racial difference led many to believe that the shooting was racially motivated, generating a widespread controversy.[3]","image":"Shooting_of_Walter_Scott.jpeg.webp","url":"Killing_of_Walter_Scott"}
