{"title":"Great Bengal famine of 1770","summary":"The Bengal Famine of 1770 (Bengali: Chiẏāttôrer mônnôntôr, lit. The Famine of 76) was a famine that struck the Bengal region between 1769 and 1770 (1176 to 1177 in the Bengali calendar) and affected some 30 million people.[2] It occurred during a period of dual governance in Bengal.  This existed after the East India Company had been granted the diwani, or the right to collect revenue in Bengal by the Mughal emperor in Delhi,[3][4] but before it had wrested the nizamat, or control of civil administration, which continued to lie with the Mughal governor, the Nawab of Bengal.[5]","image":"IGI1908India1765a.jpg.webp","url":"Great_Bengal_famine_of_1770"}
