{"title":"Viaduct","summary":"A viaduct is a specific type of bridge that consists of a series of arches, piers or columns supporting a long elevated railway or road. Typically a viaduct connects two points of roughly equal elevation, allowing direct overpass across a wide valley, road, river, or other low-lying terrain features and obstacles.[1][2] The term viaduct is derived from the Latin via meaning \"road\", and ducere meaning \"to lead\". It is a 19th-century derivation from an analogy with ancient Roman aqueducts.[1] Like the Roman aqueducts, many early viaducts comprised a series of arches of roughly equal length.","image":"Laighmilton1.JPG.webp"}
