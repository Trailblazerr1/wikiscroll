{"title":"Electronic filter","summary":"Electronic filters are a type of signal processing filter in the form of electrical circuits.  This article covers those filters consisting of lumped electronic components, as opposed to distributed-element filters.  That is, using components and interconnections that, in analysis, can be considered to exist at a single point.  These components can be in discrete packages or part of an integrated circuit.","image":"Hilofilter.agr.jpg.webp","url":"Electronic_filter"}
