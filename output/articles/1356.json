{"title":"Moldovan language","summary":"Moldovan (Latin alphabet: limba moldovenească; Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet: лимба молдовеняскэ), also known historically as Moldavian, is one of the two names of the Romanian language in Moldova.[3][4] \"Moldovan\" is declared the official language in Article 13 of the constitution adopted in 1994,[5] while the 1991 Declaration of Independence of Moldova uses the name \"Romanian.\" In 2003, the Moldovan parliament adopted a law defining \"Moldovan\" and \"Romanian\" as designations for the same language (glottonyms).[6] In 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova interpreted that Article 13 of the constitution is superseded by the Declaration of Independence,[7] thus giving official status to the name \"Romanian.\"[8][9] The breakaway region of Transnistria continues to recognize \"Moldovan\" as one of its official languages, alongside Russian and Ukrainian.[10]","image":"Flag_of_Moldova.svg.png.webp"}
