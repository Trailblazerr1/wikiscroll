{"title":".30-06 Springfield","summary":"The 30-06 Springfield cartridge (pronounced \"thirty-ought-six\" IPA: [ˈθɝɾi ɔt sɪks]), 7.62×63mm in metric notation and called \"30 Gov't '06\" by Winchester,[4] was introduced to the United States Army in 1906 and later standardized; it remained in use until the late 1970s. The \"30\" refers to the caliber of the bullet in inches. The \"06\" refers to the year the cartridge was adopted, 1906. It replaced the 30-03, 6mm Lee Navy, and 30-40 Krag cartridges. The 30-06 remained the U.S. Army's primary rifle and machine gun cartridge for nearly 50 years before being replaced by the 7.62×51mm NATO and 5.56×45mm NATO, both of which remain in current U.S. and NATO service. It remains a very popular sporting round, with ammunition produced by all major manufacturers.","image":"30-06_Springfield_rifle_cartridge.jpg.webp"}
