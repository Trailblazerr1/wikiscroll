{"title":"Irenaeus","summary":"Irenaeus (/ɪrɪˈneɪəs/; Greek: Εἰρηναῖος Eirēnaios; c. 130 – c. 202 AD)[3] was a Greek bishop noted for his role in guiding and expanding Christian communities in the southern regions of present-day France and, more widely, for the development of Christian theology by combating heresy and defining orthodoxy. Originating from Smyrna, he had seen and heard the preaching of Polycarp,[4] who in turn was said to have heard John the Evangelist,[5] and thus was the last known living connection with the Apostles.","image":"Saint_Irenaeus.jpg.webp","url":"Irenaeus"}
