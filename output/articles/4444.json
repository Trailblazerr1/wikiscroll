{"title":"Arrhythmia","summary":"Arrhythmias, also known as cardiac arrhythmias, heart arrhythmias, or dysrhythmias, are irregularities in the heartbeat, including when it is too fast or too slow.[2] A heart rate that is too fast – above 100 beats per minute in adults – is called tachycardia, and a heart rate that is too slow – below 60 beats per minute – is called bradycardia.[2] Some types of arrhythmias have no symptoms.[1] Symptoms, when present, may include palpitations or feeling a pause between heartbeats.[1] In more serious cases, there may be lightheadedness, passing out, shortness of breath or chest pain.[1] While most cases of arrhythmia are not serious, some predispose a person to complications such as stroke or heart failure.[2][3] Others may result in sudden death.[3]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Arrhythmia"}
