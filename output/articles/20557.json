{"title":"History of the Jews in Latvia","summary":"The history of the Jews in Latvia dates back to the first Jewish colony established in Piltene in 1571.[2] Jews contributed to Latvia's development until the Northern War (1700â€“1721), which decimated Latvia's population.[3] The Jewish community reestablished itself in the 18th century, mainly through an influx from Prussia, and came to play a principal role in the economic life of Latvia.[2]","image":"Flag_of_Latvia.svg.png.webp"}
