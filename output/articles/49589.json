{"title":"Æthelbald of Mercia","summary":"Æthelbald (also spelled Ethelbald or Aethelbald;[1] died 757) was the King of Mercia, in what is now the English Midlands from 716 until he was killed in 757. Æthelbald was the son of Alweo and thus a grandson of King Eowa. Æthelbald came to the throne after the death of his cousin, King Ceolred, who had driven him into exile. During his long reign, Mercia became the dominant kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons, and recovered the position of pre-eminence it had enjoyed during the strong reigns of Mercian kings Penda and Wulfhere between about 628 and 675.","image":"The_Repton_Stone-_detail.JPG.webp","url":"Æthelbald_of_Mercia"}
