{"title":"Hemolytic–uremic syndrome","summary":"Hemolytic–uremic syndrome (HUS) is a group of blood disorders characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney failure, and low platelets.[1][3] Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness.[1][2] Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses.[1] Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications.[6] Adults, specially the elderly, may present a more complicated presentation.[2][6] Complications may include neurological problems and heart failure.[1]","image":"Schizocyte_smear_2009-12-22.JPG.webp","url":"Hemolytic–uremic_syndrome"}
