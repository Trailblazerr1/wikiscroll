{"title":"Constitution of the Roman Republic","summary":"The constitution of the Roman Republic was a set of uncodified norms and customs which,[1] together with various written laws,[2] guided the procedural governance of the Roman Republic. The constitution emerged from that of the Roman kingdom, evolved substantively and significantly—almost to the point of unrecognisability[3]—over the almost five hundred years of the republic. The collapse of republican government and norms from 133 BC would lead to the rise of Augustus and his principate.[4]","image":"Roman_SPQR_banner.svg.png.webp","url":"Constitution_of_the_Roman_Republic"}
