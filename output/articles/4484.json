{"title":"Arterial blood gas test","summary":"An arterial blood gas (ABG) test measures the amounts of arterial gases, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. An ABG test requires that a small volume of blood be drawn from the radial artery with a syringe and a thin needle,[1] but sometimes the femoral artery in the groin or another site is used. The blood can also be drawn from an arterial catheter.","image":"Davenport_fig_10.jpg.webp","url":"Arterial_blood_gas_test"}
