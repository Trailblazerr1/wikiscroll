{"title":"Tear gas","summary":"Tear gas, also known as a lachrymator agent or lachrymator (from the Latin lacrima meaning \"tear\"), sometimes colloquially known as \"mace\" after an early commercial aerosol, is a chemical weapon that stimulates the nerves of the lacrimal gland in the eye to produce tears. In addition, it can cause severe eye and respiratory pain, skin irritation, bleeding, and blindness. Common lachrymators both currently and formerly used as tear gas include pepper spray (OC gas), PAVA spray (nonivamide), CS gas, CR gas, CN gas (phenacyl chloride), bromoacetone, xylyl bromide and Mace (a branded mixture).","image":"Police_fighting_against_anti-Sarkozy_with_tear_gas_(487645695).jpg.webp","url":"Tear_gas"}
