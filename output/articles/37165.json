{"title":"Rapture","summary":"The rapture is an eschatological theological position held by some Christians, particularly within branches of American evangelicalism, consisting of an end-time event when all Christian believers who are alive, along with resurrected believers, will rise \"in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.\"[1] The origin of the term extends from Paul the Apostle's First Epistle to the Thessalonians in the Bible, in which he uses the Greek word harpazo (Ancient Greek: ἁρπάζω), meaning \"to snatch away\" or \"to seize,\" and explains that believers in Jesus Christ will be snatched away from earth into the air.[2]","image":"Teachings_of_Jesus_40_of_40._the_rapture._one_in_the_bed._Jan_Luyken_etching._Bowyer_Bible.gif","url":"Rapture"}
