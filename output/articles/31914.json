{"title":"New Zealand parrot","summary":"The New Zealand parrot superfamily, Strigopoidea,[1] consists of at least three genera of parrots – Nestor, Strigops, the fossil Nelepsittacus,[2][3] and probably the fossil Heracles.[4] The genus Nestor consists of the kea, kākā, Norfolk Island kaka and Chatham Island kaka,[5][6] while the genus Strigops contains the iconic kākāpō.[5] All extant species are endemic to New Zealand. The species of the genus Nelepsittacus were endemics of the main islands, while the two extinct species of the genus Nestor were found at the nearby oceanic islands such as Chatham Island of New Zealand, and Norfolk Island and adjacent Phillip Island.","image":"Kaka-Parrots.jpg.webp"}
