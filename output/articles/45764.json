{"title":"Transform fault","summary":"A transform fault or  transform boundary, sometimes called a strike-slip boundary, is a fault along a plate boundary where the motion is predominantly horizontal.[1] It ends abruptly where it connects to another plate boundary, either another transform, a spreading ridge, or a subduction zone.[2] A transform fault is a special case of a strike-slip fault that also forms a plate boundary.","image":"Continental-continental_conservative_plate_boundary_opposite_directions.svg.png.webp"}
