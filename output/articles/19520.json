{"title":"Han Feizi","summary":"The Han Feizi (Chinese: 韓非子) is an ancient Chinese text attributed to foundational political philosopher Han Fei.[1] It comprises a selection of essays in the Legalist tradition on theories of state power, synthesizing the methodologies of his predecessors.[2] Its 55 chapters, most of which date to the Warring States period mid-3rd century BC, are the only such text to survive intact.[3][2] Easily one of the most important philosophical classics in ancient China,[4] it touches on administration, diplomacy, war and economics,[5] and is also valuable for its abundance of anecdotes about pre-Qin China.","image":"Hanfeizi_or_Han_Feizi%2C_Qing_dynasty%2C_Hunan_Museum.jpg.webp"}
