{"title":"Discogs","summary":"Discogs (short for discographies) is a website and crowdsourced database of information about audio recordings, including commercial releases, promotional releases, and bootleg or off-label releases. While the site was originally created with a goal of becoming the largest online database of electronic music,[2] the site now includes releases in all genres on all formats. After the database was opened to contributions from the public, rock music began to become the most prevalent genre listed.[3] As of 12 August 2021 Discogs contains over 14.2 million releases, by over 7.6 million artists, across over 1.3 million labels, contributed from over 595,000 contributor user accounts — with these figures constantly growing as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time.[4][5] The Discogs servers, currently hosted under the domain name discogs.com, are owned by Zink Media, Inc. and located in Portland, Oregon, United States.[6]","image":"Discogs_logo.svg.png.webp"}
