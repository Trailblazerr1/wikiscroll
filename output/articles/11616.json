{"title":"Crystal system","summary":"In crystallography, the terms crystal system, crystal family, and lattice system each refer to one of several classes of space groups, lattices, point groups, or crystals. Informally, two crystals are in the same crystal system if they have similar symmetries, although there are many exceptions to this.","image":"Carbon_lattice_diamond.png.webp","url":"Crystal_system"}
