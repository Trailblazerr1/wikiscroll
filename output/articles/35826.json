{"title":"Prefecture-level city","summary":"A prefectural-level municipality (Chinese: 地级市), prefectural-level city or prefectural city; formerly known as a province-administrated city (Chinese: 省辖市) from 1949 to 1983, is an administrative division of the People's Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county in China's administrative structure. Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief (Chinese: 司长) of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefectural level cities.","image":"China_Prefectural-level_cities.png.webp"}
