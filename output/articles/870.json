{"title":"4chan","summary":"4chan is an anonymous English-language imageboard website. Launched by Christopher \"moot\" Poole in October 2003, the site hosts boards dedicated to a wide variety of topics, from anime and manga to video games, music, literature, fitness, politics, and sports, among others. Registration is not available and users typically post anonymously; posting is ephemeral, as threads receiving recent replies are \"bumped\" to the top of their respective board and old threads are deleted as new ones are created. As of May 2021, 4chan receives more than 20 million unique monthly visitors, with more than 900,000 posts made daily.[2]","image":"4chan_logo.png.webp"}
