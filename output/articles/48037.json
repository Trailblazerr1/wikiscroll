{"title":"Water tower","summary":"A water tower is an elevated building supporting a water tank constructed at a height sufficient to pressurize a distribution system for potable water, and to provide emergency storage for fire protection.[1] Water towers often operate in conjunction with underground or surface service reservoirs, which store treated water close to where it will be used.[2] Other types of water towers may only store raw (non-potable) water for fire protection or industrial purposes, and may not necessarily be connected to a public water supply.","image":"Chateau_eau_mondeville_france.jpg.webp","url":"Water_tower"}
