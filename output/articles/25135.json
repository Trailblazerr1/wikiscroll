{"title":"Kurdistan Workers' Party","summary":"The Kurdistan Workers' Party or PKK (Kurmanji Kurdish: Partiya Karkerên Kurdistanê)[lower-alpha 1] is a Kurdish militant political organization and armed guerrilla movement, which historically operated throughout Greater Kurdistan, but is now primarily based in the mountainous Kurdish-majority regions of southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq. Since 1984, the PKK has utilized asymmetric warfare in the Kurdish–Turkish conflict (with ceasefires between 1999–2004 and 2013–2015). Although the PKK once sought an independent Kurdish state, in the 1990s its aims shifted toward autonomy and increased rights for Kurds within Turkey.","image":"Flag_of_Kurdistan_Workers'_Party.svg.png.webp"}
