{"title":"The Daily Stormer","summary":"The Daily Stormer is an American far-right, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, misogynist, and Holocaust denial commentary and message board website that advocates for a second genocide of Jews.[1][2][3][4][5] It considers itself a part of the alt-right movement.[6] Its editor, Andrew Anglin, founded it on July 4, 2013, as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website Total Fascism, which had focused on his own long-form essays on fascism, race, and antisemitic conspiracy theories. In contrast, The Daily Stormer relies heavily on quoted material with exaggerated headlines.[7]","image":"Daily_Stormer.png.webp","url":"The_Daily_Stormer"}
