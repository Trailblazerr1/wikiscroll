{"title":"Vector (molecular biology)","summary":"In molecular cloning, a vector is a DNA molecule used as a vehicle to artificially carry foreign genetic material into another cell, where it can be replicated and/or expressed (e.g., plasmid, cosmid, Lambda phages). A vector containing foreign DNA is termed recombinant DNA. The four major types of vectors are plasmids, viral vectors, cosmids, and artificial chromosomes.  Of these, the most commonly used vectors are plasmids.[1]  Common to all engineered vectors have an origin of replication, a multicloning site, and a selectable marker.","image":"PBR322_color.svg.png.webp","url":"Vector_(molecular_biology)"}
