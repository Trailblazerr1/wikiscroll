{"title":"Murder of Selena","summary":"Selena Quintanilla-Pérez was an American singer who achieved international fame as a member of Selena y Los Dinos and for her subsequent solo career in both Spanish and English.[nb 1]  Her father and manager, Abraham Quintanilla Jr, appointed Yolanda Saldívar president of Selena's fan club in 1991 after Saldívar had repeatedly asked permission to start one. In January 1994, Saldívar was promoted to manager of the singer's boutiques. Soon Selena's employees, fashion designer, and cousin began complaining about Saldívar's management style. In January 1995, Quintanilla Jr. began receiving telephone calls and letters from angry fans who had sent membership payments and had received nothing in return. He began investigating their complaints and found evidence that Saldívar had embezzled $60,000 from the fan club and the boutiques using forged checks. After the Quintanilla family confronted her about this, Saldívar fatally shot Selena with a .38 special revolver on the morning of March 31, 1995 at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi, Texas. Although the healthcare team tried to revive Selena, she was ultimately pronounced dead due to hypovolemic shock and cardiac arrest.","image":"Room_158.jpg.webp","url":"Murder_of_Selena"}
