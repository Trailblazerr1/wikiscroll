{"title":"Pin-up model","summary":"A pin-up model (known as a pin-up girl for a female and less commonly male pin-up for a male) is a model whose mass-produced pictures see widespread appeal as part of popular culture. Pin-up models were variously glamour models, fashion models, or actresses. Pin-ups are intended for informal display, i.e. meant to be \"pinned-up\" on a wall, which is the basis for the etymology of the phrase. These pictures are also sometimes known as cheesecake photos.[lower-alpha 1] Cheesecake was an American slang word that became a publicly acceptable term for scantily-clad, semi-nude, or nude photos of women because pin-up was considered taboo in the early 20th century.[1]","image":"Betty_Grable_20th_Century_Fox.jpg.webp","url":"Pin-up_model"}
