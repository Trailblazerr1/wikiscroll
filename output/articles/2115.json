{"title":"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis","summary":"Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), or acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, is a rare autoimmune disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. It is often triggered by a viral infection or (very rarely) vaccinations.[1][2][3][4][5][6]","image":"Fulminating_ADEM_showing_many_lesions.png.webp","url":"Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis"}
