{"title":"A&W Restaurants","summary":"A&W Restaurants is an American chain of fast-food restaurants distinguished by its burgers, draft root beer and root beer floats.[5][6] Its origins date back to 1919 when Roy W. Allen set up a roadside drink stand to offer a new thick and creamy drink, root beer, at a parade honoring returning World War I veterans in Lodi, California.[7][5] Allen's employee Frank Wright partnered with him in 1922 and they founded their first restaurant in Sacramento, California in 1923.[1] The company name was taken from the initials of their last names – Allen and Wright. The company became famous in the United States for its \"frosty mugs\" – the mugs were kept in a freezer and filled with A&W Root Beer just before being served to customers.","image":"All_American_Food_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"A&W_Restaurants"}
