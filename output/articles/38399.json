{"title":"Roman funerary practices","summary":"Roman funerary practices include the Ancient Romans' religious rituals concerning funerals, cremations, and burials. They were part of time-hallowed tradition (Latin: mos maiorum), the unwritten code from which Romans derived their social norms.[1] Elite funeral rites, especially processions and public eulogies, gave the family opportunity to publicly celebrate the life and deeds of the deceased, their ancestors, and the family's standing in the community. Sometimes the political elite gave costly public feasts, games and popular entertainments after family funerals, to honour the departed and to maintain a high public profile and reputation for generosity. The Roman gladiator games began as funeral gifts for the deceased in high status families.","image":"Bas_relief_from_Arch_of_Marcus_Aurelius_showing_sacrifice.jpg.webp"}
