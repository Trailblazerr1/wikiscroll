{"title":"Orbital elements","summary":"Orbital elements are the parameters required to uniquely identify a specific orbit. In celestial mechanics these elements are  considered in two-body systems using a Kepler orbit. There are many different ways to mathematically describe the same orbit, but certain schemes, each consisting of a set of six parameters, are commonly used in astronomy and orbital mechanics.","image":"Orbit1.svg.png.webp"}
