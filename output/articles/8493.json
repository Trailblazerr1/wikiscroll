{"title":"Capital market","summary":"A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt (over a year) or equity-backed securities are bought and sold,[1] in contrast to a money market where short-term debt is bought and sold. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments.[lower-alpha 1] Financial regulators like Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Bank of England (BoE) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversee capital markets to protect investors against fraud, among other duties.","image":"Capitalismlogo.svg.png.webp"}
