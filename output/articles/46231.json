{"title":"Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution","summary":"The Twenty-third Amendment (Amendment XXIII) to the United States Constitution extends the right to participate in presidential elections to the District of Columbia. The amendment grants the district electors in the Electoral College as though it were a state, though the district can never have more electors than the least-populous state.  The manner in which the electors are appointed is to be determined by Congress.  The Twenty-third Amendment was proposed by the 86th Congress on June 16, 1960; it was ratified by the requisite number of states on March 29, 1961.","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp","url":"Twenty-third_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"}
