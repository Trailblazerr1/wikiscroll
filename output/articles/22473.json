{"title":"Irradiance","summary":"In radiometry, irradiance is the radiant flux (power) received by a surface per unit area.  The SI unit of irradiance is the watt per square metre (W⋅m−2). The CGS unit erg per square centimetre per second (erg⋅cm−2⋅s−1) is often used in astronomy. Irradiance is often called intensity, but this term is avoided in radiometry where such usage leads to confusion with radiant intensity. In astrophysics, irradiance is called radiant flux.[1]","image":"a76d17f67ad47160f71360a135c890a95fdcb290.svg"}
