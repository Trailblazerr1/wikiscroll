{"title":"North magnetic pole","summary":"The north magnetic pole is a point on the surface of Earth's Northern Hemisphere at which the planet's magnetic field points vertically downward (in other words, if a magnetic compass needle is allowed to rotate in three dimensions, it will point straight down). There is only one location where this occurs, near (but distinct from) the geographic north pole.  The geomagnetic north pole, a related point, is the pole of an ideal dipole model of the Earth's magnetic field that most closely fits the Earth's actual magnetic field.","image":"North_Magnetic_Poles.svg.png.webp"}
