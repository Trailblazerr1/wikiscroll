{"title":"Nobility","summary":"Nobility is a social class  normally ranked immediately below royalty and found in some societies that have a formal aristocracy.  Nobility has often been an estate of the realm that possessed more acknowledged privilege and higher social status than most other classes in society.  The privileges associated with nobility may constitute substantial advantages over or relative to non-nobles or may be largely honorary (e.g., precedence), and vary by country and era. Membership in the nobility, including rights and responsibilities, is typically hereditary.","image":"House_of_Lords_Microcosm_edited.jpg.webp","url":"Nobility"}
