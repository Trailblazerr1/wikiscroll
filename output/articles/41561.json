{"title":"SpaceX Raptor","summary":"Raptor is a family of full-flow staged-combustion-cycle rocket engines developed and manufactured by SpaceX for use on the in-development SpaceX Starship. The engine is powered by \"methalox\" (cryogenic liquid methane and LOX) rather than the \"kerolox\" (RP-1 kerosene and LOX) used in SpaceX's prior Merlin and Kestrel rocket engines. The Raptor engine has more than twice the thrust of SpaceX's Merlin 1D engine that powers the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.","image":"SpaceX_sea-level_Raptor_at_Hawthorne_-_2.jpg.webp","url":"SpaceX_Raptor"}
