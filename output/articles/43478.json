{"title":"Tax credit","summary":"A tax credit is a tax incentive which allows certain taxpayers to subtract the amount of the credit they have accrued from the total they owe the state.[1] It may also be a credit granted in recognition of taxes already paid or a form of state \"discount\" applied in certain cases. Another way to think of a tax credit is as a rebate.","image":"10_Percent_Legacy_and_Succession_Duty_Impressed_Duty_Stamp.svg.png.webp","url":"Tax_credit"}
