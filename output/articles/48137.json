{"title":"Web server","summary":"A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP, the network protocol created to distribute web content, or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a specific resource using HTTP, and the web server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. The web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.[1]\n[2]","image":"Web_server_serving_static_content.png.webp"}
