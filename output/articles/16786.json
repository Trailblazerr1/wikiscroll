{"title":"Fraction","summary":"A fraction (from Latin fractus, \"broken\") represents a part of a whole or, more generally, any number of equal parts. When spoken in everyday English, a fraction describes how many parts of a certain size there are, for example, one-half, eight-fifths, three-quarters. A common, vulgar, or simple fraction (examples: 1 2 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {1}{2}}} and 17 3 {\\displaystyle {\\tfrac {17}{3}}} ) consists of a numerator displayed above a line (or before a slash like 1‚ÅÑ2), and a non-zero denominator, displayed below (or after) that line. Numerators and denominators are also used in fractions that are not common, including compound fractions, complex fractions, and mixed numerals.","image":"edef8290613648790a8ac1a95c2fb7c3972aea2f.svg","url":"Fraction"}
