A temple was constructed on the site between 60-70AD in the first few decades of Roman Britain. Its presence led to the development of the small Roman urban settlement known as Aquae Sulis around the site. The Roman baths—designed for public bathing—were used until the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 5th Century AD. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the original Roman baths were in ruins a century later. The area around the natural springs was  redeveloped several times during the Early and Late Middle Ages.","image":"Roman_Baths_in_Bath_Spa%2C_England_-_July_2006.jpg.webp","url":"Roman_Baths_(Bath)"}
