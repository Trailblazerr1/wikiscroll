{"title":"Princely state","summary":"A princely state, also called a native state, feudatory state or Indian state (for those states on the subcontinent), was a vassal state[1] under a local or indigenous or regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the East India Company and after 1858 with the British Crown. Though the history of the princely states of the subcontinent dates from at least the classical period of Indian history, the predominant usage of the term princely state specifically refers to a semi-sovereign principality on the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj that was not directly governed by the British, but rather by a local ruler, subject to a form of indirect rule on some matters. The imprecise doctrine of paramountcy allowed the government of British India to interfere in the internal affairs of princely states individually or collectively[2] and issue edicts that applied to all of India when it deemed it necessary.","image":"IndiaPolitical1893ConstablesHandAtlas.jpg.webp","url":"Princely_state"}
