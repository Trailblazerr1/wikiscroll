{"title":"Contour line","summary":"A contour line (also isoline, isopleth, or isarithm) of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value, so that the curve joins points of equal value.[1][2] It is a plane section of the three-dimensional graph of the function f ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle f(x,y)} parallel to the ( x , y ) {\\displaystyle (x,y)} -plane. More generally, a contour line for a function of two variables is a curve connecting points where the function has the same particular value.[2]","image":"29473ed0c4e838ac9dbe074535e507166c0e9101.svg","url":"Contour_line"}
