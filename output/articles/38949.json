{"title":"Sacagawea dollar","summary":"The Sacagawea dollar (also known as the \"golden dollar\") is a United States dollar coin introduced in 2000, although not minted for general circulation between 2002 to 2008 and again from 2012 onward because of its general unpopularity with the public and low business demand for the coin. These coins have a copper core clad by manganese brass, giving them a distinctive golden color.  The coin features an obverse by Glenna Goodacre.  From 2000 to 2008, the reverse featured an eagle design by Thomas D. Rogers. Since 2009, the reverse of the Sacagawea dollar has been changed yearly, with each design in the series depicting a different aspect of Native American cultures. These coins are marketed as \"Native American dollars\".","image":"Sacagawea_dollar_obverse.png.webp","url":"Sacagawea_dollar"}
