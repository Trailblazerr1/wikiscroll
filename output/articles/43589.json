{"title":"Teleost","summary":"Teleostei /tɛliːˈɒstiːaɪ/ (Greek: teleios \"complete\" + osteon \"bone\"), members of which are known as teleosts /ˈtɛliːɒsts/, is by far the largest infraclass in the class Actinopterygii, the ray-finned fishes,[lower-alpha 1] containing 96% of all extant species of fish. Teleosts are arranged into about 40 orders and 448 families. Over 26,000 species have been described. Teleosts range from giant oarfish measuring 7.6 m (25 ft) or more, and ocean sunfish weighing over 2 t (2.0 long tons; 2.2 short tons), to the minute male anglerfish Photocorynus spiniceps, just 6.2 mm (0.24 in) long. Including not only torpedo-shaped fish built for speed, teleosts can be flattened vertically or horizontally, be elongated cylinders or take specialised shapes as in anglerfish and seahorses.","image":"Teleostei_Examples.jpg.webp","url":"Teleost"}
