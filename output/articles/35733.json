{"title":"Poverty threshold","summary":"The poverty threshold, poverty limit, poverty line or breadline,[1] is the minimum level of income deemed adequate in a particular country.[2] The poverty line is usually calculated by finding the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year.[3] The largest of these expenses is typically the rent required for accommodation, so historically, economists have paid particular attention to the real estate market and housing prices as a strong poverty line affect.[4] Individual factors are often used to account for various circumstances, such as whether one is a parent, elderly, a child, married, etc. The poverty threshold may be adjusted annually. In practice, like the definition of poverty, the official or common understanding of the poverty line is significantly higher in developed countries than in developing countries.[5][6]","image":"Extreme_poverty_1981-2008.svg.png.webp","url":"Poverty_threshold"}
