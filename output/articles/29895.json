{"title":"Mike Jackson (British Army officer)","summary":"General Sir Michael David Jackson, GCB, CBE, DSO, DL (born 21 March 1944)[1][2] is a retired British Army officer and one of its most high-profile generals since the Second World War.[3] Originally commissioned into the Intelligence Corps in 1963, he transferred to the Parachute Regiment in 1970, with which he served two of his three tours of duty in Northern Ireland. On his first, he was present as an adjutant at the events of the Ballymurphy massacre (1971), where eleven unarmed innocent civilians were shot dead by British troops, and then at Bloody Sunday in 1972, when British soldiers opened fire on protesters, killing fourteen. On his second, he was a company commander in the aftermath of the Warrenpoint ambush (1979), the British Army's heaviest single loss of life during the Troubles. He was assigned to a staff post at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in 1982 before assuming command of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, in 1984. Jackson was posted to Northern Ireland for the third time, as a brigade commander, in the early 1990s.","image":"GeneralSirMikeJackson_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Mike_Jackson_(British_Army_officer)"}
