{"title":"List of FA Community Shield matches","summary":"The Football Association Community Shield (formerly the Charity Shield, up to and including the 2001 edition) is an annual association football match organised by the Football Association and presently contested between the champions of the Premier League and the winners of the FA Cup. In the event where a club achieves the domestic double, it will go on to face the league runners-up instead.[1] The match is played every August as the \"traditional curtain-raiser\" and first trophy of the new English domestic football season.[2][3] Since 1974, all but seven of the matches have been held at either the original or new Wembley stadiums.[upper-alpha 1] Stamford Bridge, which was where the inaugural Charity Shield was played in 1908, has hosted the second-most finals with 11.[6][7]","image":"FA_Community_Shield.JPG.webp","url":"List_of_FA_Community_Shield_matches"}
