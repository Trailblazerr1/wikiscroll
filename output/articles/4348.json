{"title":"Arginine","summary":"Arginine, also known as l-arginine (symbol Arg or R),[1] is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins.[2] It contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain consisting of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain ending in a guanidino group. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−COO−), the amino group is protonated (−NH3+), and the guanidino group is also protonated to give the guanidinium form (-C-(NH2)2+), making arginine a charged, aliphatic amino acid.[3] It is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG.","image":"Arginin_-_Arginine.svg.png.webp"}
