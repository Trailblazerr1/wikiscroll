{"title":"Mitral valve","summary":"The mitral valve (/ˈmaɪtrəl/), also known as the bicuspid valve or left atrioventricular valve, is one of the four heart valves. It has two cusps or flaps and lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle of the heart. The heart valves are all one-way valves allowing blood flow in just one direction. The mitral valve and the tricuspid valve are known as the atrioventricular valves because they lie between the atria and the ventricles.[1]","image":"Diagram_of_the_human_heart_(cropped).svg.png.webp","url":"Mitral_valve"}
