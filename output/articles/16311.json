{"title":"Fish farming","summary":"Fish farming or pisciculture involves commercial breeding of fish, usually for food, in fish tanks or artificial enclosures such as fish ponds.  It is a particular type of aquaculture, which is the controlled cultivation and harvesting of aquatic animals such as fish, crustaceans, molluscs and so on, in natural or pseudo-natural environment. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish hatchery.  Worldwide, the most important fish species produced in fish farming are carp, catfish, salmon and tilapia.[1]","image":"Loch_Ainort_fish_farm_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1800327.jpg.webp","url":"Fish_farming"}
