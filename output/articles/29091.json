{"title":"McMurdo Sound","summary":"McMurdo Sound is a sound in Antarctica. The sound, which extends about 55 kilometres (34 mi) long and wide, connects to the Ross Sea to the north, and to the Ross Ice Shelf cavity to the south via Haskell Strait. The strait is largely covered by the McMurdo Ice Shelf. The Royal Society Range rises from sea level to 4,205 metres (13,796 ft) on the western shoreline. Ross Island, an historic jumping-off point for polar explorers, designates the eastern boundary. The active volcano Mount Erebus at 3,794 metres (12,448 ft) dominates Ross Island. Antarctica's's largest scientific base, the United States' McMurdo Station, as well as the New Zealand Scott Base are on the southern shore of the island. Less than 10 percent of McMurdo Sound's shoreline is free of ice.[1] It is the southernmost navigable body of water in the world.[2]","image":"Mcmurdo_sound_USGS_map.jpg.webp"}
