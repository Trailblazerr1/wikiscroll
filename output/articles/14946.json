{"title":"Eosinophil","summary":"Eosinophils, sometimes called eosinophiles or, less commonly, acidophils, are a variety of white blood cells (WBCs) and one of the immune system components responsible for combating multicellular parasites and certain infections in vertebrates.[2] Along with mast cells and basophils, they also control mechanisms associated with allergy and asthma.  They are granulocytes that develop during hematopoiesis in the bone marrow before migrating into blood, after which they are terminally differentiated and do not multiply.[3] They form about 2 to 3% of WBCs.","image":"Blausen_0352_Eosinophil_(crop).png.webp","url":"Eosinophil"}
