{"title":"Orbit","summary":"In celestial mechanics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object,[1] such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajectory, although it may also refer to a non-repeating trajectory. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptic orbits, with the center of mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse,[2] as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.","image":"STS-130_Endeavour_flyaround_5.jpg.webp"}
