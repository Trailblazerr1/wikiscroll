{"title":"Origin of water on Earth","summary":"The origin of water on Earth is the subject of a body of research in the fields of planetary science, astronomy, and astrobiology. Earth is unique among the rocky planets in the Solar System in that it is the only planet known to have oceans of liquid water on its surface.[2] Liquid water, which is necessary for life as we know it, continues to exist on the surface of Earth because the planet is at a distance, known as the  habitable zone, far enough from the Sun that it does not lose its water to the runaway greenhouse effect, but not so far that low temperatures cause all water on the planet to freeze.","image":"BlueMarble-2001-2002.jpg.webp","url":"Origin_of_water_on_Earth"}
