{"title":"Login","summary":"In computer security, logging in (or logging on, signing in, or signing on) is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves. The user credentials are typically some form of username and a matching password,[1] and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as a login (or logon, sign-in, sign-on).[2][1] In practice, modern secure systems often require a second factor such as email or SMS confirmation for extra security.","image":"lossless-page1-220px-Log_in.tif.png.webp"}
