{"title":"2011 Bahraini uprising","summary":"The 2011 Bahraini uprising was a series of anti-government protests in Bahrain led by the Shia-dominant and some Sunni minority Bahraini opposition from 2011 until 2014. The protests were inspired by the unrest of the 2011 Arab Spring and 2011â€“12 Iranian protests and escalated to daily clashes after the Bahraini government repressed the revolt with the support of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Peninsula Shield Force.[27] The Bahraini protests were a series of demonstrations, amounting to a sustained campaign of non-violent civil disobedience[28] and some violent[29][30] resistance in the Persian Gulf country of Bahrain.[31] As part of the revolutionary wave of protests in the Middle East and North Africa following the self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, the Bahraini protests were initially aimed at achieving greater political freedom and equality for the 70% Shia population.[32][33]","image":"BahrainUprising.png.webp","url":"2011_Bahraini_uprising"}
