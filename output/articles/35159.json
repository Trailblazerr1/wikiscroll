{"title":"Planetary habitability","summary":"Planetary habitability is the measure of a planet's or a natural satellite's potential to develop and maintain environments hospitable to life.[1] Life may be generated directly on a planet or satellite endogenously or be transferred to it from another body, through a hypothetical process known as panspermia.[2] Environments do not need to contain life to be considered habitable nor are accepted habitable zones the only areas in which life might arise.[3]","image":"The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg.webp","url":"Planetary_habitability"}
