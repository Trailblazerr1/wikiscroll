{"title":"Umayyad dynasty","summary":"The Umayyad dynasty (Arabic: بَنُو أُمَيَّةَ‎, romanized: Banū Umayya, lit. 'Sons of Umayya') or Umayyads  (الأمويون) were the ruling family of the Muslim caliphate between 661 and 750 and later of Islamic Iberia in Europe between 756 and 1031. In the pre-Islamic period, they were a prominent clan of the Meccan tribe of Quraysh, descended from Umayya ibn Abd Shams. Despite staunch opposition to the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the Umayyads embraced Islam before the latter's death in 632. A member of the clan, Uthman, went on to become the third Rashidun caliph in 644–656, while other members held various governorships. One of these governors, Mu'awiya I, fought the First Muslim Civil War in 661 and established the Umayyad Caliphate with its capital in Damascus, Syria. This marked the beginning of the Umayyad dynasty, the first hereditary dynasty in the history of Islam, and the only one to rule over the entire Islamic world of its time.","image":"White_flag_3_to_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Umayyad_dynasty"}
