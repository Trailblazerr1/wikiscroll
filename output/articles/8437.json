{"title":"Cantilever","summary":"A cantilever is a rigid structural element that extends horizontally and is supported at only one end. Typically it extends from a flat vertical surface such as a wall, to which it must be firmly attached. Like other structural elements, a cantilever can be formed as a beam, plate, truss, or slab.","image":"Cantilever_examples.svg.png.webp","url":"Cantilever"}
