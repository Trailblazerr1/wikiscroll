{"title":"Navier–Stokes equations","summary":"In physics, the Navier–Stokes equations (/nævˈjeɪ stoʊks/) are certain partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances, named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and Anglo-Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842–1850 (Stokes).","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg"}
