{"title":"Baptism","summary":"Baptism (from the Greek noun βάπτισμα báptisma) is a Christian rite of admission and adoption,[1] almost invariably with the use of water, into Christianity.[2][3] It may be performed by sprinkling or pouring water on the head, or by immersing in water either partially or completely, traditionally three times for each person of the Trinity.[4][5][6] The synoptic gospels recount that John the Baptist baptised Jesus.[7][8][9][10] Baptism is considered a sacrament in most churches, and as an ordinance in others. Baptism according to the Trinitarian formula, which is done in most mainstream Christian denominations, is seen as being a basis for Christian ecumenism, the concept of unity amongst Christians.[11][12] Baptism is also called christening,[13][14] although some reserve the word \"christening\" for the baptism of infants.[15] In certain Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Churches, baptism is the door to church membership, with candidates taking baptismal vows.[16][17] It has also given its name to the Baptist churches and denominations.","image":"Battesimo_dei_neofiti_2.jpg.webp","url":"Baptism"}
