{"title":"Boson","summary":"In quantum mechanics, a boson (/ˈboʊsɒn/,[1] /ˈboʊzɒn/[2]) is a particle that follows Bose–Einstein statistics (integer spin). Bosons make up one of two classes of elementary particles, the other being fermions.[3] The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac[4][5] to commemorate the contribution of Satyendra Nath Bose, an Indian physicist and professor of physics at University of Calcutta and at University of Dhaka[6][7] in developing, with Albert Einstein, Bose–Einstein statistics, which theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles.[8]","image":"Bosons-Hadrons-Fermions-RGB.svg.png.webp","url":"Boson"}
