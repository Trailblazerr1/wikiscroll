{"title":"Partition coefficient","summary":"In the physical sciences, a partition coefficient (P) or distribution coefficient (D)  is the ratio of concentrations of a compound in a mixture of two immiscible solvents at equilibrium. This ratio is therefore a comparison of the solubilities of the solute in these two liquids.  The partition coefficient generally refers to the concentration ratio of un-ionized species of compound, whereas the distribution coefficient refers to the concentration ratio of all species of the compound (ionized plus un-ionized).[1]","image":"Separatory_funnel_with_oil_and_colored_water.jpg.webp","url":"Partition_coefficient"}
