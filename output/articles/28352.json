{"title":"Many-worlds interpretation","summary":"The many-worlds interpretation (MWI) is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that asserts that the universal wavefunction is objectively real, and that there is no wave function collapse.[2] This implies that all possible outcomes of quantum measurements are physically realized in some \"world\" or universe.[3] In contrast to some other interpretations, such as the Copenhagen interpretation, the evolution of reality as a whole in MWI is rigidly deterministic.[2]: 8–9  Many-worlds is also called the relative state formulation or the Everett interpretation, after physicist Hugh Everett, who first proposed it in 1957.[4][5] Bryce DeWitt popularized the formulation and named it many-worlds in the 1970s.[1][2][6][7]","image":"Schroedingers_cat_film.svg.png.webp","url":"Many-worlds_interpretation"}
