Deadly clashes such as Rabaa massacre continued for several days, with three particularly bloody incidents being described by officials as \"massacres\" perpetrated by security forces.[9][10] During the month of Ramadan (10 July – 7 August), prime minister Hazem al-Beblawy threatened[11] to disperse the ongoing Pro-Morsi sit-ins in Rabaa al-Adaweya square and al-Nahda square.[12] The government crackdown of these protests occurred in a violent dispersal on 14 August 2013.[13] In mid-August, the violence directed by the army towards the protesters escalated, with hundreds killed, and the government declaring a month-long nighttime curfew.[14]","image":"R4bia_sign_used_in_solidarity_with_victims_of_Rabaa_crackdown_23-Aug-2013.jpg.webp","url":"Post-coup_unrest_in_Egypt_(2013–2014)"}
