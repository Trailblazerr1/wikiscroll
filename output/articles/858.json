{"title":"42nd Street Shuttle","summary":"The 42nd Street Shuttle[2] is a New York City Subway shuttle train service that operates in Manhattan. The shuttle is sometimes referred to as the Grand Central/Times Square Shuttle, since these are the only two stations it serves. The shuttle runs at all times except late nights, with trains running on two tracks underneath 42nd Street between Times Square and Grand Central; for many decades, three tracks had been in service until a major renovation was begun in 2019 reducing it to two tracks. With two stations, it is the shortest regular service in the system by number of stops, running about 2,402 feet (732Â m) in 90 seconds as of 2005.[3] The shuttle is used by over 100,000 passengers every day, and by up to 10,200 passengers per hour during rush hours.[4]","image":"NYCS-bull-trans-S-Std.svg.png.webp","url":"42nd_Street_Shuttle"}
