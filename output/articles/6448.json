{"title":"Biblical and Quranic narratives","summary":"The Quran, the central religious text of Islam, contains references to more than fifty people and events also found in the Bible. While the stories told in each book are generally comparable, there are also some notable differences. Knowing that versions written in the Hebrew Bible and the Christian New Testament predate the Qur'ﾄ］'s versions, Christians reason the Qurﾄ］'s versions as being derived directly or indirectly from the earlier materials. Muslims understand the Qur'ﾄ］'s versions to be knowledge from an omnipotent God. As such, Muslims generally believe that the earlier versions are distorted through flawed processes of transmission and interpretation over time, and consider the Qur'ﾄ］'s version to be more accurate.","image":"Quran2.png.webp","url":"Biblical_and_Quranic_narratives"}
