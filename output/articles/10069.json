{"title":"Circus (Britney Spears album)","summary":"Circus is the sixth studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on November 28, 2008, by Jive Records. Looking to transition from her \"darker and more urban\" fifth studio album Blackout (2007), Spears wanted to make her next project \"a little bit lighter\". She recorded the album during the summer of 2008, after her much-publicized personal struggles saw her placement under a conservatorship earlier that year.","image":"Circus-_Album.png.webp"}
