{"title":"Amyloid","summary":"Amyloids are aggregates of proteins characterised by a fibrillar morphology of 7–13 nm in diameter, a β-sheet secondary structure (known as cross-β) and ability to be stained by particular dyes, such as Congo red.[1] In the human body, amyloids have been linked to the development of various diseases.[2] Pathogenic amyloids form when previously healthy proteins lose their normal structure and physiological functions (misfolding) and form fibrous deposits in plaques around cells which can disrupt the healthy function of tissues and organs.","image":"Small_bowel_duodenum_with_amyloid_deposition_20X.jpg.webp","url":"Amyloid"}
