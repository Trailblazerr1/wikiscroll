{"title":"Hachimoji DNA","summary":"Hachimoji DNA (from Japanese 八文字 hachimoji, \"eight letters\") is a synthetic nucleic acid analog that uses four synthetic nucleotides in addition to the four present in the natural nucleic acids, DNA and RNA.  This leads to four allowed base pairs: two unnatural base pairs formed by the synthetic nucleobases in addition to the two normal pairs.  Hachimoji bases have been demonstrated in both DNA and RNA analogs, using deoxyribose and ribose respectively as the backbone sugar.[1][2][3][4][5]","image":"DNA_animation.gif"}
