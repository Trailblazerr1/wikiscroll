{"title":"Btrfs","summary":"Btrfs (pronounced as \"better F S\",[8] \"butter F S\",[11][12] \"b-tree F S\",[12] or simply by spelling it out) is a computer storage format that combines a file system based on the copy-on-write (COW) principle with a logical volume manager (not to be confused with Linux's LVM), developed together. It was initially designed at Oracle Corporation in 2007 for use in Linux, and since November 2013, the file system's on-disk format has been declared stable in the Linux kernel.[13] According to Oracle, Btrfs \"is not a true acronym\".[14]","image":"Btrfs_filesystem_usage_screenshot.png.webp","url":"Btrfs"}
