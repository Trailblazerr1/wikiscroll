{"title":"Gilles Deleuze","summary":"Gilles Deleuze (/dəˈluːz/; French: [ʒil dəløz]; 18 January 1925 – 4 November 1995) was a French philosopher who, from the early 1950s until his death in 1995, wrote on philosophy, literature, film, and fine art. His most popular works were the two volumes of Capitalism and Schizophrenia: Anti-Oedipus (1972) and A Thousand Plateaus (1980), both co-written with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari.  His metaphysical treatise Difference and Repetition (1968) is considered by many scholars to be his magnum opus.[1] An important part of Deleuze's oeuvre is devoted to the reading of other philosophers: the Stoics, Leibniz, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, and Bergson, with particular influence derived from Spinoza.[14] A. W. Moore, citing Bernard Williams's criteria for a great thinker, ranks Deleuze among the \"greatest philosophers\".[15] Although he once characterized himself as a \"pure metaphysician\",[16] his work has influenced a variety of disciplines across the humanities, including philosophy, art, and literary theory, as well as movements such as post-structuralism and postmodernism.[17]","image":"Gilles_Deleuze.png.webp","url":"Gilles_Deleuze"}
