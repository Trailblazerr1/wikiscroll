{"title":"Polish–Lithuanian War","summary":"The Polish–Lithuanian War was a conflict between the newly independent Lithuania and Poland in the aftermath of World War I. The conflict was fought primarily in the Vilnius and Suvalkai Region. The conflict was connected to the Polish–Soviet War and was subject to international mediation at the Conference of Ambassadors, later the League of Nations. The war is viewed differently by the respective sides, with Lithuanian historians considering the war as part of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, spanning from spring 1919 to November 1920 and the Polish historians deeming the war as part of the Polish-Soviet War and happening only in September–October 1920.","image":"Sejny_Parada.jpg.webp"}
