{"title":"Short circuit","summary":"A short circuit (sometimes abbreviated to short or s/c) is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low electrical impedance. This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit. The opposite of a short circuit is an \"open circuit\", which is an infinite resistance between two nodes.","image":"Crossed_wires.JPG.webp","url":"Short_circuit"}
