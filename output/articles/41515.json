{"title":"Southern California","summary":"Southern California (popularly known as SoCal; Spanish: Sur de California) is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises the southern portion of the U.S. state of California. It includes the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the second most populous urban agglomeration in the United States.[3][4] The region generally contains ten of California's 58 counties: Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties. The Colorado Desert and the Colorado River are located on southern California's eastern border with Arizona, and San Bernardino County shares a border with Nevada to the northeast. Southern California's southern border with Baja California is part of the Mexicoâ€“United States border. Over time, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining the region's water security.[5][6][7]","image":"San_Diego_panoramic_skyline_at_night.jpg.webp"}
