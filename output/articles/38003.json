{"title":"Rings of Jupiter","summary":"The planet Jupiter has a system of faint planetary rings. The Jovian rings were the third ring system to be discovered in the Solar System, after those of Saturn and Uranus. The main ring was discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 space probe[1] and the system was more thoroughly investigated in the 1990s by the Galileo orbiter.[2] The main ring has also been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and from Earth for several years.[3] Ground-based observation of the rings requires the largest available telescopes.[4]","image":"PIA01627_Ringe.jpg.webp","url":"Rings_of_Jupiter"}
