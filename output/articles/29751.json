{"title":"Mickey Rooney","summary":"Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr. (September 23, 1920 â€“ April 6, 2014), best known as Mickey Rooney, was an American actor, producer, radio entertainer and vaudevillian. In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until his death, he appeared in more than 300 films, and was among the last surviving stars of the silent-film era.[1] He was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941,[2] and one of the best-paid actors of that era.[3] At the height of a career marked by declines and comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized mainstream America's self-image.","image":"Mickey_Rooney_still.jpg.webp"}
