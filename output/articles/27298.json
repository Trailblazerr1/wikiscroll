{"title":"Long-term potentiation","summary":"In neuroscience, long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons.[2] The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.","image":"LTP_exemplar.jpg.webp","url":"Long-term_potentiation"}
