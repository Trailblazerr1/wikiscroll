{"title":"SMS Von der Tann","summary":"SMS Von der Tann[lower-alpha 1] was the first battlecruiser built for the German Kaiserliche Marine, as well as Germany's first major turbine-powered warship. At the time of her construction, Von der Tann was the fastest dreadnought-type warship afloat, capable of reaching speeds in excess of 27 knots (50 km/h; 31 mph). She was designed in response to the British  Invincible class. While the German design had slightly lighter guns—28 cm (11 in),[lower-alpha 2] compared to the 30.5 cm (12 in) Mark X mounted on the British ships—Von der Tann was faster and significantly better-armored. She set the precedent of German battlecruisers carrying much heavier armor than their British equivalents, albeit at the cost of smaller guns.","image":"SMS_von_der_Tann_LOC_16927u.jpg.webp","url":"SMS_Von_der_Tann"}
