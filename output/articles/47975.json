{"title":"Wasabi","summary":"Wasabi (Japanese: ワサビ, わさび, or 山葵, pronounced [ɰaꜜsabi]; Eutrema japonicum or Wasabia japonica)[1] or Japanese horseradish[2] is a plant of the family Brassicaceae, which also includes horseradish and mustard in other genera. A paste made from its ground rhizomes is used as a pungent condiment for sushi and other foods. It is similar in taste to hot mustard or horseradish rather than chili peppers in that it stimulates the nose more than the tongue. Most wasabi flavoring in commerce is, however, ersatz, based on horseradish and food coloring.","image":"Wasabia_japonica_4.JPG.webp"}
