{"title":"At-will employment","summary":"In United States labor law, at-will employment is an employer's ability to dismiss an employee for any reason (that is, without having to establish \"just cause\" for termination), and without warning,[1] as long as the reason is not illegal (e.g. firing because of the employee's race, religion or sexuality). When an employee is acknowledged as being hired \"at will,\" courts deny the employee any claim for loss resulting from the dismissal. The rule is justified by its proponents on the basis that an employee may be similarly entitled to leave their job without reason or warning.[2] The practice is seen as unjust by those who view the employment relationship as characterized by inequality of bargaining power.[3]","image":"At-will_employment_-_public_policy_exceptions.svg.png.webp","url":"At-will_employment"}
