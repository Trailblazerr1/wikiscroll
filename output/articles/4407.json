{"title":"Armenian Revolutionary Federation","summary":"The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Armenian: Հայ Յեղափոխական Դաշնակցութիւն, ՀՅԴ (classical spelling)[lower-alpha 1], abbr. ARF or ARF-D) also known as Dashnaktsutyun[lower-alpha 2] (collectively referred to as Dashnaks for short), is an Armenian nationalist and socialist political party[26][27][28][29] founded in 1890 in Tiflis, Russian Empire (now Tbilisi, Georgia) by Christapor Mikaelian, Stepan Zorian, and Simon Zavarian.[30] Today the party operates in Armenia, Artsakh, Lebanon, Iran and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is present. Although it has long been the most influential political party in the Armenian diaspora, it has a comparatively smaller presence in modern-day Armenia.[31] As of October 2021, the party was represented in three national parliaments with ten seats in the National Assembly of Armenia, three seats in the National Assembly of Artsakh and three seats in the Parliament of Lebanon[32][33] as part of the March 8 Alliance.","image":"Armenian_Revolutionary_Federation_logo.png.webp"}
