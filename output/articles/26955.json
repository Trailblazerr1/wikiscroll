{"title":"List of popes","summary":"This chronological list of popes corresponds to that given in the Annuario Pontificio under the heading \"I Sommi Pontefici Romani\" (The Supreme Pontiffs of Rome), excluding those that are explicitly indicated as antipopes. Published every year by the Roman Curia, the Annuario Pontificio no longer identifies popes by regnal number, stating that it is impossible to decide which pope represented the legitimate succession at various times.[1] The 2001 edition of the Annuario Pontificio introduced \"almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II\". The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope.[2]","image":"Tafel_paepste.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_popes"}
