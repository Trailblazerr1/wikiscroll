{"title":"Sclerophyll","summary":"Sclerophyll is a type of vegetation that has hard leaves, short internodes (the distance between leaves along the stem) and leaf orientation parallel or oblique to direct sunlight that are adapted to long periods of dryness and heat that some types of vegetation present. The word comes from the Greek sklÄ“ros (hard) and phyllon (leaf). The term was coined by A.F.W. Schimper in 1898 (translated in 1903), originally as a synonym of xeromorph, but later was changed.[1]","image":"Arroyo_pescadero_03.JPG.webp"}
