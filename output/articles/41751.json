{"title":"Spinning (textiles)","summary":"Spinning is a twisting technique to form yarn from fibers. The fiber intended is drawn out, twisted, and wound onto a bobbin. Originally done by hand using a spindle whorl, the spinning wheel became across Asia and Europe. The spinning jenny and spinning mule, invented in the late 1700s, made mechanical spinning far more efficient than spinning by hand, and made cotton manufacturing one of the centers of the Industrial Revolution.","image":"An_ancient_tradition.jpg.webp"}
