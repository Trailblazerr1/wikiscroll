{"title":"Law clerk","summary":"A law clerk or a judicial clerk is an individual—generally an attorney—who provides direct assistance and counsel to a judge in making legal determinations and in writing opinions by researching issues before the court. Judicial clerks often play significant roles in the formation of case law through their influence upon judges' decisions.[1][2] Judicial clerks should not be confused with legal clerks (also called \"law clerks\" in Canada), court clerks, or courtroom deputies who provide secretarial and administrative support to attorneys and/or judges.","image":"Flickr_-_Government_Press_Office_(GPO)_-_THE_SUPREME_COURT_JUSTICES_AND_THEIR_LAW_CLERKS.jpg.webp","url":"Law_clerk"}
