{"title":"Robert Moses","summary":"Robert Moses (December 18, 1888 â€“ July 29, 1981) was an American public official who worked mainly in the New York metropolitan area. Known as the \"master builder\" of mid-20th century New York City, Long Island, and Rockland and Westchester counties, he is sometimes compared to Baron Haussmann of Second Empire Paris, and was one of the most polarizing figures in the history of United States urban development. His decisions favoring highways over public transit helped create the modern suburbs of Long Island. Although he was not a trained civil engineer,[lower-alpha 1] Moses's programs and designs influenced a generation of engineers, architects, and urban planners nationwide.[4]","image":"Robert_Moses_with_Battery_Bridge_model.jpg.webp"}
