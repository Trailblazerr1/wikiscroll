{"title":"Europa (consort of Zeus)","summary":"In Greek mythology, Europa (/jʊəˈroʊpə, jə-/; Ancient Greek: Εὐρώπη, Eurṓpē, Attic Greek pronunciation: [eu̯.rɔ̌ː.pɛː]) was a Phoenician princess of Argive Greek origin, and the mother of King Minos of Crete. The continent of Europe is named after her. The story of her abduction by Zeus in the form of a bull was a Cretan story; as classicist Károly Kerényi points out, \"most of the love-stories concerning Zeus originated from more ancient tales describing his marriages with goddesses. This can especially be said of the story of Europa.\"[1]","image":"Wall_painting_-_Europa_and_the_bull_-_Pompeii_(IX_5_18-21)_-_Napoli_MAN_111475_-_02.jpg.webp","url":"Europa_(consort_of_Zeus)"}
