{"title":"Japanese battleship Musashi","summary":"Musashi (武蔵), named after the former Japanese province,[2] was one of three  Yamato-class battleships[N 1] built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN), beginning in the late 1930s. The Yamato-class ships were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed,[4] displacing almost 72,000 long tons (73,000 t) fully loaded and armed with nine 46-centimetre (18.1 in) main guns. Their secondary armament consisted of four 15.5-centimetre (6.1 in) triple-gun turrets formerly used by the  Mogami-class cruisers. They were equipped with six or seven floatplanes to conduct reconnaissance.","image":"Japanese_battleship_Musashi_underway_in_1944_(NH_63473).jpg.webp"}
