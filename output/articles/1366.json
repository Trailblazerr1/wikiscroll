{"title":"Mount Etna","summary":"Mount Etna, or simply Etna (Italian: Etna [ˈɛtna] or Mongibello [mondʒiˈbɛllo]; Sicilian: Muncibbeḍḍu [mʊntʃɪbˈbɛɖɖʊ] or 'a Muntagna; Latin: Aetna; Ancient Greek: Αἴτνα and Αἴτνη[4]), is an active stratovolcano on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, in the Metropolitan City of Catania, between the cities of Messina and Catania. It lies above the convergent plate margin between the African Plate and the Eurasian Plate. It is one of the tallest active volcanoes in Europe,[5] and the tallest peak in Italy south of the Alps with a current height (July 2021) of 3,357 m (11,014 ft),[6] though this varies with summit eruptions. Satellite images reveal that Mount Etna has erupted so much in 2021 that it has grown about 100 feet (30 meters) in height in just six months time, and the southeastern crater is now the tallest part of the volcano.[7]","image":"Mt_Etna_and_Catania1.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fMount_Etna"}
