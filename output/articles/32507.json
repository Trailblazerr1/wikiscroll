{"title":"Nuclear meltdown","summary":"A nuclear meltdown (core meltdown, core melt accident, meltdown or partial core melt[2]) is a severe nuclear reactor accident that results in core damage from overheating. The term nuclear meltdown is not officially defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency[3] or by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.[4] It has been defined to mean the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor,[5] however, and is in common usage a reference to the core's either complete or partial collapse.","image":"LWR_Meltdown.gif","url":"Nuclear_meltdown"}
