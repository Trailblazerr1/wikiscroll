{"title":"Ecological footprint","summary":"The ecological footprint is a method promoted by the Global Footprint Network to  measure human demand on natural capital, i.e. the quantity of nature it takes to support people or an economy.[2][3][4] It tracks this demand through an ecological accounting system. The accounts contrast the biologically productive area people use for their consumption to the biologically productive area available within a region or the world (biocapacity, the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature). In short, it is a measure of human impact on the environment.","image":"World_map_of_countries_by_ecological_footprint_(2007).svg.png.webp"}
