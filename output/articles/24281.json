{"title":"Kaiser-class battleship","summary":"The Kaiser class was a class of five dreadnought battleships that were built in Germany prior to World War I and served in the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) during the war. They were the third class of German dreadnoughts, and the first to feature turbine engines and superfiring turrets. The five ships were Kaiser, Friedrich der Grosse, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and König Albert. As was usual for German battleships of the period, the Kaiser class mounted main guns that were smaller than those of their British rivals: 30.5 cm (12 in), compared to the 34.3 cm (13.5 in) guns of the British  Orion class.[1]","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-61-83%2C_Linienschiff_\"SMS_Kaiser\".jpg.webp","url":"Kaiser-class_battleship"}
