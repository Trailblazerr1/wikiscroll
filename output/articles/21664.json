{"title":"Imitation","summary":"Imitation (from Latin imitatio, \"a copying, imitation\"[1]) is a behavior whereby an individual observes and replicates another's behavior. Imitation is also a form of social learning that leads to the \"development of traditions, and ultimately our culture. It allows for the transfer of information (behaviours, customs, etc.) between individuals and down generations without the need for genetic inheritance.\"[2] The word imitation can be applied in many contexts, ranging from animal training to politics.[3] The term generally refers to conscious behavior; subconscious imitation is termed mirroring.[4]","image":"Walter_and_Seth_Singleton.jpg.webp","url":"Imitation"}
