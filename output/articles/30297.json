{"title":"Molecular symmetry","summary":"Molecular symmetry in chemistry describes the symmetry present in molecules and the classification of these molecules according to their symmetry.  Molecular symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry, as it can be used to predict or explain many of a molecule's chemical properties, such as its dipole moment and its allowed spectroscopic transitions. To do this it is necessary to classify the states of the molecule using the irreducible representations from the character table of the symmetry group of the molecule.  Many university level textbooks on physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, spectroscopy and inorganic chemistry devote a chapter to symmetry.[1][2][3][4][5][6]","image":"Formaldehyde_symmetry_elements.svg.png.webp","url":"Molecular_symmetry"}
