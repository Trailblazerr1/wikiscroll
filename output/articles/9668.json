{"title":"China–United States trade war","summary":"The China–United States trade war (Chinese: 中美贸易战; pinyin: Zhōngměi Màoyìzhàn) is an ongoing economic conflict between China and the United States. In January 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are \"unfair trade practices\" and intellectual property theft.[1] The Trump administration stated that these practices may contribute to the U.S.–China trade deficit, and that  the Chinese government requires transfer of American technology to China.[2] In response to US trade measures, the Chinese government accused the Trump administration of engaging in nationalist protectionism and took retaliatory action.[3][4] After the trade war escalated through 2019, on January 15, 2020, the two sides reached a phase one agreement, however tensions continued to persist. By the end of the Trump presidency, the trade war was widely characterized as a failure.[5]","image":"Signing_Ceremony_Phase_One_Trade_Deal_Between_the_U.S._%26_China_(49391434906).jpg.webp","url":"China–United_States_trade_war"}
