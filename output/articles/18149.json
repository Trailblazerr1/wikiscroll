{"title":"Giselle","summary":"Giselle (/dʒɪˈzɛl/;[1] French: [ʒizɛl]), originally titled Giselle, ou les Wilis (French: [ʒizɛl u le vili], 'Giselle, or The Wilis'), is a romantic ballet (\"ballet-pantomime\")[2] in two acts with music by Adolphe Adam. Considered a masterwork in the classical ballet performance canon, it was first performed by the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique at the Salle Le Peletier in Paris, France, on 28 June 1841, with Italian ballerina Carlotta Grisi as Giselle. The ballet was an unqualified triumph. Giselle became hugely popular and was staged at once across Europe, Russia, and the United States.","image":"Carlotta_Grisi_in_the_title_role_of_Giselle%2C_1842.jpg.webp"}
