{"title":"Centre-right politics","summary":"Centre-right politics (British English) or center-right politics (American English), also referred to as moderate-right politics, lean to the right of the political spectrum, but are closer to the centre than others. From the 1780s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the Western world of social class structure and the economy, moving away from the nobility and mercantilism, toward the upper class and capitalism.[1][2][3] This general economic shift toward capitalism affected centre-right movements, such as the Conservative Party of the United Kingdom, which responded by becoming supportive of capitalism.[4]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp"}
