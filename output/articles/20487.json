{"title":"History of Spain","summary":"The history of Spain dates to the Antiquity when the pre-Roman peoples of the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula made contact with the Greeks and Phoenicians and the first writing systems known as Paleohispanic scripts were developed. In 1479, the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, unified Spain as a dynastic union of disparate predecessor kingdoms (the Crown of Castile, the Crown of Aragon and smaller realms); its modern form of a constitutional monarchy was introduced in 1813, and the current democratic constitution dates to 1978. After the completion of the Reconquista, the Crown of Castile began to explore across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, expanding into the New World and marking the beginning of the Golden Age under the Spanish Empire. The kingdoms of Spain were brought in personal union under Habsburg rule in 1516. Until the 1650s, Habsburg Spain was the one of most powerful states in Europe and the world. The era of Bourbon Spain began in 1700. Spain continued to control a vast empire until the early 19th century.","image":"Atlas_Van_der_Hagen-KW1049B12_002-HISPANIAE_ET_PORTUGALIAE_REGNA.jpeg.webp"}
