{"title":"Herbivore","summary":"A herbivore is an animal anatomically and physiologically adapted to eating plant material, for example foliage or marine algae, for the main component of its diet. As a result of their plant diet, herbivorous animals typically have mouthparts adapted to rasping or grinding. Horses and other herbivores have wide flat teeth that are adapted to grinding grass, tree bark, and other tough plant material.","image":"White-tailed_deer_(Odocoileus_virginianus)_grazing_-_20050809.jpg.webp","url":"Herbivore"}
