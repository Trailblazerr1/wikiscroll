{"title":"Fear Factor","summary":"Fear Factor is an American stunt/dare game show that first aired on NBC from 2001 to 2006 and was initially hosted by comedian and UFC commentator Joe Rogan. The show was adapted from the original Dutch version Now or Neverland and renamed Fear Factor by Endemol USA and NBC for the American market. The show has spawned many spin-offs, creating the Fear Factor franchise. The show pits contestants against each other in a variety of three stunts for a grand prize, usually of $50,000. For the original series' first five seasons, the contestants consisted regularly of three men and three women who were competing for themselves. In the sixth season, the show's format was modified to feature four competing teams of two people who have a pre-existing relationship with one another. Fear Factor was cancelled by NBC in 2006 after six seasons and 144 episodes, briefly revived in 2011 for a nine-episode seventh season, cancelled for a second time in 2012 and revived for a third time in 2017 to air on MTV with rapper and actor Ludacris assuming the host role; the show ended in 2018 after two seasons on that network and only 33 episodes, bringing the overall episode total to 186 over two networks.","image":"Fear-factor-logo.jpg.webp"}
