{"title":"Livestreaming","summary":"Livestreaming is online streaming media simultaneously recorded and broadcast in real-time. It is often referred to simply as streaming, but this abbreviated term is ambiguous because \"streaming\" may refer to any media delivered and played back simultaneously without requiring a completely downloaded file. Non-live media such as video-on-demand, vlogs, and YouTube videos are technically streamed, but not live-streamed.","image":"Meyerskansolis_(1).jpg.webp"}
