{"title":"Mango","summary":"A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango cultivars: the \"Indian type\" and the \"Southeast Asian type\".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called \"mangoes\", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[4]","image":"Hapus_Mango.jpg.webp"}
