{"title":"Communist Party of the Philippines","summary":"The Communist Party of the Philippines (Filipino: Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas) is a far-left revolutionary organization and communist party in the Philippines, formed by Jose Maria Sison  on 26 December 1968. It is designated as a terrorist group by the United States Department of State[2][3] through Executive Order No. 13224 together with Sison and the New People's Army (NPA)[4] in 2002. The European Union,[5] through Council Decision (CSFP) 2019/1341, renewed the terrorist designation of the CPP-NPA in 2019,[6] though the European Union's second highest court ruled in September 2009 to delist Sison as a \"person supporting terrorism\" and reversed a decision by member governments to freeze assets.[7] According to the US' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) World Factbook, the CPP and its armed wing, the NPA, aims to destabilize the Philippines' economy and  overthrow the national government.[8]","image":"Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines_Hammer_and_Sickle.svg.png.webp","url":"Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines"}
