{"title":"Charles II of Spain","summary":"Charles II of Spain (Spanish: Carlos II) (6 November 1661 â€“ 1 November 1700),[1] known as the Bewitched (Spanish: El Hechizado), was the last Habsburg ruler of the Spanish Empire. Best remembered for his physical disabilities and the War of the Spanish Succession that followed his death, Charles' reign has traditionally been viewed as one of managed decline. However, many of the issues Spain faced in this period were inherited from his predecessors and some recent historians have suggested a more balanced perspective.[2]","image":"Juan_de_Miranda_Carreno_002.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_II_of_Spain"}
