{"title":"List of songs recorded by Katy Perry","summary":"American singer Katy Perry has recorded songs for six studio albums. After singing at church during her childhood, she decided to pursue a career in music in her teenage years.[1] She signed a record deal with Red Hill Records, and released a gospel album called Katy Hudson in 2001.[1] She wrote its songs \"Last Call\", \"My Own Monster\", \"Spit\", and \"When There's Nothing Left\" by herself while co-writing the remaining six with Mark Dickson, Scott Faircloff, Tommy Collier, and Brian White.[2] The album was unsuccessful and it failed to garner any attention. Red Hill Records shut down later that year.[1] Following two unsuccessful contracts with Island Def Jam Records and Columbia Records, whereby Perry was dropped by both them before she could finish an album, she ultimately secured a deal with Capitol Records in 2007, a division of record label Virgin.[1][3]","image":"Katy_Perry_at_Madison_Square_Garden_(37436598972).jpg.webp","url":"List_of_songs_recorded_by_Katy_Perry"}
