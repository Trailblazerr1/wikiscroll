{"title":"Lithography","summary":"Lithography (from Ancient Greek  λίθος, lithos 'stone', and  γράφειν, graphein 'to write')[1] is a method of printing originally based on the immiscibility of oil and water.[2] The printing is from a stone (lithographic limestone) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by the German author and actor Alois Senefelder and was initially used mostly for musical scores and maps.[3][4] Lithography can be used to print text or images onto paper or other suitable material.[5]  A lithograph is something printed by lithography, but this term is only used for fine art prints and some other, mostly older, types of printed matter, not for those made by modern commercial lithography.","image":"Charles_Marion_Russell_-_The_Custer_Fight_(1903).jpg.webp"}
