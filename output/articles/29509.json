{"title":"Meteor Crater","summary":"Meteor Crater, or  Barringer Crater,[2][3][4][5][6] is a meteorite impact crater about 37 mi (60 km)  east of Flagstaff and 18 mi (29 km) west of Winslow in the desert of northern Arizona,  United States. The site had several earlier names, and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite, after the adjacent Cañon Diablo.[7] Because the United States Board on Geographic Names recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of \"Meteor Crater\" from the nearby post office named Meteor.[8]","image":"Meteor_Crater_-_Arizona.jpg.webp"}
