{"title":"Logistic map","summary":"The logistic map is a polynomial mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) of degree 2, often cited as an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The map was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May,[1] in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation written down by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst.[2] Mathematically, the logistic map is written","image":"ed93f3cd8504352c79c6fc9206e1e9bfac0e3c37.svg","url":"Logistic_map"}
