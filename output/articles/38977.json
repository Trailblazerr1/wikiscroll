{"title":"Safavid dynasty","summary":"The Safavid dynasty (/ˈsæfəvɪd, ˈsɑː-/; Persian: دودمان صفوی‎, romanized: Dudmâne Safavi,[1] pronounced [d̪uːd̪ˈmɒːne sæfæˈviː]) was one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Iran from 1501 to 1736.[2] The Safavid dynasty had its origin in the Safavid order of Sufism, which was established in the city of Ardabil in the Iranian Azerbaijan region.[3] It was an Iranian dynasty of Kurdish origin,[4] but during their rule they intermarried with Turkoman,[5] Georgian,[6] Circassian,[7][8] and Pontic Greek[9] dignitaries. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over parts of Greater Iran and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region,[10] thus becoming the first native dynasty since the Sasanian Empire to establish a national state officially known as Iran.[11]","image":"Safavid_Flag.svg.png.webp"}
