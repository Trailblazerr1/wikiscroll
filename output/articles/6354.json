{"title":"beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid","summary":"β-Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid[note 1] (HMB), otherwise known as its conjugate base, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, is a naturally produced substance in humans that is used as a dietary supplement and as an ingredient in certain medical foods that are intended to promote wound healing and provide nutritional support for people with muscle wasting due to cancer or HIV/AIDS.[sources 1] In healthy adults, supplementation with HMB has been shown to increase exercise-induced gains in muscle size, muscle strength, and lean body mass, reduce skeletal muscle damage from exercise, improve aerobic exercise performance, and expedite recovery from exercise.[sources 2] Medical reviews and meta-analyses indicate that HMB supplementation also helps to preserve or increase lean body mass and muscle strength in individuals experiencing age-related muscle loss.[note 2][11][12][13] HMB produces these effects in part by stimulating the production of proteins and inhibiting the breakdown of proteins in muscle tissue.[11][14][15] No adverse effects from long-term use as a dietary supplement in adults have been found.[16][17][18]","image":"Beta-Hydroxy_beta-methylbutyric_acid_2.svg.png.webp"}
