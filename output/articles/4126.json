{"title":"Appeal","summary":"In law, an appeal is the process in which cases are reviewed by a higher authority, where parties request a formal change to an official decision. Appeals function both as a process for error correction as well as a process of clarifying and interpreting law.[1] Although appellate courts have existed for thousands of years, common law countries did not incorporate an affirmative right to appeal into their jurisprudence until the 19th century.[2]","image":"High_Court_of_Karnataka%2C_Bangalore_MMK.jpg.webp","url":"Appeal"}
