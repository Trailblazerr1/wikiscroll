{"title":"Crown Fountain","summary":"Crown Fountain is an interactive work of public art  and video sculpture featured in Chicago's Millennium Park, which is located in the Loop community area. Designed by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa and executed by Krueck and Sexton Architects, it opened in July 2004.[1][2] The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers. The towers are 50 feet (15.2 m) tall,[1] and they use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display digital videos on their inward faces.  Construction and design of the Crown Fountain cost $17 million.[3]  The water operates from May to October,[4] intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower's front face.","image":"Crown_Fountain_spouting.jpg.webp","url":"Crown_Fountain"}
