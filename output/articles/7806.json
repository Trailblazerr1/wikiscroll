{"title":"Buddhas of Bamiyan","summary":"The Buddhas of Bamiyan were two 6th-century[3] monumental statues, Salsal and Shahmama (in the Hazaragi dialect of Dari Persian), which were carved into the side of a cliff in the Bamyan valley of central Afghanistan, 130 kilometres (81 mi) northwest of Kabul at an elevation of 2,500 metres (8,200 ft). Carbon dating of the structural components of the Buddhas has determined that the smaller 38 m (125 ft) \"Eastern Buddha\" was built around 570 AD, and the larger 55 m (180 ft) \"Western Buddha\" was built around 618 AD, which would date both to the time when the Hephthalites ruled the region.[4][2]","image":"Smaller_38_m_(125_ft)_\"Eastern\"_Buddha_of_Bamiyan%2C_built_between_544_to_595_CE.jpg.webp","url":"Buddhas_of_Bamiyan"}
