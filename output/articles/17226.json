{"title":"Future Science Fiction and Science Fiction Stories","summary":"Future Science Fiction and Science Fiction Stories were two American science fiction magazines that were published under various names between 1939 and 1943 and again from 1950 to 1960.  Both publications were edited by Charles Hornig for the first few issues; Robert W. Lowndes took over in late 1941 and remained editor until the end.  The initial launch of the magazines came as part of a boom in science fiction pulp magazine publishing at the end of the 1930s.  In 1941 the two magazines were combined into one, titled Future Fiction combined with Science Fiction, but in 1943 wartime paper shortages ended the magazine's run, as Louis Silberkleit, the publisher, decided to focus his resources on his mystery and western magazine titles.  In 1950, with the market improving again, Silberkleit relaunched Future Fiction, still in the pulp format.  In the mid-1950s he also relaunched Science Fiction, this time under the title Science Fiction Stories.  Silberkleit kept both magazines on very slim budgets throughout the 1950s.  In 1960 both titles ceased publication when their distributor suddenly dropped all of Silberkleit's titles.","image":"Science_Fiction_March_1939.jpg.webp","url":"Future_Science_Fiction_and_Science_Fiction_Stories"}
