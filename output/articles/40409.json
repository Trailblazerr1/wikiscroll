{"title":"Shesha","summary":"Shesha (Sanskrit: Sesa), also known as Sheshanaga (Sesanaga) or Adishesha (Adi Sesa), is the Nagaraja or King of all Nagas and one of the primal beings of creation. In the Puranas, Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of the God Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as Ananta Shesha, which translates as Endless-Shesha or Adishesha \"First Shesha\". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist.","image":"Ananta_Shesha.jpg.webp"}
