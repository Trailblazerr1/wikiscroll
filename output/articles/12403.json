{"title":"Decipherment of ancient Egyptian scripts","summary":"The writing systems used in ancient Egypt were deciphered in the early nineteenth century through the work of several European scholars, especially Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion and Thomas Young. Ancient Egyptian forms of writing, which included the hieroglyphic, hieratic and demotic scripts, ceased to be understood in the fourth and fifth centuries AD, as the Coptic alphabet was increasingly used in their place. Later generations' knowledge of the older scripts was based on the work of Greek and Roman authors whose understanding was faulty. It was thus widely believed that Egyptian scripts were exclusively ideographic, representing ideas rather than sounds, and even that hieroglyphs were an esoteric, mystical script rather than a means of recording a spoken language. Some attempts at decipherment by Islamic and European scholars in the Middle Ages and early modern times acknowledged the script might have a phonetic component, but perception of hieroglyphs as purely ideographic hampered efforts to understand them as late as the eighteenth century.","image":"Portrait_de_Champollion_Le_Jeune_par_Madame_de_Rumilly_cropped.jpg.webp"}
