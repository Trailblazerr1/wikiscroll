{"title":"Majulah Singapura","summary":"Majulah Singapura[lower-alpha 1] is the national anthem of the Republic of Singapore. Composed by Zubir Said in 1958 as a theme song for official functions of the City Council of Singapore, the song was selected in 1959 as the island's anthem when it attained self-government. Upon full independence in 1965, Majulah Singapura was formally adopted as Singapore's national anthem. By law, the anthem must be sung with Malay lyrics, but there are authorised translations of the lyrics of the anthem in Singapore's three other official languages: English, Mandarin and Tamil.[1][2]","image":"Singapore_National_Anthem_at_the_National_Museum%2C_Singapore_-_20100720.jpg.webp","url":"Majulah_Singapura"}
