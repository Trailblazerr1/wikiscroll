{"title":"Hippolyta","summary":"In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta, or Hippolyte[1] (/hɪˈpɒlɪtə/; Greek: Ἱππολύτη Hippolyte) \"was a daughter of Ares and Otrera, queen of the Amazons, and a sister of Antiope and Melanippe. She wore her father Ares' zoster, the Greek word found in the Iliad and elsewhere meaning war belt.[2][3] Some traditional English translations have preferred the more feminine girdle.[1] Hippolyta figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. The myths about her are varied enough that they may therefore be about several different women.[4] The name Hippolyta comes from Greek roots meaning \"horse\" and \"let loose\".[5]","image":"Hippolyte.jpg.webp","url":"Hippolyta"}
