{"title":"Rococo","summary":"Rococo (/rəˈkoʊkoʊ/, also US: /ˌroʊkəˈkoʊ/), less commonly Roccoco or Late Baroque, is an exceptionally ornamental and theatrical style of architecture, art and decoration which combines asymmetry, scrolling curves, gilding, white and pastel colors, sculpted molding, and trompe-l'œil frescoes to create surprise and the illusion of motion and drama.  It is often described as the final expression of the Baroque movement.[1]","image":"Ca'_rezzonico%2C_salone_da_ballo%2C_quadrature_di_pietro_visconti_e_affreschi_di_g.b._crosato_(caduta_di_febo_e_4_continenti)%2C_1753%2C_02.jpg.webp","url":"Rococo"}
