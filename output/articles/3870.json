{"title":"Antebellum South","summary":"In the history of the Southern United States, the Antebellum Period (from Latin: ante bellum, lit.â€‰'before the war') spanned the end of the War of 1812 to the start of the American Civil War in 1861. The Antebellum South was characterized by the use of slavery and the culture it fostered. As the era proceeded, Southern intellectuals and leaders gradually shifted from defending slavery as an embarrassing and temporary system, to a full-on defense of slavery as a positive good, and harshly criticized the budding abolitionist movement.[2] As the country expanded westward, slavery's propagation became a major issue in national politics, eventually boiling over into the Civil War. In the years that followed, this period was romanticized by historical revisionists to protect three central, yet flawed, assertions: that the Confederate cause was heroic, that enslaved people were happy and satisfied, and that slavery was not the central cause of the war.[3] This phenomenon has continued to influence racism, gender roles and religious attitudes in the South, and to a lesser extent the rest of the country, to the present day.[4][5]","image":"Family_of_slaves_in_Georgia%2C_circa_1850.jpg.webp"}
