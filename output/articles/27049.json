{"title":"List of unreleased songs recorded by Michael Jackson","summary":"Michael Jackson was an American musician and entertainer. He is known to have written, recorded, and filmed material that has never been officially released. Many of his unreleased songs have been registered—usually by his company Mijac Music—with professional bodies such as the United States Copyright Office, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI), American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency (CMRRA) and EMI Music Publishing.[1] This list, however, only documents the songs explicitly cited as unreleased and therefore does not contain every unreleased Jackson song registered with such bodies.","image":"George_H._W._Bush_with_Michael_Jackson_(cropped).png.webp","url":"List_of_unreleased_songs_recorded_by_Michael_Jackson"}
