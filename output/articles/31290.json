{"title":"Nasi goreng","summary":"Nasi goreng (English pronunciation: /ˌnɑːsi ɡɒˈrɛŋ/) is a Southeast Asian fried rice dish, usually cooked with pieces of meat and vegetables. One of Indonesia's national dishes,[1][2] it is also endemic in Malay-speaking communities in countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and has gained popularity in Sri Lanka through migrations from the Malay Archipelago,[3] in countries like Suriname via Indonesian immigrant communities,[4] and in the Netherlands through its colonial ties with Indonesia.[5] Nasi goreng is distinguished from other Asian fried rice preparations by its distinct smoky aroma, and caramelised yet savoury undertones of flavour. There is no single defined recipe for nasi goreng, and its composition and preparation varies greatly from household to household.","image":"Nasi_goreng_indonesia.jpg.webp","url":"Nasi_goreng"}
