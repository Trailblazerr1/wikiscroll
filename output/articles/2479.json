{"title":"Air mass","summary":"In meteorology, an air mass is a volume of air defined by its temperature and water vapor content.  Air masses cover many hundreds or thousands of  miles, and adapt to the characteristics of the surface below them. They are classified according to latitude and their continental or maritime source regions.  Colder air masses are termed polar or arctic, while warmer air masses are deemed tropical. Continental and superior air masses are dry while maritime and monsoon air masses are moist.   Weather fronts separate air masses with different density (temperature or moisture) characteristics. Once an air mass moves away from its source region, underlying vegetation and water bodies can quickly modify its character. Classification schemes tackle an air mass' characteristics, as well as modification.","image":"Airmassesorigin.png.webp"}
