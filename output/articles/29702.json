{"title":"Michael reaction","summary":"The Michael reaction or Michael addition is the nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile[1][2] to an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound containing an electron withdrawing group. It belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C–C bonds.[3] Many asymmetric variants exist.[4][5]","image":"Michael_Reaction_general.svg.png.webp","url":"Michael_reaction"}
