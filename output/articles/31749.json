{"title":"Neuropathic pain","summary":"Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system.[1][2] Neuropathic pain may be associated with abnormal sensations called dysesthesia or pain from normally non-painful stimuli (allodynia). It may have continuous and/or episodic (paroxysmal) components. The latter resemble stabbings or electric shocks. Common qualities include burning or coldness, \"pins and needles\" sensations, numbness and itching.[2]","image":"Gate_control_A_firing.svg.png.webp","url":"Neuropathic_pain"}
