{"title":"Cypriot Greek","summary":"Cypriot Greek (Greek: κυπριακά ελληνικά locally [cipriaˈka elːiniˈka] or κυπριακά [cipriaˈka]) is the variety of Modern Greek that is spoken by the majority of the Cypriot populace and Greek Cypriot diaspora. It is considered a divergent dialect as it differs from Standard Modern Greek[note 2] in various aspects of its lexicon,[2] phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and even pragmatics,[3] not only for historical reasons, but also because of geographical isolation, different settlement patterns, and extensive contact with typologically distinct languages.[4]","image":"Flag_of_Cyprus.svg.png.webp"}
