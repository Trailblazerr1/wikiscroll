{"title":"Phylogenetic nomenclature","summary":"Phylogenetic nomenclature is a method of nomenclature for taxa in biology that uses phylogenetic definitions for taxon names as explained below. This contrasts with the traditional approach, in which taxon names are defined by a type, which can be a specimen or a taxon of lower rank, and a description in words.[1] Phylogenetic nomenclature is currently regulated by the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature (PhyloCode).","image":"Clade_names_and_phylogenetic_hypotheses.svg.png.webp"}
