{"title":"Hyperthyroidism","summary":"Hyperthyroidism is the condition that occurs due to excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.[3] Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.[3]  It is noted that thyrotoxicosis is related to hyper-kinetic movement disorders including chorea and myoclonus.[4] Some, however, use the terms interchangeably.[5] Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, hand tremor, and weight loss.[1] Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy.[1] An uncommon complication is thyroid storm in which an event such as an infection results in worsening symptoms such as confusion and a high temperature and often results in death.[2] The opposite is hypothyroidism, when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone.[6]","image":"Triiodothyronine.svg.png.webp"}
