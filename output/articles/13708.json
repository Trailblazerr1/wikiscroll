{"title":"Dub music","summary":"Dub is a genre of electronic music[1] that grew out of reggae in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and is commonly considered a subgenre, though it has developed to extend beyond the scope of reggae.[2] The style consists predominantly of partly or completely instrumental remixes of existing recordings[3] and is achieved by significantly manipulating and reshaping the recordings, usually through the removal of some or all of the vocals, emphasis of the rhythm section (the stripped-down drum-and-bass track is sometimes referred to as a riddim), the application of studio effects such as echo and reverb, and the occasional dubbing of vocal or instrumental snippets from the original version or other works. It was an early form of popular electronic music.[4]","image":"Lee_Perry_live.jpg.webp"}
