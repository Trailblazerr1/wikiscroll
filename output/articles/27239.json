{"title":"Loki","summary":"Loki (Old Norse: [ˈloki], often Anglicized as /ˈloʊki/) is a god in Norse mythology. According to some sources, Loki is  the son of Fárbauti (a  jötunn) and Laufey (mentioned as a goddess), and the brother of Helblindi and Býleistr. Loki is married to Sigyn and they have a son, Narfi and/or Nari. By the jötunn Angrboða, Loki is the father of Hel, the wolf Fenrir, and the world serpent Jörmungandr.  Loki, in the form of a mare, was impregnated by the stallion Svaðilfari and gave birth to the eight-legged horse Sleipnir. Loki is referred to as the father of Váli in Prose Edda, though this source also refers to Odin as the father of Váli twice, and Váli is found mentioned as a son of Loki only once.","image":"Processed_SAM_loki.jpg.webp","url":"Loki"}
