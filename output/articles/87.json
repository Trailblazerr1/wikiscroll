{"title":"1689 Boston revolt","summary":"The 1689 Boston revolt was a popular uprising on April 18, 1689 against the rule of Sir Edmund Andros, the governor of the Dominion of New England.  A well-organized \"mob\" of provincial militia and citizens formed in the town of Boston, the capital of the dominion, and arrested dominion officials. Members of the Church of England were also taken into custody if they were believed to sympathize with the administration of the dominion. Neither faction sustained casualties during the revolt.  Leaders of the former Massachusetts Bay Colony then reclaimed control of the government.  In other colonies, members of governments displaced by the dominion were returned to power.","image":"AndrosaPrisonerInBoston.png.webp"}
