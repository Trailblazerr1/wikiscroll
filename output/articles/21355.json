{"title":"I, Tonya","summary":"I, Tonya is a 2017 American biographical sports black comedy film directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Steven Rogers. It follows the life of figure skater Tonya Harding and her connection to the 1994 attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan. The film states that it is based on \"contradictory\" and \"true\" interviews with Harding and her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, suggesting they are unreliable narrators.[5] It features darkly comedic interviews with the characters in mockumentary-style, set in the modern day, and breaks the fourth wall. Margot Robbie (who also produced) stars as Harding, Sebastian Stan as Gillooly, and Allison Janney as Harding's mother LaVona Golden. Julianne Nicholson, Caitlin Carver, Paul Walter Hauser, and Bobby Cannavale also star.","image":"I%2C_Tonya_(2017_film).png.webp","url":"I,_Tonya"}
