{"title":"Anno Domini","summary":"The terms anno Domini (AD) and before Christ (BC)[note 1] are used to label or number years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. The term anno Domini is Medieval Latin and means \"in the year of the Lord\",[1] but is often presented using \"our Lord\" instead of \"the Lord\",[2][3] taken from the full original phrase \"anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi\", which translates to \"in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ\".","image":"Austria_Klagenfurt_Dome_12.jpg.webp","url":"Anno_Domini"}
