{"title":"Skandha","summary":"Skandhas (Sanskrit) or khandhas (Pāḷi) means \"heaps, aggregates, collections, groupings\".[1] In Buddhism, it refers to the five aggregates of clinging (Pañcupādānakkhandhā), the five material and mental factors that take part in the rise of craving and clinging. They are also explained as the five factors that constitute and explain a sentient being’s person and personality,[2][3][4] but this is a later interpretation in response to sarvastivadin essentialism.","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp"}
