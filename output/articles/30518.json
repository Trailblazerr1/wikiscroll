{"title":"More popular than Jesus","summary":"\"More popular than Jesus\"[nb 1] is  part of a remark made by John Lennon of the Beatles in a March 1966 interview, in which he argued that the public were more infatuated with the band than with Jesus, and that Christian faith was declining to the extent that it might be outlasted by rock music. His opinions drew no controversy when originally published in the London newspaper The Evening Standard, but drew angry reactions from Christian communities when republished in the United States that July.","image":"Beatles_burning.jpg.webp","url":"More_popular_than_Jesus"}
