{"title":"Harry Nilsson","summary":"Harry Edward Nilsson III (June 15, 1941 – January 15, 1994), known professionally as Nilsson, was an American singer-songwriter who achieved the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a 3+1⁄2 octave range, Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours.[2] The craft of his songs and the defiant attitude he projected remain touchstones for later generations of indie rock musicians.[3]","image":"Harry_Nilsson_(1974)_(tall).png.webp"}
