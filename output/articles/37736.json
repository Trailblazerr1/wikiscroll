{"title":"Retail","summary":"Retail is the sale of goods and services to consumers, in contrast to wholesaling, which is sale to business or institutional customers. A retailer purchases goods in large quantities from manufacturers, directly or through a wholesaler, and then sells in smaller quantities to consumers for a profit. Retailers are the final link in the supply chain from producers to consumers. Shopping generally refers to the act of buying products. Sometimes this is done to obtain final goods, including necessities such as food and clothing; sometimes it takes place as a recreational activity. Recreational shopping often involves window shopping and browsing: it does not always result in a purchase.","image":"Comercio_en_la_plaza_del_9_de_abril_de_1947%2C_TÃ¡nger%2C_Marruecos%2C_2015-12-11%2C_DD_78.JPG.webp"}
