{"title":"Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame","summary":"The Wrestling Observer Newsletter (WON) Hall of Fame is a professional wrestling hall of fame that recognizes people who make significant contributions to their professions. It was founded in 1996 by Dave Meltzer, editor of the newsletter, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Like many other wrestling halls of fame, such as the WWE, Impact, and WCW halls of fame, the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame is not contained in a building, and there are no ceremonies for inductions other than a highly detailed biographical documentation of their career in the newsletter. Inductees include wrestlers/fighters, managers, promoters, trainers, and commentators. On eight occasions, tag teams have been inducted rather than the individual members of the team. This first occurred in 1996, when The Dusek family, The Fabulous Kangaroos, and The Road Warriors entered the hall. The Fabulous Freebirds, The Midnight Express, The Rock 'n' Roll Express, The Assassins and The Sharpe Brothers have also been inducted as groups. In addition; the first trio was inducted in 2019, when Los Misioneros de la Muerte were voted in.","image":"AbdullahTheButcher.jpg.webp","url":"Wrestling_Observer_Newsletter_Hall_of_Fame"}
