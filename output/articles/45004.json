{"title":"Thomas Wolsey","summary":"Thomas Wolsey[lower-alpha 1] (c. March 1473[1] – 29 November 1530) was an English statesman and Catholic bishop. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the king's almoner.[2] Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state. He also held important ecclesiastical appointments. These included the Archbishopric of York—the second most important role in the English church—and that of papal legate. His appointment as a cardinal by Pope Leo X in 1515 gave him precedence over all other English clergy.","image":"Cardinal_Thomas_Wolsey.jpg.webp","url":"Thomas_Wolsey"}
