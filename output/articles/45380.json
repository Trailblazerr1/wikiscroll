It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on December 1, 2015; the game was also released for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S exactly five years later on December 1, 2020. The game puts heavy emphasis on environmental destruction and cooperation between players. Each player assumes control of an attacker or a defender in different gameplay modes such as rescuing a hostage, defusing a bomb, and taking control of an objective within a room. The title has no campaign but features a series of short, offline missions called, \"situations\" that can be played solo. These missions have a loose narrative, focusing on recruits going through training to prepare them for future encounters with the \"White Masks\", a terrorist group that threatens the safety of the world.","image":"Tom_Clancy's_Rainbow_Six_Siege_cover_art.jpg.webp"}
