{"title":"Computer multitasking","summary":"In computing, multitasking is the concurrent execution of multiple tasks (also known as processes) over a certain period of time.  New tasks can interrupt already started ones before they finish, instead of waiting for them to end. As a result, a computer executes segments of multiple tasks in an interleaved manner, while the tasks share common processing resources such as central processing units (CPUs) and main memory. Multitasking automatically interrupts the running program, saving its state (partial results, memory contents and computer register contents) and loading the saved state of another program and transferring control to it. This \"context switch\" may be initiated at fixed time intervals (pre-emptive multitasking), or the running program may be coded to signal to the supervisory software when it can be interrupted (cooperative multitasking).","image":"Desktop-Linux-Mint.png.webp","url":"Computer_multitasking"}
