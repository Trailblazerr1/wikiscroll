{"title":"Marathi people","summary":"The Marathi people, also rendered as Marathis or Maharashtrian, are an ethnolinguistic group who speak Marathi, an Indo-Aryan language, as their native language. They inhabit the state of Maharashtra in modern India, which was formed as a Marathi-speaking state in 1960 as part of a nationwide linguistic reorganization of the Indian states. The term \"Maratha\" is generally used by historians to refer to all Marathi-speaking peoples, irrespective of caste.[8] At present, however, it also refers to a set of Maharashtrian castes called Maratha.[9]","image":"Flag_of_India.svg.png.webp","url":"Marathi_people"}
