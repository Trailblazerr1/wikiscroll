{"title":"2016 World Series","summary":"The 2016 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2016 season. The 112th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Chicago Cubs and the American League (AL) champion Cleveland Indians, the first meeting of those franchises in postseason history. The series was played between October 25 and November 2 (although Game 7 ended slightly after 12:00 am local time on November 3). The Indians had home-field advantage because the AL had won the 2016 All-Star Game.[2][3][4] This was the final World Series to have home-field advantage determined by the All-Star Game results; since 2017, home-field advantage has been awarded to the team with the better record. Many consider the 2016 World Series to be one of the best of all time, due to the games being tightly contested and the underdog story behind both teams.","image":"2016_World_Series_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"2016_World_Series"}
