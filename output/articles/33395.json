{"title":"Osteoblast","summary":"Osteoblasts (from the Greek combining forms for \"bone\", ὀστέο-, osteo- and βλαστάνω, blastanō \"germinate\") are cells with a single nucleus that synthesize bone. However, in the process of bone formation, osteoblasts function in groups of connected cells. Individual cells cannot make bone. A group of organized osteoblasts together with the bone made by a unit of cells is usually called the osteon.","image":"Bone_hypercalcemia_-_cropped_-_very_high_mag.jpg.webp","url":"Osteoblast"}
