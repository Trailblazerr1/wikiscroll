{"title":"Pandya dynasty","summary":"The Pandya dynasty, also known as the Pandyas of Madurai, was a dynasty of south India, one of the three famous Tamil lineages, the other two being the Chola and the Chera.[5]  Extant since at least the 4th to 3rd centuries BC, the dynasty passed through two periods of imperial dominance, the 6th to 10th centuries CE, and under the 'Later Pandyas' (13th to 14th centuries CE). The Pandyas ruled extensive territories, at times including the large portions of present-day south India and northern Sri Lanka through collateral branches subject to Madurai.[6][7]","image":"Twin_fish_flag_of_Pandyas.svg.png.webp","url":"Pandya_dynasty"}
