{"title":"Krishnaism","summary":"Krishnaism (IAST: Kṛṣṇaism) is a large group of independent Hindu traditions—sampradayas related to Vaishnavism—that center on the devotion to Krishna as Svayam Bhagavan, Ishvara, Para Brahman, the source of all reality, who is not an avatar of Vishnu.[1][note 1] This is its difference from such Vaishnavite groupings as Sri Vaishnavism, Sadh Vaishnavism, Ramaism, Radhaism, Sitaism, etc.[3] There is also a personal Krishnaism, i.e. devotion to Krishna outside of any tradition and community, as in the case of the sant-poet Meera Bai.[3] Some scholars do not define Krishnaism as a suborder or offshoot of Vaishnavism, considering it a parallel and no less ancient current of Hinduism.","image":"Krishna_Holding_Mount_Govardhan_-_Crop.jpg.webp"}
