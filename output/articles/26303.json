{"title":"Lipid","summary":"In biology and biochemistry, a lipid is a micro biomolecule that is soluble in nonpolar solvents.[3]  Non-polar solvents are typically hydrocarbons used to dissolve other naturally occurring hydrocarbon lipid molecules that do not (or do not easily) dissolve in water, including fatty acids, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamins A, D, E, and K), monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, and phospholipids.","image":"Common_lipids_lmaps.png.webp"}
