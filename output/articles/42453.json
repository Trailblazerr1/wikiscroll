{"title":"Strategy (game theory)","summary":"In game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options which they choose in a setting where the outcome depends not only on their own actions but on the actions of others.[1] The discipline mainly concerns the action of a player in a game affecting the behavior or actions of other players. Some examples of \"games\" include chess, bridge, poker, monopoly, diplomacy or battleship.[2] A player's strategy will determine the action which the player will take at any stage of the game. In studying game theory, economists enlist a more rational lens in analyzing decisions rather than the psychological or sociological perspectives taken when analyzing relationships between decisions of two or more parties in different disciplines.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Strategy_(game_theory)"}
