{"title":"Neal Dow","summary":"Neal Dow (March 20, 1804 â€“ October 2, 1897) was an American Prohibition advocate and politician. Nicknamed the \"Napoleon of Temperance\" and the \"Father of Prohibition\", Dow was born to a Quaker family in Portland, Maine. From a young age, he believed alcohol to be the cause of many of society's problems and wanted to ban it through legislation. In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union, and the next year he was elected mayor of Portland. Soon after, largely due to Dow's efforts, the state legislature banned the sale and production of alcohol in what became known as the Maine law. Serving twice as mayor of Portland, Dow enforced the law with vigor and called for increasingly harsh penalties for violators. In 1855, his opponents rioted and he ordered the state militia to fire on the crowd. One man was killed and several wounded, and when public reaction to the violence turned against Dow, he chose not to seek reelection.","image":"Neal_Dow_daguerreotype.jpg.webp"}
