{"title":"Hashimoto's thyroiditis","summary":"Hashimoto's thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed.[1][6] Early on, symptoms may not be noticed.[1] Over time, the thyroid may enlarge, forming a painless goiter.[1] Some people eventually develop hypothyroidism with accompanying weight gain, fatigue, constipation, depression, hair loss, and general pains.[1] After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size.[1] Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma.[2] Furthermore, because it is common for untreated patients of Hashimotoâ€™s to develop hypothyroidism, further complications can include, but are not limited to, high cholesterol, heart disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, myxedema, and potential pregnancy problems.[7]","image":"Hashimoto_thyroiditis_-_alt_--_very_low_mag.jpg.webp","url":"Hashimoto's_thyroiditis"}
