{"title":"Metropolitan line","summary":"The Metropolitan line, colloquially known as the Met, is a London Underground line between Aldgate in the City of London and Amersham and Chesham in Buckinghamshire, with branches to Watford in Hertfordshire and Uxbridge in Hillingdon. Printed in magenta on the tube map, the line is 41.4 miles (66.7Â km) in length and serves 34 stations (9 of which are step free). Between Aldgate and Finchley Road, the track is mostly in shallow \"cut and cover\" tunnels, apart from short sections at Barbican and Farringdon stations. The rest of the line is above ground, with a loading gauge of a similar size to those on main lines. Just under 67 million passenger journeys were made on the line in 2011/12.","image":"Metropolitan_line_flag_box.svg.png.webp"}
