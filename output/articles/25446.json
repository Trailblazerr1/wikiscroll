{"title":"Land","summary":"Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.[1] Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources. Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in bodies of water.","image":"AYool_topography_15min.png.webp","url":"Land"}
