{"title":"Viceroy","summary":"A viceroy (/ˈvaɪsrɔɪ/) is an official who runs a polity in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory. The term derives from the Latin prefix vice-, meaning \"in the place of\" and the French word roy, meaning \"king\".[1][2] A viceroy's territory may be called a viceroyalty, though this term is not always applied. The adjective form is viceregal,[3] less often viceroyal.[4] The term vicereine is sometimes used to indicate a female viceroy suo jure, although viceroy can serve as a gender-neutral term.[5] Vicereine is more commonly used to indicate a viceroy's wife.[5]","image":"Heraldic_Imperial_Crown_(Gules_Mitre).svg.png.webp","url":"Viceroy"}
