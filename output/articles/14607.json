{"title":"Elliptic-curve cryptography","summary":"Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. ECC allows smaller keys compared to non-EC cryptography (based on plain Galois fields) to provide equivalent security.[1]","image":"fc86af15bc8199a9f34988f2928839b91d3ddd88.svg"}
