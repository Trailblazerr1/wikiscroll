{"title":"Opioid","summary":"Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to produce morphine-like effects.[2] Medically they are primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia.[3] Other medical uses include suppression of diarrhea, replacement therapy for opioid use disorder, reversing opioid overdose, suppressing cough,[3] as well as for executions in the United States. Extremely potent opioids such as carfentanil are approved only for veterinary use.[4][5][6] Opioids are also frequently used non-medically for their euphoric effects or to prevent withdrawal.[7]","image":"Morphin_-_Morphine.svg.png.webp"}
