{"title":"Chaperone (protein)","summary":"Chaperone proteins participate in the folding of over half of all mammalian proteins. In molecular biology, molecular chaperones are proteins that assist the conformational folding or unfolding and the assembly or disassembly of other macromolecular structures. Chaperones are present when the macromolecules perform their normal biological functions and have correctly completed the processes of folding and/or assembly. The chaperones are concerned primarily with protein folding. The first protein to be called a chaperone assists the assembly of nucleosomes from folded histones and DNA and such assembly chaperones, especially in the nucleus,[1][2] are concerned with the assembly of folded subunits into oligomeric structures.[3]","image":"GroES-GroEL_top.png.webp","url":"Chaperone_(protein)"}
