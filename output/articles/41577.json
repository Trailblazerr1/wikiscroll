{"title":"Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster","summary":"The Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (Space Shuttle SRB) was the first solid-propellant rocket to be used for primary propulsion on a vehicle used for human spaceflight[1] and provided 85% of the Space Shuttle's thrust at liftoff and for the first two minutes of ascent. After burnout, they were jettisoned and parachuted into the Atlantic Ocean where they were recovered, examined, refurbished, and reused.","image":"Two_Space_Shuttle_SRBs_on_the_Crawler_transporter.jpg.webp","url":"Space_Shuttle_Solid_Rocket_Booster"}
