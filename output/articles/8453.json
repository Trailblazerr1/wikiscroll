{"title":"Cantor's theorem","summary":"In elementary set theory, Cantor's theorem is a fundamental result which states that, for any set A {\\displaystyle A} , the set of all subsets of A {\\displaystyle A} (the power set of A {\\displaystyle A} , denoted by P ( A ) {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {P}}(A)} ) has a strictly greater cardinality than A {\\displaystyle A} itself. For finite sets, Cantor's theorem can be seen to be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets. Counting the empty set as a subset, a set with n {\\displaystyle n} members has a total of 2 n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}} subsets, so that if card ⁡ ( A ) = n , {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {card} (A)=n,} then card ⁡ ( P ( A ) ) = 2 n {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {card} ({\\mathcal {P}}(A))=2^{n}} , and the theorem holds because 2 n > n {\\displaystyle 2^{n}>n} for all non-negative integers.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg","url":"Cantor's_theorem"}
