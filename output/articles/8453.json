{"title":"Cantor's theorem","summary":"In elementary set theory, Cantor's theorem is a fundamental result which states that, for any set \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n, the set of all subsets of \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n (the power set of \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n, denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            P\n          \n        \n        (\n        A\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {P}}(A)}\n  \n) has a strictly greater cardinality than \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A}\n  \n itself. For finite sets, Cantor's theorem can be seen to be true by simple enumeration of the number of subsets. Counting the empty set as a subset, a set with \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n members has a total of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n}}\n  \n subsets, so that if \n  \n    \n      \n        card\n        ⁡\n        (\n        A\n        )\n        =\n        n\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {card} (A)=n,}\n  \n then \n  \n    \n      \n        card\n        ⁡\n        (\n        \n          \n            P\n          \n        \n        (\n        A\n        )\n        )\n        =\n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\operatorname {card} ({\\mathcal {P}}(A))=2^{n}}\n  \n, and the theorem holds because \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        >\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{n}>n}\n  \n for all non-negative integers.","image":"7daff47fa58cdfd29dc333def748ff5fa4c923e3.svg"}
