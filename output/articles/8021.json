{"title":"Bézier curve","summary":"A Bézier curve (/ˈbɛz.i.eɪ/ BEH-zee-ay)[1] is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields.[2] The curves, which are related to Bernstein polynomials, are named after French engineer Pierre Bézier, who used it in the 1960s for designing curves for the bodywork of Renault cars.[3] Other uses include the design of computer fonts and animation.[3] Bézier curves can be combined to form a Bézier spline, or generalized to higher dimensions to form Bézier surfaces.[3] The Bézier triangle is a special case of the latter.","image":"Bezier_curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Bézier_curve"}
