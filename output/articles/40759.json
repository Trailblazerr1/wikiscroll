{"title":"Simultaneous game","summary":"In game theory, a simultaneous game or static game[1] is a game where each player chooses their action without knowledge of the actions chosen by other players.[2] Simultaneous games contrast with sequential games, which are played by the players taking turns (moves alternate between players). In other words, both players normally act at the same time in a simultaneous game. Even if the players do not act at the same time, both players are uninformed of each other's move while making their decisions.[3] Game theory utilizes rational analysis, rather than psychological or sociological, to determine the actions of decision maker.[4] Normal form representations are usually used for simultaneous games.[5] Given a continuous game, players will have different information sets if the game is simultaneous than if it is sequential because they have less information to act on at each step in the game. For example, in a two player continuous game that is sequential, the second player can act in response to the action taken by the first player. However, this is not possible in a simultaneous game where both players act at the same time. Game theory is typically used in economics, political science, military tactics, biology, and even computer science. The implications of being able to accurately determine decisions through rationality has had radically effects.","image":"Roshambo-Laos.jpg.webp","url":"Simultaneous_game"}
