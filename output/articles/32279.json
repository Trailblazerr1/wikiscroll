{"title":"Nondualism","summary":"In spirituality, nondualism, also called nonduality and interconnectedness;[1][2][3] and nondual awareness,[4][5] is a fuzzy concept, for which many definitions can be found,[note 1] that is differentiated from dualistic, and possibly pluralistic, cosmologies.[6] The term is derived from \"advaita\" (अद्वैत), \"not-two\"[1][7] or \"one without a second\".[7] While \"advaita\" is primarily related to the Hindu philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, nondualism refers to several, related strands of thought, and there is no single definition for the English word \"nonduality.\" According to David Loy it is best to speak of various \"nondualities\" or theories of nonduality.[8]","image":"Asianphilsidebar.jpg.webp","url":"Nondualism"}
