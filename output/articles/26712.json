Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage.[2] The Slovak Republic ratified the convention on 31 March 1993, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.[3]","image":"Slovakia_location_map.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Slovakia"}
