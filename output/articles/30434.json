{"title":"Montanism","summary":"Montanism (/ˈmɒntəˌnɪzəm/), known by its adherents as the New Prophecy, was an early Christian movement of the late 2nd century, later referred to by the name of its founder, Montanus.[1] Montanism held views about the basic tenets of Christian theology similar to those of the wider Christian Church, but it was labelled a heresy for its belief in new prophetic revelations.[2][3] The prophetic movement called for a reliance on the spontaneity of the Holy Spirit and a more conservative personal ethic.[2] Parallels have been drawn between Montanism and modern-day movements such as Pentecostalism (including Oneness Pentecostals) and the Charismatic movement.[4][5]","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp"}
