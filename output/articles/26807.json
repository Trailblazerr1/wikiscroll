{"title":"List of counties in Utah","summary":"There are 29 counties in the U.S. state of Utah.  There were originally seven counties established under the provisional State of Deseret in 1849:  Davis, Iron, Sanpete, Salt Lake, Tooele, Utah, and Weber.[1]  The Territory of Utah was created in 1851 with the first territorial legislature meeting from 1851–1852.  The first legislature re-created the original counties from the State of Deseret under territorial law as well as establishing three additional counties:  Juab, Millard, and Washington.  All other counties were established between 1854 and 1894 by the Utah Territorial Legislature under territorial law except for the last two counties formed, Daggett and Duchesne.  They were created by popular vote and by gubernatorial proclamation after Utah became a state.[2]  Present-day Duchesne County encompassed an Indian reservation that was created in 1861.  The reservation was opened to homesteaders in 1905 and the county was created in 1913.[3]  Due to dangerous roads, mountainous terrain, and bad weather preventing travel via a direct route, 19th century residents in present-day Daggett County had to travel 400 to 800 miles (640 to 1,290 km) on both stage and rail to conduct business in Vernal, the county seat for Uintah County a mere 50 miles (80 km) away.  In 1917, all Uintah County residents voted to create Daggett County.[4]","image":"Utah_Locator_Map.PNG.webp","url":"List_of_counties_in_Utah"}
