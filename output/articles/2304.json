{"title":"Aetosaur","summary":"Aetosaurs (/eɪˌɛtoʊˈsɔːr/) were heavily armored reptiles belonging to the extinct order Aetosauria (/eɪˌɛtoʊˈsɔːriə/; from Greek, ἀετός (aetos, \"eagle\") and σαυρος (sauros, \"lizard\")). They were medium- to large-sized omnivorous or herbivorous pseudosuchians, part of the branch of archosaurs more closely related to crocodilians than to birds (and other dinosaurs). All known aetosaurs are restricted to the Late Triassic, and in some strata from this time they are among the most abundant fossil vertebrates. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body ornamented with four rows of plate-like osteoderms (bony scutes). Aetosaur fossil remains are known from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their armoured plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, the presence of particular aetosaurs can accurately date a site that they are found in.[1][2][3]","image":"Typothorax_coccinarum.jpg.webp","url":"Aetosaur"}
