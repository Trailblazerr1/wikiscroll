{"title":"Fork (software development)","summary":"In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software. The term often implies not merely a development branch, but also a split in the developer community; as such, it is a form of schism.[1] Grounds for forking are varying user preferences and stagnated or discontinued development of the original software.","image":"Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg.png.webp","url":"Fork_(software_development)"}
