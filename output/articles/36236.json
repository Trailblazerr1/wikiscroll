{"title":"Proletariat","summary":"The proletariat (/ˌproʊlɪˈtɛəriət/; from Latin  proletarius 'producing offspring') is the social class of wage-earners, those members of a society whose only possession of significant economic value is their labour power (their capacity to work).[1] A member of such a class is a proletarian. Marxist philosophy considers the proletariat to be exploited under capitalism, forced to accept meager wages in return for operating the means of production, which belong to the class of business owners, the bourgeoisie.","image":"Co-op_activism5.svg.png.webp","url":"Proletariat"}
