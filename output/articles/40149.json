{"title":"Settlement of the Americas","summary":"The settlement of the Americas is widely accepted to have begun when Paleolithic hunter-gatherers entered North America from the North Asian Mammoth steppe via the Beringia land bridge, which had formed between northeastern Siberia and western Alaska due to the lowering of sea level during the Last Glacial Maximum (26,000 to 19,000 years ago).[1]\nThese populations expanded south of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and spread rapidly throughout both North and South America, by 14,000 years ago.[2][3][4][5] The earliest populations in the Americas, before roughly 10,000 years ago, are known as Paleo-Indians.","image":"Pre-clovis-sites-of-the-americas.svg.png.webp"}
