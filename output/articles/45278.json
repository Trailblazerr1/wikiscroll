{"title":"Tirthankara","summary":"In Jainism, a Tirthankara (Sanskrit: tīrthaṅkara; English: literally a 'ford-maker') is a saviour and spiritual teacher of the dharma (righteous path).[1] The word tirthankara signifies the founder of a tirtha,[2] which is a fordable passage across the sea of interminable births and deaths, the saṃsāra. According to Jains, a Tirthankara is an individual who has conquered the saṃsāra, the cycle of death and rebirth, on their own, and made a path for others to follow.[3] After understanding the true nature of the self or soul, the Tīrthaṅkara attains Kevala Jnana (omniscience).  Tirthankara provides a bridge for others to follow the new teacher from saṃsāra to moksha (liberation).[4]","image":"Jain_24-Tirthankaras.jpg.webp","url":"Tirthankara"}
