{"title":"Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame","summary":"The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame was the first hall of fame built to honor a single professional American football team. John P. Holloway, a Brown County administrator and arena director, and William L. Brault, a Green Bay restaurateur and Packers fan, co-founded the Packer Hall of Fame museum[1] in 1966. According to them, they got the idea after visitors to Green Bay would repeatedly ask about the Packers' storied history. Sensing opportunity, they went to Packers head coach Vince Lombardi, suggesting a Hall of Fame should be made to attract and educate tourists about the Packers and their history. Lombardi gave them his approval, and according to Brault, as he left his office, Lombardi called out to him, \"Don't screw it up!\"","image":"PackersHoF-edit.jpg.webp"}
