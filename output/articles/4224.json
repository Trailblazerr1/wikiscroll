{"title":"Arab–Israeli conflict","summary":"The Arab–Israeli conflict involves political tension, military conflicts, and other disputes between Arab countries and Israel, which escalated during the 20th century, but had mostly faded out by the early 21st century. The roots of the Arab–Israeli conflict have been attributed to the support by Arab League member countries for the Palestinians, a fellow League member, in the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which in turn has been attributed to the simultaneous rise of Zionism and Arab nationalism towards the end of the 19th century, though the two national movements had not clashed until the 1920s.","image":"Arab-Israeli_Conflict_Key_Players.svg.png.webp","url":"Arab–Israeli_conflict"}
