{"title":"DNA sequencing","summary":"DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence â€“ the order of nucleotides in DNA. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.[1][2]","image":"Hybridogenesis_in_water_frogs_gametes.svg.png.webp"}
