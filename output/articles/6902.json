{"title":"Blended learning","summary":"Blended learning, also known as hybrid learning, is an approach to education that combines online educational materials and opportunities for interaction online with traditional place-based classroom methods. It requires the physical presence of both teacher and student, with some elements of student control over time, place, path, or pace.[1][2][3] While students still attend \"brick-and-mortar\" schools with a teacher present, face-to-face classroom practices are combined with computer-mediated activities regarding content and delivery.[4][5] Blended learning is also used in professional development and training settings.[6]","image":"Wikiversity_logo_2017.svg.png.webp","url":"Blended_learning"}
