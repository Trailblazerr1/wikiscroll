{"title":"Chickenpox","summary":"Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV).[3] The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over.[1] It usually starts on the chest, back, and face.[1] It then spreads to the rest of the body.[1] The rash and other symptoms, such as fever, tiredness, and headaches, usually last five to seven days.[1] Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections.[7] The disease is usually more severe in adults than in children.[8]","image":"Varicela_Aranzales.jpg.webp","url":"Chickenpox"}
