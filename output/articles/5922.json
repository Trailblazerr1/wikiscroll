{"title":"Battle of Towton","summary":"The Battle of Towton was fought on 29 March 1461 during the English Wars of the Roses, near the village of Towton in Yorkshire. It was \"probably the largest and bloodiest battle ever fought on English soil\".[4] An estimated 50,000Â soldiers fought for hours during a snowstorm on that day, which was Palm Sunday. It brought about a change of monarchs in England, with Edward IV displacing Henry VI, establishing the House of York on the English throne and driving the incumbent House of Lancaster and its key supporters out of the country.","image":"Richard_Caton_Woodville's_The_Battle_of_Towton.jpg.webp"}
