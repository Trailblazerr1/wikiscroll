{"title":"Peripheral artery disease","summary":"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is an abnormal narrowing of arteries other than those that supply the heart or brain.[5][15] When narrowing occurs in the heart, it is called coronary artery disease, and in the brain, it is called cerebrovascular disease.[4] Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved â€“ such as those of the arms, neck, or kidneys.[4][16] The classic symptom is leg pain when walking which resolves with rest, known as intermittent claudication.[2] Other symptoms include skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or abnormal nail and hair growth in the affected leg.[3] Complications may include an infection or tissue death which may require amputation; coronary artery disease, or stroke.[4] Up to 50% of people with PAD do not have symptoms.[2]","image":"Arterial_ulcer_peripheral_vascular_disease.jpg.webp","url":"Peripheral_artery_disease"}
