{"title":"Johnny Weir","summary":"John Weir (born July 2, 1984)[1] is an American figure skater and television commentator. He is a two-time Olympian, the 2008 World bronze medalist, a two-time Grand Prix Final bronze medalist, the 2001 World Junior Champion, and a three-time U.S. National champion (2004â€“2006). He began skating at the age of 12, two or three times older than when most elite skaters start training. He was the youngest U.S. National champion since 1991, in 2004 the first skater to win U.S. Nationals three times in a row since Brian Boitano in the late 1980s and the first American to win Cup of Russia in 2007. Weir had a classical skating style and was known for being \"a very lyrical skater\"[2] and \"an entertaining artesian\".[3] He was also influenced by Russian approaches to figure skating and developed a connection with Russian history, culture, and language. His costume choices and outspokenness caused conflicts with U.S. Figure Skating, the governing body of the sport in the U.S., throughout his skating career.","image":"JohnnyWeir2010.jpg.webp","url":"Johnny_Weir"}
