{"title":"Roman Rite","summary":"The Roman Rite (Latin: Ritus Romanus)[1] is the main liturgical rite of the Latin or Western Church, the largest of the sui iuris particular churches that make up the Catholic Church. It developed in the Latin language in the city of Rome and, while distinct Latin liturgical rites such as the Ambrosian Rite remain, the Roman Rite has over time been adopted almost everywhere in the Western Church. In medieval times there were very many local variants, even if they did not all amount to distinct rites, but uniformity grew as a result of the invention of printing and in obedience to the decrees of the 1545â€“1563 Council of Trent (see Quo primum). Several Latin liturgical rites that survived into the 20th century were abandoned voluntarily in the wake of the Second Vatican Council. The Roman Rite is now the most widespread liturgical rite not only in the Latin Church but in Christianity as a whole.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp","url":"Roman_Rite"}
