{"title":"Tupolev Tu-154","summary":"The Tupolev Tu-154 (Russian: Tyполев Ту-154; NATO reporting name: \"Careless\") is a three-engine medium-range narrow-body airliner designed in the mid-1960s and manufactured by Tupolev. A workhorse of Soviet and (subsequently) Russian airlines for several decades, it carried half of all passengers flown by Aeroflot and its subsidiaries (137.5 million/year or 243.8 billion passenger km in 1990), remaining the standard domestic-route airliner of Russia and former Soviet states until the mid-2000s. It was exported to 17 non-Russian airlines and used as a head-of-state transport by the air forces of several countries.","image":"Tu-154M_B-4029_20151127.jpg.webp"}
