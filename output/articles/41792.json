{"title":"Sponge spicule","summary":"Spicules are structural elements found in most sponges. Sponge spicules are made of calcium carbonate or silica. Large spicules visible to the naked eye are referred to as megascleres, while smaller, microscopic ones are termed microscleres. The meshing of many spicules serves as the sponge's skeleton and thus it provides structural support and potentially defense against predators.[1] The composition, size, and shape of spicules are major characters in sponge systematics and taxonomy.","image":"Sponge-spicule_hg.jpg.webp"}
