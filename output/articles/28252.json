{"title":"Mandala","summary":"A mandala (Sanskrit: मण्डल, romanized: maṇḍala, lit. 'circle', [ˈmɐɳɖɐlɐ]) is a geometric configuration of symbols. In various spiritual traditions, mandalas may be employed for focusing attention of practitioners and adepts, as a spiritual guidance tool, for establishing a sacred space and as an aid to meditation and trance induction. In the Eastern religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Shintoism it is used as a map representing deities, or especially in the case of Shintoism, paradises, kami or actual shrines.[1][2] A mandala generally represents the spiritual journey, starting from outside to the inner core, through layers.","image":"Manjuvajramandala_con_43_divinità_-_Unknown_-_Google_Cultural_Institute.jpg.webp"}
