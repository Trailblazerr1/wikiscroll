{"title":"Torah","summary":"The Torah (/ˈtɔːrə, ˈtoʊrə/; Hebrew: תּוֹרָה‎, \"Instruction\", \"Teaching\" or \"Law\") includes the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, named: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.[1] When used in that sense, Torah means the same as Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses. It is also known in the Jewish tradition as the Written Torah (תּוֹרָה כָתובָה, Torah Katuvah). If meant for liturgic purposes, it takes the form of a Torah scroll (Sefer Torah).","image":"Köln-Tora-und-Innenansicht-Synagoge-Glockengasse-040.JPG.webp"}
