{"title":"The Kinks","summary":"The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, north London, in 1963 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s.[3][4] The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \"You Really Got Me\",[4][5] became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.[6]","image":"Helmfrid-sofa4_Touched.JPG.webp","url":"The_Kinks"}
