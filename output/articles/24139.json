{"title":"July 2009 Ürümqi riots","summary":"The July 2009 Ürümqi riots[12] were a series of violent riots over several days that broke out on 5 July 2009 in Ürümqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), in Northwestern China. The first day's rioting, which involved at least 1,000 Uyghurs,[13] began as a protest but escalated into violent attacks that mainly targeted Han people. China's People's Armed Police were deployed and two days later hundreds of Han people clashed with both police and Uyghurs. PRC officials said that a total of 197 people died, most of whom were Hans,[10][7] with 1,721 others injured[8] and many vehicles and buildings destroyed. Many Uyghurs disappeared during wide-scale police sweeps in the days following the riots; Human Rights Watch (HRW) documented 43 cases[14] and said figures for real disappearances were likely to be much higher.[15]","image":"WLMQ_Cellphone_screenshots_2v1.jpg.webp"}
