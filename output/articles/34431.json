{"title":"Peptidoglycan","summary":"Peptidoglycan or murein is a polymer consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh-like peptidoglycan layer outside the plasma membrane of most bacteria, forming the cell wall. The sugar component consists of alternating residues of Î²-(1,4) linked N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). Attached to the N-acetylmuramic acid is a peptide chain of three to five amino acids. The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer.[1] Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall, giving structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. Peptidoglycan is also involved in binary fission during bacterial cell reproduction.","image":"Peptidoglycan_en.svg.png.webp"}
