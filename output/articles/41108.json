{"title":"Social Security Administration","summary":"The United States Social Security Administration (SSA)[2] is an independent agency of the U.S. federal government that administers Social Security, a social insurance program consisting of retirement, disability and survivor benefits. To qualify for most of these benefits, most workers pay Social Security taxes on their earnings; the claimant's benefits are based on the wage earner's contributions. Otherwise benefits such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are given based on need.","image":"US-SocialSecurityAdmin-Seal.svg.png.webp","url":"Social_Security_Administration"}
