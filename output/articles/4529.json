{"title":"Articulatory phonetics","summary":"The field of articulatory phonetics is a subfield of phonetics that studies articulation and ways that humans produce speech.  Articulatory phoneticians explain how humans produce speech sounds via the interaction of different physiological structures. Generally, articulatory phonetics is concerned with the transformation of aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy. Aerodynamic energy refers to the airflow through the vocal tract. Its potential form is air pressure; its kinetic form is the actual dynamic airflow. Acoustic energy is variation in the air pressure that can be represented as sound waves, which are then perceived by the human auditory system as sound.[1]","image":"Places_of_articulation.svg.png.webp","url":"Articulatory_phonetics"}
