{"title":"Red River of the North","summary":"The Red River (French: rivière Rouge or rivière Rouge du Nord, American English: Red River of the North) is a river in the north-central United States and central Canada. Originating at the confluence of the Bois de Sioux and Otter Tail rivers between the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota, it flows northward through the Red River Valley, forming most of the border of Minnesota and North Dakota and continuing into Manitoba. It empties into Lake Winnipeg, whose waters join the Nelson River and ultimately flow into Hudson Bay.","image":"Red_River_of_the_North_at_Fargo%2C_ND.jpg.webp"}
