{"title":"Mortal sin","summary":"A mortal sin (Latin: peccatum mortale), in Catholic theology, is a gravely sinful act, which can lead to damnation if a person does not repent of the sin before death. A sin is considered to be \"mortal\" when its quality is such that it leads to a separation of that person from God's saving grace. Three conditions must together be met for a sin to be mortal: \"Mortal sin is sin whose object is grave matter and which is also committed with full knowledge and deliberate consent.\"[1] The sin against the Holy Ghost and the sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance are considered especially serious.[2] This type of sin is distinguished from a venial sin that simply leads to a weakening of a person's relationship with God. Despite its gravity, a person can repent of having committed a mortal sin. Such repentance is the primary requisite for forgiveness and absolution.[3] Teaching on absolution from serious sins has varied somewhat throughout history. The current teaching for Catholics was formalized at the 16th-century Council of Trent.","image":"Исповедь_берн_собор.jpg.webp"}
