{"title":"Subarctic climate","summary":"The subarctic climate (also called subpolar climate, or boreal climate) is a climate characterised by long, usually very cold winters, and short, cool summers. It is found on large landmasses, often away from the moderating effects of an ocean, generally at latitudes from 50° to 70°N poleward of the humid continental climates. Subarctic or boreal climates are the source regions for the cold air that affects temperate latitudes to the south in winter. These climates represent Köppen climate classification Dfc, Dwc, Dsc, Dfd, Dwd and  Dsd.","image":"Köppen_World_Map_Dsc%2C_Dwc%2C_Dfc%2C_Dsd%2C_Dwd_and_Dfd_(Subarctic).svg.png.webp"}
