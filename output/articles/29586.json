{"title":"Mexican Repatriation","summary":"The Mexican Repatriation  was the repatriations and deportations of Mexican-Americans to Mexico from the United States during the Great Depression between 1929 and  1939.

Voluntary repatriation was far more common than formal deportation. The government formally deported at least 82,000 people.[1][4] The Mexican government also encouraged repatriation.[5]: 185–186","image":"Mexican_Repatriation%2C_1931.jpg.webp"}
