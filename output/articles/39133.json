{"title":"Salp","summary":"A salp (plural salps, also known colloquially as “sea grape”) or salpa (plural salpae or salpas[2]) is a barrel-shaped, planktic tunicate. It moves by contracting, thereby pumping water through its gelatinous body, one of the most efficient examples of jet propulsion in the animal kingdom.[3] The salp strains the pumped water through its internal feeding filters, feeding on phytoplankton.","image":"Salp.jpg.webp"}
