{"title":"Herpes labialis","summary":"Herpes labialis, commonly known as cold sores, is a type of infection by the herpes simplex virus that affects primarily the lip.[1] Symptoms typically include a burning pain followed by small blisters or sores.[1] The first attack may also be accompanied by fever, sore throat, and enlarged lymph nodes.[1][9] The rash usually heals within ten days, but the virus remains dormant in the trigeminal ganglion.[1] The virus may periodically reactivate to create another outbreak of sores in the mouth or lip.[1]","image":"Herpes(PHIL_1573_lores).jpg.webp"}
