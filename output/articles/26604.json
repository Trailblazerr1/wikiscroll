{"title":"List of Regular Show episodes","summary":"Regular Show is an American  animated comedy television series created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network. It ran from September 6, 2010, to January 16, 2017. The series revolves around the daily lives of two 23-year-old friends, Mordecai (a blue jay), and Rigby (a raccoon). They work as groundskeepers at a park, and spend their days trying to slack off and entertain themselves by any means. This is much to the chagrin of their boss Benson (a gumball machine) and their coworker Skips (a yeti), but to the delight of park manager Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Their other coworkers, Muscle Man (an overweight green man) and Hi-Five Ghost (a ghost with a hand extending from the top of his head) serve as their rivals.","image":"Regular_Show_logo.png.webp","url":"List_of_Regular_Show_episodes"}
