{"title":"Grise Fiord","summary":"Grise Fiord (/ɡriːz fiˈɔːrd/; Inuktitut: ᐊᐅᔪᐃᑦᑐᖅ, romanized: Aujuittuq, lit. 'place that never thaws') is an Inuit hamlet on the southern tip of Ellesmere Island, in the Qikiqtaaluk Region in the territory of Nunavut, Canada. It is one of three settlements on the island; despite its low population (129 residents as of the Canada 2016 Census),[3] it is the largest community (and only public community) on Ellesmere Island. The settlement at Grise Fiord, created by the Canadian Government in 1953 through a relocation of Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec, is the northernmost public community in Canada. It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of −16.5 °C (2.3 °F).","image":"Downtown_Grise_Fiord.jpg.webp","url":"Grise_Fiord"}
