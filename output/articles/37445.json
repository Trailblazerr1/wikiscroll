{"title":"Reduction potential","summary":"Redox potential (also known as oxidation / reduction potential, ORP, pe, E r e d {\\displaystyle E_{red}} , or E h {\\displaystyle E_{h}} ) is a measure of the tendency of a chemical species to acquire electrons from or lose electrons to an electrode and thereby be reduced or oxidised respectively. Redox potential is measured in volts (V), or millivolts (mV).  Each species has its own intrinsic redox potential; for example, the more positive the reduction potential (reduction potential is more often used due to general formalism in electrochemistry), the greater the species' affinity for electrons and tendency to be reduced. ORP can reflect the antimicrobial potential of the water.[1]","image":"e34e7aa544f223caef2a1a0d4cd2fc7b7a7da2fd.svg","url":"Reduction_potential"}
