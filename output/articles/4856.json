{"title":"Atrial natriuretic peptide","summary":"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a natriuretic peptide hormone secreted from the cardiac atria that in humans is encoded by the NPPA gene.[1] Natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, and CNP) are a family of hormone/paracrine factors that are structurally related.[2] The main function of ANP is causing a reduction in expanded extracellular fluid (ECF) volume by increasing renal sodium excretion. ANP is synthesized and secreted by cardiac muscle cells in the walls of the atria in the heart. These cells contain volume receptors which respond to increased stretching of the atrial wall due to increased atrial blood volume.","image":"ANP_Granules_in_a_Mouse_Model.png.webp"}
