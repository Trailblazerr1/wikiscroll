{"title":"Oscillation","summary":"Oscillation is the repetitive variation, typically in time, of some measure about a central value (often a point of equilibrium) or between two or more different states. The term vibration is precisely used to describe mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum and alternating current.","image":"Animated-mass-spring.gif","url":"Oscillation"}
