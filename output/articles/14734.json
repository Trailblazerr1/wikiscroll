{"title":"Emperor Jimmu","summary":"Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, Jinmu-tennō) was the legendary first emperor of Japan according to the Nihon Shoki and Kojiki.[1] His accession is traditionally dated as 660 BC.[3][4] In Japanese mythology, he was a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu, through her grandson Ninigi, as well as a descendant of the storm god Susanoo. He launched a military expedition from Hyuga near the Seto Inland Sea, captured Yamato, and established this as his center of power. In modern Japan, Jimmu's legendary accession is marked as National Foundation Day on February 11. In the 1930s and 1940s it was dangerous to question the existence of Jimmu.[5]","image":"Tennō_Jimmu_detail_01.jpg.webp"}
