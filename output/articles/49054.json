{"title":"X chromosome","summary":"The X chromosome is one of the two sex-determining chromosomes (allosomes) in many organisms, including mammals (the other is the Y chromosome), and is found in both males and females. It is a part of the XY sex-determination system and XO sex-determination system. The X chromosome was named for its unique properties by early researchers, which resulted in the naming of its counterpart Y chromosome, for the next letter in the alphabet, following its subsequent discovery.[5]","image":"Human_male_karyotpe_high_resolution_-_X_chromosome_cropped.png.webp","url":"X_chromosome"}
