{"title":"Hypopituitarism","summary":"Hypopituitarism is the decreased (hypo) secretion of one or more of the eight hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain.[1][2]  If there is decreased secretion of one specific pituitary hormone, the condition is known as selective hypopituitarism.[3]  If there is decreased secretion of most or all pituitary hormones, the term panhypopituitarism (pan meaning \"all\") is used.[4]","image":"Gray1180.png.webp"}
