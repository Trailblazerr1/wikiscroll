{"title":"Rashomon","summary":"Rashomon[lower-alpha 1] is a 1950 Jidaigeki psychological thriller/crime film directed by Akira Kurosawa, working in close collaboration with cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa.[2] Starring Toshiro Mifune, Machiko Kyō, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura as various people who describe how a samurai was murdered in a forest, the plot and characters are based upon Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s short story \"In a Grove\", with the title and framing story being based on \"Rashomon\", another short story by Akutagawa. Every element is largely identical, from the murdered samurai speaking through a  Shinto psychic to the bandit in the forest, the monk, the rape of the wife, and the dishonest retelling of the events in which everyone shows his or her ideal self by lying.[3]","image":"Rashomon_poster_3.jpg.webp","url":"Rashomon"}
