{"title":"Monte Verde","summary":"Monte Verde is an archaeological site in southern Chile, located near Puerto Montt, Southern Chile, which has been dated to as early as 18,500 cal BP (16,500 BC).[1] Previously, the widely accepted date for early occupation at Monte Verde was ~14,500 years cal BP.[2] This dating added to the evidence showing that the human settlement of the Americas pre-dates the Clovis culture by roughly 1000 years (or 5,000 years if the 18,500 BP dates are confirmed). This contradicts the previously accepted \"Clovis first\" model which holds that settlement of the Americas began after 13,500 cal BP. The Monte Verde findings were initially dismissed by most of the scientific community, but the evidence then became more accepted in archaeological circles.[2][3]","image":"Monte_Verde_2012.jpg.webp"}
