{"title":"Michelangelo Antonioni","summary":"Michelangelo Antonioni Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI (/ænˌtoʊniˈoʊni/, Italian: [mikeˈlandʒelo antoˈnjoːni]; 29 September 1912 – 30 July 2007) was an Italian film director, screenwriter, editor, and painter. He is best known for his \"trilogy on modernity and its discontents\"[1] – L'Avventura (1960), La Notte (1961), and L'Eclisse (1962) – as well as the English-language films Blowup (1966) and The Passenger (1975). His films have been described as \"enigmatic and intricate mood pieces\"[2] that feature elusive plots, striking visual composition, and a preoccupation with modern landscapes.[3] His work would substantially influence subsequent art cinema.[4]","image":"Michelangelo_Antonioni_portrait_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Michelangelo_Antonioni"}
