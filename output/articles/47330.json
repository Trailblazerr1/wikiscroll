{"title":"Vibrio cholerae","summary":"Vibrio cholerae is a species of Gram-negative, facultative anaerobe and comma-shaped bacteria.[1] The bacteria naturally live in brackish or saltwater where they attach themselves easily to the chitin-containing shells of crabs, shrimps, and other shellfish. Some strains of V. cholerae are pathogenic to humans and cause a deadly disease cholera, which can be derived from the consumption of undercooked or raw marine life species.[2]","image":"Cholera_bacteria_SEM.jpg.webp"}
