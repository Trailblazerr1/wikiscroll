{"title":"Plastid","summary":"The plastid (Greek: πλαστός; plastós: formed, molded – plural plastids) is a membrane-bound organelle[1] found in the cells of plants, algae, and some other eukaryotic organisms. They are considered to be intracellular endosymbiotic Cyanobacteria. Examples include chloroplasts (used for photosynthesis), chromoplasts (used for pigment synthesis and storage), and leucoplasts (non-pigmented plastids that can sometimes differentiate).","image":"Red_Pencil_Icon.png.webp","url":"Plastid"}
