{"title":"Kleptocracy","summary":"Kleptocracy (from Greek κλέπτης kléptēs, \"thief\", κλέπτω kléptō, \"I steal\", and -κρατία -kratía from κράτος krátos, \"power, rule\") is a wealth influenced (lobbied) government whose corrupt leaders (kleptocrats) use political power to appropriate the wealth of their nation, typically by embezzling or misappropriating government funds at the expense of the wider population.[1][2] Thievocracy means literally the rule by thievery and is a term used synonymously to kleptocracy.[3][4] One feature of political-based socioeconomic thievery is that there is often no public announcement explaining or apologizing for misappropriations, nor any legal charges or punishment levied against the offenders.[5]","image":"Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg.webp","url":"Kleptocracy"}
