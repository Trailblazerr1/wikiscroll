{"title":"Instrumental and intrinsic value","summary":"In moral philosophy, instrumental and intrinsic value are the distinction between what is a means to an end and what is as an end in itself.[1] Things are deemed to have instrumental value if they help one achieve a particular end; intrinsic values, by contrast, are understood to be desirable in and of themselves. A tool or appliance, such as a hammer or washing machine, has instrumental value because it helps you pound in a nail or cleans your clothes. Happiness and pleasure are typically considered to have intrinsic value insofar as asking why someone would want them makes little sense: they are desirable for their own sake irrespective of their possible instrumental value. The classic names instrumental and intrinsic were coined by sociologist Max Weber, who spent years studying good meanings people assigned to their actions and beliefs.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
