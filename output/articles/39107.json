{"title":"Salim Ali","summary":"Sálim Moizuddin Abdul Ali (12 November 1896 – 20 June 1987)[1] was an Indian ornithologist and naturalist. Sometimes referred to as the \"Birdman of India\", Salim Ali was the first Indian to conduct systematic bird surveys across India and wrote several bird books that popularized ornithology in India. He became a key figure behind the Bombay Natural History Society after 1947 and used his personal influence to garner government support for the organisation, create the Bharatpur bird sanctuary (Keoladeo National Park) and prevent the destruction of what is now the Silent Valley National Park.","image":"Salim_ali_mns.jpg.webp"}
