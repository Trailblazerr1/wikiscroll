{"title":"Nakalipithecus","summary":"Nakalipithecus nakayamai is an extinct species of great ape from Nakali, Kenya, from about 9.9â€“9.8 million years ago during the Late Miocene. It is known from a right jawbone with 3 molars and from 11 isolated teeth, and the specimen is presumed female as the teeth are similar in size to those of female gorillas and orangutans. Compared to other great apes, the canines are short, the enamel is thin, and the molars are flatter. Nakalipithecus is one of only three Late Miocene great apes known from Africa, the others being Samburupithecus and Chororapithecus. Nakalipithecus seems to have inhabited a sclerophyllous woodland environment.","image":"Nakalipithecus_mandible.jpg.webp","url":"Nakalipithecus"}
