{"title":"Hadron","summary":"In particle physics, a hadron /ˈhædrɒn/ (listen) (Ancient Greek: ἁδρός, romanized: hadrós; \"stout, thick\") is a composite subatomic particle made of two or more quarks held together by the strong interaction. They are analogous to molecules that are held together by the electric force. Most of the mass of ordinary matter comes from two hadrons: the proton and the neutron, while most of the mass of the protons and neutrons is in turn due to the binding energy of their constituent quarks, due to the strong force.","image":"Bosons-Hadrons-Fermions-RGB.svg.png.webp","url":"Hadron"}
