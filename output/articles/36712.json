{"title":"Quantum number","summary":"In chemistry and quantum physics, quantum numbers describe values of conserved quantities in the dynamics of a quantum system.  Quantum numbers correspond to eigenvalues of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian—quantities that can be known with precision at the same time as the system's energy[note 1]—and their corresponding eigenspaces. Together, a specification of all of the quantum numbers of a quantum system fully characterize a basis state of the system, and can in principle be measured together.","image":"Atomic_orbitals_n123_m-eigenstates.png.webp","url":"Quantum_number"}
