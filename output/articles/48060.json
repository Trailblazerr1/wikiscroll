{"title":"Wave equation","summary":"The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of waves—as they occur in classical physics—such as mechanical waves (e.g. water waves, sound waves and seismic waves) or light waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics. Due to the fact that the second order wave equation describes the superposition of an incoming wave and an outgoing wave (i.e. rather a standing wave field) it is also called \"Two-way wave equation\" (in contrast, the 1st order One-way wave equation describes a single wave with predefined wave propagation direction and is much easier to solve due to the 1st order derivatives).","image":"Wave_equation_1D_fixed_endpoints.gif"}
