{"title":"Kuiper belt","summary":"The Kuiper belt (/ˈkaɪpər/)[1] is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune at 30 astronomical units (AU) to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.[2] It is similar to the asteroid belt, but is far larger—20 times as wide and 20–200 times as massive.[3][4] Like the asteroid belt, it consists mainly of small bodies or remnants from when the Solar System formed. While many asteroids are composed primarily of rock and metal, most Kuiper belt objects are composed largely of frozen volatiles (termed \"ices\"), such as methane, ammonia, and water. The Kuiper belt is home to three objects identified as dwarf planets by the IAU:  Pluto,[5] Haumea,[6] and Makemake.[7] Some of the Solar System's moons, such as Neptune's Triton and Saturn's Phoebe, may have originated in the region.[8][9]","image":"Kuiper_belt_plot_objects_of_outer_solar_system.png.webp"}
