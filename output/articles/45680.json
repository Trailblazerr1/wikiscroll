{"title":"Track gauge","summary":"In rail transport, track gauge (in the U.S., alternatively track gage) is the distance between the two rails of a railway track. All vehicles on a rail network must have wheelsets that are compatible with the track gauge. Since many different track gauges exist worldwide, gauge differences often present a barrier to wider operation on railway networks.","image":"Track_gauge.svg.png.webp"}
