{"title":"Bhagavan","summary":"Bhagavān (Sanskrit: भगवान्, Bhagavān; Pali: Bhagavā), also spelt as Bhagwan, (sometimes translated in English as \"Lord\") is an epithet within Indian religions used to denote figures of religious worship. In Hinduism it is used to signify a deity or Avatar , particularly for Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu in Vaishnavism and for Shiva in Shaivism in India.[1][2]  In Jainism the term refers to the Tirthankaras, particularly Mahavira and in Buddhism to the Buddha.[3] In many parts of India and South Asia, Bhagavān represents the abstract concept of a universal God to Hindus who are spiritual and religious but do not worship a specific deity.[1]","image":"Git_govind_large.jpg.webp","url":"Bhagavan"}
