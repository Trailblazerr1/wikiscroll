{"title":"Glomerulus (kidney)","summary":"The glomerulus (plural glomeruli) is a network of small blood vessels (capillaries) known as a tuft,  located at the beginning of a nephron in the kidney. Each of the two kidneys contains about one million nephrons. The tuft is structurally supported by the mesangium (the space between the blood vessels), composed of intraglomerular mesangial cells. The blood is filtered across the capillary walls of this tuft through the glomerular filtration barrier, which yields its filtrate of water and soluble substances to a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule. The filtrate then enters the renal tubule of the nephron.[1]","image":"Bowman's_capsule_and_glomerulus.svg.png.webp","url":"Glomerulus_(kidney)"}
