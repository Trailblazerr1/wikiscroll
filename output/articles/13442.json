{"title":"Dopamine receptor","summary":"Dopamine receptors are a class of G protein-coupled receptors that are prominent in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). Dopamine receptors activate different effectors through not only G-protein coupling, but also signaling through different protein (dopamine receptor-interacting proteins) interactions.[1] The neurotransmitter dopamine is the primary endogenous ligand for dopamine receptors.","image":"Dopamin_-_Dopamine.svg.png.webp","url":"Dopamine_receptor"}
