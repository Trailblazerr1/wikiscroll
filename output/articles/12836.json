{"title":"Diaeresis (diacritic)","summary":"The diaeresis[lower-alpha 1] (/daɪˈɛrəsɪs, -ˈɪər-/ dy-ERR-ə-sis, -⁠EER-;[1] also known as the trema) and the umlaut (/ˈʊmlaʊt/) are two different diacritical marks that (in modern usage) look alike. They both consist of two dots ¨ placed over a letter, usually a vowel; when that letter is an i or a j, the diacritic replaces the tittle: ï.[2] In computer systems, both forms have the same code point (binary code). Their appearance in print or on screen may vary between typefaces but rarely within the same typeface.","image":"DE_A3_km193.jpg.webp"}
