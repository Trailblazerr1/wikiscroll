{"title":"Manusmriti","summary":"The Manusmṛiti (Sanskrit: मनुस्मृति), also known as the Mānava-Dharmaśāstra or Laws of Manu, is believed to be the first ancient legal text and constitution among the many Dharmaśāstras of Hinduism.[1][2] In ancient India, often the sages used to put down their ideas on how the society should run on the Manuscripts. It is believed that the original form of Manusmriti was changed as many things written in the Manuscript contradict each other.[3] It was one of the first Sanskrit texts to be translated into English in 1776, by British philologist Sir William Jones,[3] and was used to construct the Hindu law code, for the East India Company administered enclaves.[4][5]","image":"Om_symbol.svg.png.webp"}
