{"title":"Shōnen manga","summary":"Shōnen manga (少年漫画), also romanized as shonen or shounen, are Japanese comics marketed towards young teens between the ages of 12 and 18. [1] The age group varies with individual readers and different magazines. The kanji character 少年 (shōnen) literally means \"boy\" or \"youth\", and the character 漫画 (manga) means \"comic\"; thus, the complete phrase means \"young person's comic\", or simply \"boys' comic\", with the female equivalent being shōjo manga. Shōnen manga is the most popular and best-selling form of manga.[2][3]","image":"Anime_eye.svg.png.webp","url":"Shōnen_manga"}
