{"title":"Antifa (United States)","summary":"Antifa (/ænˈtiːfə, ˈænti(ˌ)fə/) is a far-left,[1] anti-fascist and anti-racist political movement in the United States. As a highly decentralized array of autonomous groups, antifa uses both nonviolent and violent direct action to achieve its aims rather than policy reform.[2][3][4] Much of antifa political activism is nonviolent, involving poster and flyer campaigns, mutual aid, speeches, protest marches, and community organizing.[5][6][7] They also engage in protest tactics, seeking to combat fascists and racists such as neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other far-right extremists. Antifa's willingness to directly confront far-right activists (and in some cases, law enforcement) is a departure from other leftist opposition movements.[3] This confrontation sometimes involves digital activism, doxing, harassment, physical violence, and property damage against those they identify as belonging to the far right.[8]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp"}
