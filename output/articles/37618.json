{"title":"Repeater","summary":"In telecommunications, a repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to extend transmissions so that the signal can cover longer distances or be received on the other side of an obstruction.\nSome types of repeaters broadcast an identical signal, but alter its method of transmission, for example, on another frequency or baud rate.","image":"Repeater-schema.svg.png.webp"}
