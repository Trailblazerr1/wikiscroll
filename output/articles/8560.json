{"title":"Carbon neutrality","summary":"Carbon neutrality is a state of net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. This can be achieved by balancing emissions of carbon dioxide with its removal (often through carbon offsetting) or by eliminating emissions from society (the transition to the \"post-carbon economy\").[1] The term is used in the context of carbon dioxide-releasing processes associated with transportation, energy production, agriculture, and industry.","image":"They_did_it!_(23692333176).jpg.webp"}
