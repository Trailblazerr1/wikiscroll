{"title":"Aktiengesellschaft","summary":"Aktiengesellschaft (German pronunciation: [ˈaktsi̯ənɡəˌzɛlʃaft]; abbreviated AG, pronounced [aːˈgeː]) is a German word for a corporation limited by share ownership (i.e. one which is owned by its shareholders) whose shares may be traded on a stock market. The term is used in Germany, Austria, Switzerland (where it is equivalent to a société anonyme or a società per azioni), and South Tyrol[lower-alpha 1] for companies incorporated there. It is also used in Luxembourg (as Aktiëgesellschaft, pronounced [ˈɑktsjəɡəˌzælʃɑft]), although the equivalent French language term société anonyme is more common. In the United Kingdom, the equivalent term is \"PLC\" and in the United States while the terms \"incorporated\" or \"corporation\" are typically used, technically the more precise equivalent term is \"joint-stock company\"[1] (though note for the British term only a minority of public limited companies have their shares listed on stock exchanges).[2]","image":"Society.svg.png.webp","url":"Aktiengesellschaft"}
