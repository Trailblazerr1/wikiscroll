{"title":"Allah","summary":"Allah (/ˈælə, ˈɑːlə, əˈlɑː/;[1][2] Arabic: الله‎, romanized: Allāh, IPA: [ʔaɫ.ɫaːh] (listen)) is the common Arabic word for God. In the English language, the word generally refers to God in Islam.[3][4][5] The word is thought to be derived by contraction from al-ilāh, which means \"the god\", and is linguistically related to the Hebrew words El (Elohim), Elah and the Aramaic word  ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ (ʼAlâhâ) for God.[6][7]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
