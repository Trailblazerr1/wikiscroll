{"title":"Foreign policy of the Donald Trump administration","summary":"U.S. foreign policy during the presidency of Donald Trump (2017â€“2021) was noted for its unpredictability and reneging on prior international commitments,[1][2][3][4] upending diplomatic conventions, embracing political and economic brinkmanship with most adversaries, and straining relations with traditional allies. Trump's \"America First\" policy pursued nationalist foreign policy objectives and prioritized bilateral relations over multinational agreements.[5][6][1] As president, Trump described himself as a nationalist[7] while espousing isolationist, non-interventionist, and protectionist views;[8][9][10][11] he personally praised some populist, neo-nationalist, illiberal, and authoritarian governments, while antagonizing others, even as administration diplomats nominally continued to pursue pro-democracy ideals abroad.[12]","image":"Donald_Trump_official_portrait_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Foreign_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration"}
