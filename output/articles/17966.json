{"title":"Gertie the Dinosaur","summary":"Gertie the Dinosaur is a 1914 animated short film by American cartoonist and animator Winsor McCay.  It is the earliest animated film to feature a dinosaur.  McCay first used the film before live audiences as an interactive part of his vaudeville act; the frisky, childlike Gertie did tricks at the command of her master.   McCay's employer William Randolph Hearst curtailed McCay's vaudeville activities, so McCay added a live-action introductory sequence to the film for its theatrical release renamed Winsor McCay, the Famous Cartoonist, and Gertie.  McCay abandoned a sequel, Gertie on Tour (c.â€‰1921), after producing about a minute of footage.","image":"Gertie_the_Dinosaur_(retouched_frame).jpg.webp"}
