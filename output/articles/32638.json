{"title":"Ob (river)","summary":"The Ob (Russian: Обь, IPA: [opʲ]: Ob') is a major river in Russia. It is in western Siberia; and together with Irtysh forms the world's seventh-longest river system, at 5,410 kilometres (3,360 mi). It forms at the confluence of the Biya and Katun which have their origins in the Altai Mountains. It is the westernmost of the three great Siberian rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean (the other two being the Yenisei and the Lena). Its flow is north-westward, then northward then these directions are repeated over greater distance.","image":"March_evening._The_sun_fell_across_the_Ob_river.jpg.webp"}
