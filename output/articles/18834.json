{"title":"Great Zimbabwe","summary":"Great Zimbabwe is a medieval city in the south-eastern hills of Zimbabwe near Lake Mutirikwe and the town of Masvingo. It is thought to have been the capital of a great kingdom, although which kingdom is not certain,[1] during the country's Late Iron Age. Construction on the city began in the 9th century and continued until it was abandoned in the 15th century.[2][3] The edifices are believed to have been erected by the ancestral Shona.[4] The stone city spans an area of 7.22 square kilometres (2.79 square miles) which could have housed up to 18,000 people at its peak, giving it a population density of approximately 2,500 per square kilometre. It is recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.","image":"Conical_Tower_-_Great_Enclosure_III_(33736918448).jpg.webp"}
