{"title":"Amazon Echo","summary":"Amazon Echo, often shortened to Echo, is an American brand of smart speakers developed by Amazon. Echo devices connect to the voice-controlled intelligent personal assistant service Alexa, which will respond when a user says \"Alexa\". Users may change this wake word to \"Amazon\", \"Echo\", or \"Computer\".[1][2] The features of the device include voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, and playing audiobooks, in addition to providing weather, traffic and other real-time information. It can also control several smart devices, acting as a home automation hub. The smart speaker needs to use Wi-Fi to connect to the Internet as there is no Ethernet port.","image":"AmazonEchoLogo.png.webp","url":"Amazon_Echo"}
