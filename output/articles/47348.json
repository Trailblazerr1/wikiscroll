{"title":"Victim blaming","summary":"Victim blaming occurs when the victim of a crime or any wrongful act is held entirely or partially at fault for the harm that befell them.[1] The study of victimology seeks to mitigate the prejudice against victims, and the perception that victims are in any way responsible for the actions of offenders.[2] There is historical and current prejudice against the victims of domestic violence and sex crimes, such as the greater tendency to blame victims of rape than victims of robbery if victims and perpetrators knew each other prior to the commission of the crime.[3]","image":"Marcha_das_Vadias.jpg.webp"}
