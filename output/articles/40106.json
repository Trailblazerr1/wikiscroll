{"title":"Serine protease","summary":"Serine proteases (or serine endopeptidases) are enzymes that cleave peptide bonds in proteins.  Serine serves as the nucleophilic amino acid at the (enzyme's) active site.[1] \nThey are found ubiquitously in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Serine proteases fall into two broad categories based on their structure: chymotrypsin-like (trypsin-like) or subtilisin-like.[2]","image":"Chymotrypsin_enzyme.png.webp"}
