{"title":"United States district court","summary":"The United States district courts are the trial courts of the U.S. federal judiciary. There is a United States bankruptcy court associated with each U.S. district court. Each federal judicial district has at least one courthouse, and many districts have more than one. Most decisions of district courts may be appealed to the respective court of appeals of their circuit, with a small number instead being appealable to the Federal Circuit, or directly to the Supreme Court.","image":"US_Court_of_Appeals_and_District_Court_map.svg.png.webp"}
