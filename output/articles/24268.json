{"title":"Kabushiki gaisha","summary":"A kabushiki gaisha (Japanese: 株式会社, pronounced [kabɯɕi̥ki ɡaꜜiɕa]; literally \"share company\") or kabushiki kaisha, commonly abbreviated K.K., is a type of company (会社, kaisha) defined under the Companies Act of Japan.  The term is often translated as \"stock company\", \"joint-stock company\" or \"stock corporation\".[1] Similarly to how the word anime refers to all animation in Japanese usage but when used outside Japan refers to Japanese animation specifically, the term kabushiki gaisha in Japan refers to any joint-stock companies regardless of country of origin or incorporation, however outside Japan, the term refers specifically to joint-stock companies incorporated in Japan.","image":"Society.svg.png.webp","url":"Kabushiki_gaisha"}
