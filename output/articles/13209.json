{"title":"Divine command theory","summary":"Divine command theory (also known as theological voluntarism)[1][2] is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good is equivalent to whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by God's commands and that for a person to be moral he is to follow God's commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.","image":"Saint_Augustine_by_Philippe_de_Champaigne.jpg.webp","url":"Divine_command_theory"}
