{"title":"Parity (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, parity is the property of an integer of whether it is even or odd. An integer's parity is even if it is divisible by two with no remainders left and its parity is odd if it isn't; that is, its remainder is 1.[1] For example, −4, 0, 82, and 178 are even because there is no remainder when dividing it by 2. By contrast, −3, 5, 7, 21 are odd numbers as they leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.","image":"Parity_of_5_and_6_Cuisenaire_rods.png.webp"}
