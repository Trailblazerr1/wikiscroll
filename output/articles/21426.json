{"title":"iPod Touch","summary":"The iPod Touch (stylized and marketed as iPod touch) is a line of iOS-based mobile devices designed and marketed by Apple Inc. with a touchscreen-controlled user interface. As with other iPod models, it can be used as a music player and a handheld gaming device, but it can also be used as a digital camera, a web browser and for messaging.[7] It is similar in design to the iPhone, but it connects to the Internet only through Wi-Fi and does not use cellular network data, and so is not a smartphone.","image":"IPodtouchlogo.svg.png.webp","url":"IPod_Touch"}
