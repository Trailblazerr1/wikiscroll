{"title":"Slave states and free states","summary":"In the United States before 1865, a slave state was a state in which slavery and the slave trade were legal, while a free state was one in which they were not.  Between 1812 and 1850, it was considered by the slave states to be politically imperative that the number of free states not exceed the number of slave states, so new states were admitted in slaveâ€“free pairs. There were, nonetheless, some slaves in most free states up to the 1840 census, and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 specifically stated that a slave did not become free by entering a free state.","image":"US_Slave_Free_1789-1861.gif","url":"Slave_states_and_free_states"}
