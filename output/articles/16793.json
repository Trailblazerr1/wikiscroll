{"title":"Fraktur","summary":"Fraktur (German: [fʁakˈtuːɐ̯] (listen)) is a calligraphic hand of the Latin alphabet and any of several blackletter typefaces derived from this hand. The blackletter lines are broken up; that is, their forms contain many angles when compared to the curves of the Antiqua (common) typefaces modeled after antique Roman square capitals and Carolingian minuscule. From this, Fraktur is sometimes contrasted with the \"Latin alphabet\" in northern European texts, which is sometimes called the \"German alphabet\", simply being a typeface of the Latin alphabet. Similarly, the term \"Fraktur\" or \"Gothic\" is sometimes applied to all of the blackletter typefaces (known in German as Gebrochene Schrift, \"Broken Script\").","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
