{"title":"Metal","summary":"A metal (from Greek μέταλλον métallon, \"mine, quarry, metal\") is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). A metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride.","image":"Iron_electrolytic_and_1cm3_cube.jpg.webp"}
