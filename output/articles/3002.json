{"title":"Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II","summary":"During the last weeks of World War II, warships of the United States Navy, the Royal Navy and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded industrial and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments were conducted by battleships and cruisers, and caused heavy damage to several of the targeted factories, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese did not attempt to attack the Allied bombardment forces, and none of the involved warships suffered any damage.","image":"USS_Indiana_bombarding_Kamaishi_14_July_1945.jpg.webp","url":"Allied_naval_bombardments_of_Japan_during_World_War_II"}
