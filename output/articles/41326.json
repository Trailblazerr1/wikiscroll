{"title":"Something to Remember","summary":"Something to Remember is a compilation album by American singer Madonna, released by Maverick Records on November 3, 1995. The album was conceived after a controversial period in Madonna's career, when many critics had speculated that her career had declined. It compiles ballads spanning over a decade of her career, including a reworked version of \"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\" and three new songs: \"You'll See\", \"One More Chance\" and a cover of Marvin Gaye's \"I Want You\". The album also features previously released singles that had never been included on a Madonna album, \"I'll Remember\" and \"This Used to Be My Playground\", and altogether provided a softer image for the singer during a critical period in her career.","image":"Something_to_Remember_cover.png.webp"}
