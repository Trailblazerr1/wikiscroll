{"title":"Jötunn","summary":"In Norse mythology, a jötunn or, in the normalised scholarly spelling of Old Norse, jǫtunn (/ˈjɔːtʊn/;[1] Old Norse pronunciation: [ˈjɔtonː]; plural jötnar/jǫtnar [ˈjɔtnɑz̠]) is a type of entity contrasted with gods (Æsir and Vanir) and other non-human figures, such as dwarfs and elves. The entities are themselves ambiguously defined, variously referred to by several other terms, including risi, thurs and troll. The jötnar predominantly dwell in Jötunheimr; however, they are sometimes referred to as living in specific geographical locations such as Ægir on Læsø.[2]","image":"Kulturen_-_Riesin_Holdrykka.jpg.webp","url":"Jötunn"}
