{"title":"Sea surface temperature","summary":"Sea surface temperature (SST), or ocean surface temperature, is the water temperature close to the ocean's surface. The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between 1 millimetre (0.04 in) and 20 metres (70 ft) below the sea surface.  Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore.  Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass.  Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the Earth's oceans.  Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper 30 metres (100 ft) of the ocean.  SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days.  In addition, ocean currents such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), can effect SST's on multi-decadal time scales,[4] a major impact results from the global thermohaline circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans.","image":"Land_vs_Ocean_Temperature.svg.png.webp","url":"Sea_surface_temperature"}
