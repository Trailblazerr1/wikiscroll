Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that military commissions set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at Guantanamo Bay lack \"the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.\"[1]  Specifically, the ruling says that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions was violated.","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp"}
