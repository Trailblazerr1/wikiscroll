{"title":"Midrash","summary":"Midrash (/ˈmɪdrɑːʃ/;[1] Hebrew: מִדְרָשׁ‎; pl. מִדְרָשִׁים‎ midrashim) is biblical exegesis by ancient Judaic authorities,[2] using a mode of interpretation prominent in the Talmud. The word itself means \"textual interpretation\", or \"study\",[3] derived from the root verb darash (דָּרַשׁ‎), which means \"resort to, seek, seek with care, enquire, require\", forms of which appear frequently in the Hebrew Bible.","image":"Midrash_tehillim_title.jpg.webp","url":"Midrash"}
