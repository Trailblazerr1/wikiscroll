{"title":"Maximian","summary":"Maximian (Latin: Marcus Aurelius Valerius Maximianus; c. 250 – c. July 310), nicknamed Herculius,[8] was Roman emperor from 286 to 305. He was Caesar[3][4] from 285 to 286, then Augustus from 286[1] to 305.[2] He shared the latter title with his co-emperor and superior, Diocletian, whose political brain complemented Maximian's military brawn. Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign. In late 285, he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae. From 285 to 288, he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier. Together with Diocletian, he launched a scorched earth campaign deep into Alamannic territory in 288, temporarily relieving the Rhine provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion.","image":"MSR_-_Tête_de_l'empreur_Maximien_Hercule_-_Inv_34_b_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
