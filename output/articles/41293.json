{"title":"Solo diving","summary":"Solo diving is the practice of self-sufficient underwater diving without a \"dive buddy\", particularly with reference to scuba diving, but the term is also applied to freediving. Surface supplied diving and atmospheric suit diving are single diver underwater activities but are accompanied by an on-surface support team dedicated to the safety of the diver, and not considered solo diving in its truest sense.","image":"Peter_Southwood_2.jpg.webp"}
