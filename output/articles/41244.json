{"title":"Sola fide","summary":"Justificatio sola fide (or simply sola fide), meaning justification by faith alone, is a Christian theological doctrine commonly held to distinguish the Lutheran and Reformed traditions of Protestantism,[1] among others, from the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox churches.[2] The doctrine asserts that it is on the basis of faith that believers are made right of their transgressions of the law of God rather than on the basis of good works which they have done. This forgiveness is known as \"justification\". In classical Lutheran and Reformed theologies, good works are seen to be evidence of faith, but the good works themselves do not determine salvation.[3] In contrast, the Methodist doctrine affirms a belief in justification by faith that offers God's forgiveness, but holds that holy living with the goal of Christian perfection (sanctification) is essential for salvation.[3][4][5]","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp"}
