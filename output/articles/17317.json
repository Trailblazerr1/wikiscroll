{"title":"Galactic habitable zone","summary":"In astrobiology and planetary astrophysics, the galactic habitable zone is the region of a galaxy in which life might most likely develop. The concept of a galactic habitable zone analyzes various factors, such as metallicity (the presence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) and the rate and density of major catastrophes such as supernovae, and uses these to calculate which regions of a galaxy are more likely to form terrestrial planets, initially develop simple life, and provide a suitable environment for this life to evolve and advance.[1] According to research published in August 2015, very large galaxies may  favor the birth and development of habitable planets more than smaller galaxies such as the Milky Way.[2] In the case of the Milky Way, its galactic habitable zone is commonly believed to be an annulus (chubby ring) with an outer radius of about 10 kiloparsecs (33,000Â ly) and an inner radius close to the Galactic Center (with both radii lacking hard boundaries).[1][3]","image":"Starpop.svg.png.webp"}
