{"title":"Spanning Tree Protocol","summary":"The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that builds a loop-free logical topology for Ethernet networks. The basic function of STP is to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup links providing fault tolerance if an active link fails.","image":"Spanning_tree_protocol_at_work_5.svg.png.webp"}
