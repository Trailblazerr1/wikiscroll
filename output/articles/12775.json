{"title":"Development of the New Testament canon","summary":"The canon of the New Testament is the set of books many modern Christians regard as divinely inspired and constituting the New Testament of the Christian Bible. For historical Christians, canonization was based on whether the material was from authors socially approximate to the apostles and not based solely on divine inspiration – however, many modern scholars recognize that the New Testament texts were not written by apostles.[1] For most, it is an agreed-upon list of 27 books[2] that includes the canonical Gospels, Acts, letters attributed to various apostles, and Revelation, though there are many textual variations (for instance, John's Revelation is not considered canonical in Eastern and Middle Eastern traditions). The books of the canon of the New Testament were written before 120 AD.[2] In early Christian history, there was much inconsistency among the content of various historical canons, and it was not until hundreds of years later between the 3rd and 6th centuries during which canonical consistency became apparent, possibly influenced by the invention of the codex.","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp","url":"Development_of_the_New_Testament_canon"}
