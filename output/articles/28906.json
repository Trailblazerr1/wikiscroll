{"title":"Matrix metalloproteinase","summary":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), also known as matrix metallopeptidases or matrixins, are metalloproteinases that are calcium-dependent zinc-containing endopeptidases;[1] other family members are adamalysins, serralysins, and astacins. The MMPs belong to a larger family of proteases known as the metzincin superfamily.[2]","image":"Protein_MMP9_PDB_1itv.png.webp"}
