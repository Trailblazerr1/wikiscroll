{"title":"Prefectures of Japan","summary":"Japan is divided into 47 prefectures (都道府県, todōfuken, [todoːɸɯ̥ꜜkeɴ]), which rank immediately below the national government and form the country's first level of jurisdiction and administrative division. They include 43  prefectures proper (県, ken), two urban prefectures (府, fu: Osaka and Kyoto), one \"circuit\" or \"territory\" (道, dō: Hokkai-dō) and one metropolis (都, to: Tokyo). \nIn 1868, the Meiji Fuhanken sanchisei administration created the first prefectures (urban fu and rural ken) to replace the urban and rural administrators (bugyō, daikan, etc.) in the parts of the country previously controlled directly by the shogunate and a few territories of rebels/shogunate loyalists who had not submitted to the new government such as Aizu/Wakamatsu. In 1871, all remaining feudal domains (han) were also transformed into prefectures, so that prefectures subdivided the whole country. In several waves of territorial consolidation, today's 47 prefectures were formed by the turn of the century. In many instances, these are contiguous with the ancient ritsuryō provinces of Japan.[1]","image":"Regions_and_Prefectures_of_Japan_2.svg.png.webp"}
