{"title":"Tunicate","summary":"A tunicate is a marine invertebrate animal, a member of the subphylum Tunicata /tjuːnɪˈkeɪtə/. It is part of the Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords (including vertebrates). The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. They are the only chordates that have lost their myomeric segmentation, with the possible exception of the 'seriation of the gill slits'.[6][7]","image":"Tunicate_komodo.jpg.webp","url":"Tunicate"}
