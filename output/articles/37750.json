{"title":"Retrovirus","summary":"A retrovirus is a type of virus that inserts a copy of its RNA genome[lower-alpha 1] into the DNA of a host cell that it invades, thus changing the genome of that cell.[3] Once inside the host cell's cytoplasm, the virus uses its own reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome, the reverse of the usual pattern, thus retro (backwards). The new DNA is then incorporated into the host cell genome by an integrase enzyme, at which point the retroviral DNA is referred to as a provirus. The host cell then treats the viral DNA as part of its own genome, transcribing and translating the viral genes along with the cell's own genes, producing the proteins required to assemble new copies of the virus.","image":"Hiv_gross.png.webp","url":"Retrovirus"}
