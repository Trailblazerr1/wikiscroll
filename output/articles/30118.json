{"title":"Missing white woman syndrome","summary":"Missing white woman syndrome is a term used by social scientists[1][2][3] and media commentators to refer to the media coverage, especially in television,[4] of missing-person cases involving young, white, upper-middle-class women or girls compared to the alleged relative lack of attention towards missing women who are not white, women of lower social classes, and missing men or boys.[5][6] Although the term was coined in the context of missing-person cases, it is sometimes used of coverage of other violent crimes. The phenomenon has been highlighted in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and other predominantly white countries.[7][8]","image":"ProhibitionSign.svg.png.webp","url":"Missing_white_woman_syndrome"}
