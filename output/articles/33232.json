{"title":"Order of the Bath","summary":"The Most Honourable Order of the Bath[2] is a British order of chivalry founded by George I on 18 May 1725.[3] The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which involved bathing (as a symbol of purification) as one of its elements. The knights so created were known as \"Knights of the Bath\".[4] George I \"erected the Knights of the Bath into a regular Military Order\".[5] He did not (as is commonly believed) revive the Order of the Bath,[6] since it had never previously existed as an Order, in the sense of a body of knights who were governed by a set of statutes and whose numbers were replenished when vacancies occurred.[7][8]","image":"Order_of_bath_star.jpg.webp","url":"Order_of_the_Bath"}
