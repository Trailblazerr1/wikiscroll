{"title":"PAL region","summary":"The PAL region is a television publication territory that covers most of Asia, Africa, Europe, South America and Oceania. It is so named because of the PAL (Phase Alternating Line) television standard traditionally used in some of those regions, as opposed to the NTSC standard traditionally used in Japan and most of North America.","image":"PAL-NTSC-SECAM.svg.png.webp"}
