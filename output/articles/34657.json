{"title":"Petitcodiac River","summary":"The Petitcodiac River /pɛtiˈkoʊdi.æk/ (listen), known informally as the Chocolate River (French: Rivière Chocolat or Rivière au Chocolat), is a river in south-eastern New Brunswick, Canada. It is characterized by its brown mud floor and brown waters. The river has a meander length of 79 kilometres (49 miles) and is located in Westmorland, Albert, and Kings counties, draining a watershed area of about 2,071 square kilometres (800 sq mi). The watershed features valleys, ridges, and rolling hills, and is home to a diverse population of terrestrial and aquatic species. Ten named tributaries join the river in its course toward its mouth in Shepody Bay. Before the construction of a causeway in 1968, the river had one of the world's largest tidal bores, which ranged from 1 to 2 metres (3.3–6.6 ft) in height and moved at 5 to 13 kilometres per hour (3.1–8.1 mph).  With the opening of the causeway gates in April 2010, the river is flushing itself of ocean silts, and the bore is returning to its former size.","image":"PetitcodiacRiver_Coude.jpg.webp","url":"Petitcodiac_River"}
