{"title":"Planetary boundaries","summary":"Planetary boundaries is a concept involving Earth system processes that contain environmental boundaries. It was proposed in 2009 by a group of Earth system and environmental scientists, led by Johan Rockstr√∂m from the Stockholm Resilience Centre and Will Steffen from the Australian National University. The group wanted to define a \"safe operating space for humanity\" for the international community, including governments at all levels, international organizations, civil society, the scientific community and the private sector, as a precondition for sustainable development. The framework is based on scientific evidence that human actions since the Industrial Revolution have become the main driver of global environmental change.","image":"Planetary_Boundaries.png.webp"}
