{"title":"County","summary":"A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes[1] in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French conté or cunté denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount.[2] Literal equivalents in other languages, derived from the equivalent of \"count\", are now seldom used officially, including comté, contea, contado, comtat, condado, Grafschaft, graafschap, and zhupa in Slavic languages; terms equivalent to English language administrative terms such as municipality, district, circuit and commune/community are now often instead used.","image":"Estonia_municipalities.png.webp","url":"County"}
