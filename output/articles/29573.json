{"title":"Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England","summary":"Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties are one of the four levels of subdivisions of England used for the purposes of local government outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly. As originally constituted, the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties each consisted of multiple districts, had a county council and were also the counties for the purposes of Lieutenancies. Later changes in legislation during the 1980s and 1990s have resulted in counties with no county council and 'unitary authority' counties with no districts. Counties for the purposes of Lieutenancies are now defined separately, based on the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties.","image":"English_metropolitan_and_non-metropolitan_counties_by_type_2009.svg.png.webp","url":"Metropolitan_and_non-metropolitan_counties_of_England"}
