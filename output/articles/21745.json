{"title":"Inactivated vaccine","summary":"An inactivated vaccine (or killed vaccine) is a vaccine consisting of virus particles, bacteria, or other pathogens that have been grown in culture and then killed to destroy disease-producing capacity. In contrast, live vaccines use pathogens that are still alive (but are almost always attenuated, that is, weakened). Pathogens for inactivated vaccines are grown under controlled conditions and are killed as a means to reduce infectivity and thus prevent infection from the vaccine.[1]","image":"Soldiers_receiving_typhoid_vaccinations_(Reeve_036335)%2C_National_Museum_of_Health_and_Medicine_(5243638771).jpg.webp","url":"Inactivated_vaccine"}
