The song became one of Dylan's most popular and most covered post-1960s compositions, spawning covers from Guns N' Roses, Eric Clapton, Randy Crawford and more. Described by Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin as \"an exercise in splendid simplicity\",[1] the song features two short verses, the lyrics of which comment directly on the scene in the film for which it was written: the death of a frontier lawman (Slim Pickens) who refers to his wife (Katy Jurado) as \"Mama\".[2]","image":"Bob_Dylan_-_Knockin_on_Heavens_Door.jpg.webp"}
