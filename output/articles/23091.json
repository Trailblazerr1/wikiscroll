{"title":"Jascha Heifetz","summary":"Jascha Heifetz (/ˈhaɪfɪts/; February 2 [O.S. January 20] 1901 – December 10, 1987) was a Russian-American violinist.[1] Born in Vilna (Vilnius), he moved as a teenager to the United States, where his Carnegie Hall debut was rapturously received. He was a virtuoso since childhood—Fritz Kreisler, another leading violinist of the twentieth century, said on hearing Heifetz's debut, \"We might as well take our fiddles and break them across our knees.\"[2] He had a long and successful performing career. However, after an injury to his right (bowing) arm, he switched his focus to teaching.[3][4][5][6]","image":"Heifetz_LOC_38890u.jpg.webp","url":"Jascha_Heifetz"}
