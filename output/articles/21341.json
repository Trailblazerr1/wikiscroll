{"title":"Hysteria","summary":"Hysteria is a pejorative term used colloquially to mean ungovernable emotional excess and can refer to a temporary state of mind or emotion.[1] In the 19th century, hysteria was considered a diagnosable physical illness in women. It is assumed that the basis for diagnosis operated under the belief that women are predisposed to mental and behavioral conditions; an interpretation of sex-related differences in stress responses.[2] In the 20th century, it shifted to being considered a mental illness.[3] Many influential persons such as Sigmund Freud and Jean-Martin Charcot dedicated research to hysteria patients.[4] Currently, most doctors practicing medicine do not accept hysteria as a medical diagnosis.[5] The blanket diagnosis of hysteria has been fragmented into myriad medical categories such as epilepsy, histrionic personality disorder, conversion disorders, dissociative disorders, or other medical conditions.[5][6] Furthermore, lifestyle choices, such as deciding not to wed, are no longer considered symptoms of psychological disorders such as hysteria.[5]","image":"Drawings_of_a_woman_in_catalepsy_by_Albert_Londe.jpg.webp"}
