{"title":"Plan of Saint Gall","summary":"The Plan of Saint Gall is a medieval architectural drawing of a monastic compound dating from 820â€“830 AD.[1] It depicts an entire Benedictine monastic compound, including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and a special house for bloodletting. According to calculations based on the manuscript's tituli the complex was meant to house about 110 monks, 115 lay visitors, and 150 craftmen and agricultural workers.[2] The Plan was never actually built,[3] and was so named because it is dedicated to Gozbert abbot of Saint Gall. The planned church was intended to keep the relics of Saint Gall. The plan was kept at the famous medieval monastery library of the Abbey of St. Gall, the Stiftsbibliothek Sankt Gallen where it remains to this day (indexed as Codex Sangallensis 1092).","image":"Codex_Sangallensis_1092_recto.jpg.webp"}
