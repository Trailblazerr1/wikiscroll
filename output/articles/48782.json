{"title":"Witch-hunt","summary":"A witch-hunt, or a witch purge, is a search for people who have been labeled witches or a search for evidence of witchcraft. The classical period of witch-hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America took place in the Early Modern period or about 1450 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 executions.[lower-alpha 1][1] The last executions of people convicted as witches in Europe took place in the 18thÂ century. In other regions, like Africa and Asia, contemporary witch-hunts have been reported from sub-Saharan Africa and Papua New Guinea, and official legislation against witchcraft is still found in Saudi Arabia and Cameroon today.","image":"Wickiana5.jpg.webp","url":"Witch-hunt"}
