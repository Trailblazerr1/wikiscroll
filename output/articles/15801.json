{"title":"Far side of the Moon","summary":"The far side of the Moon is the lunar hemisphere that always faces away from Earth, opposite to the near side. Compared to the near side, the far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat and dark lunar maria (\"seas\"), giving it an appearance closer to other barren places in the solar system such as Mercury and Callisto. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South Pole–Aitken basin. The hemisphere is sometimes called the \"dark side of the Moon\", where \"dark\" means \"unknown\" instead of \"lacking sunlight\" – both sides of the Moon experience two weeks of sunlight while the opposite side experiences two weeks of night.[1][2][3][4]","image":"Back_side_of_the_Moon_AS16-3021.jpg.webp","url":"Far_side_of_the_Moon"}
