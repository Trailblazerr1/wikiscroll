{"title":"Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament","summary":"Two names and a variety of titles are used to refer to Jesus in the New Testament.[1] In Christianity, the two names Jesus and Emmanuel that refer to Jesus in the New Testament have salvific attributes.[2][3][4] After the crucifixion of Jesus the early Church did not simply repeat his messages, but focused on him, proclaimed him, and tried to understand and explain his message. One element of the process of understanding and proclaiming Jesus was the attribution of titles to him.[5] Some of the titles that were gradually used in the early Church and then appeared in the New Testament were adopted from the Jewish context of the age, while others were selected to refer to, and underscore the message, mission and teachings of Jesus.[5] In time, some of these titles gathered significant Christological significance.[6]","image":"Ut_in_nomine_Jesu_Gesu_Rome.jpg.webp","url":"Names_and_titles_of_Jesus_in_the_New_Testament"}
