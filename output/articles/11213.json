{"title":"Corn tortilla","summary":"In North America, a corn tortilla or just tortilla (/tɔːrˈtiːə/, Spanish: [toɾˈtiʝa]) is a type of thin, unleavened flatbread, made from hominy, that is the whole kernels of maize treated with alkali to improve their nutrition in a process called nixtamalization. A simple dough made of ground, dried hominy, salt and water is then formed into flat discs and cooked on a very hot surface, generally an iron griddle called a comal.","image":"Tortillas_de_maiz_blanco_(México)_01.jpg.webp","url":"Corn_tortilla"}
