{"title":"Advaita Vedanta","summary":"Advaita Vedānta (/ʌðˈvaɪtə vɛˈðɑːntə/; Sanskrit: अद्वैत वेदान्त, IAST: Advaita Vedānta) is a school of Hindu philosophy and \"spiritual experience.\"[1] The term Advaita (literally, \"non-duality\") refers to the idea that Brahman alone is ultimately real, while the transient phenomenal world is an illusory appearance (maya) of Brahman, and the true self, Ātman, is identical with Brahman.[2][3][4] In this view, jivanatman or individual self is a mere reflection of singular Ātman in a multitude of apparent individual bodies.[5]","image":"1_Om.svg.png.webp","url":"Advaita_Vedanta"}
