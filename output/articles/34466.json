{"title":"Perfusion","summary":"Perfusion is the passage of fluid through the circulatory system or lymphatic system to an organ or a tissue,[1] usually referring to the delivery of blood to a capillary bed in tissue. Perfusion is measured as the rate at which blood is delivered to tissue,[2] or volume of blood per unit time (blood flow) per unit tissue mass. The SI unit is m3/(sÂ·kg), although for human organs perfusion is typically reported in ml/min/g.[3] The word is derived from the French verb \"perfuser\" meaning to \"pour over or through\".[4] All animal tissues require an adequate blood supply for health and life. Poor perfusion (malperfusion), that is, ischemia, causes health problems, as seen in cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral artery disease, and many other conditions.","image":"Lindbergh_perfusion_pump_in_Putnam_Gallery%2C_2009-11-24.jpg.webp","url":"Perfusion"}
