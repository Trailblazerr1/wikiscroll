{"title":"Canine parvovirus","summary":"Canine parvovirus (also referred to as CPV, CPV2, or parvo) is a contagious virus mainly affecting dogs. CPV is highly contagious and is spread from dog to dog by direct or indirect contact with their feces. Vaccines can prevent this infection, but mortality can reach 91% in untreated cases. Treatment often involves veterinary hospitalization. Canine parvovirus often infects other mammals including foxes, wolves, cats, and skunks.[1] Felines are also susceptible to panleukopenia, a different strain of parvovirus.[2]","image":"Canines_Parvovirus.jpg.webp"}
