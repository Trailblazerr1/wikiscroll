{"title":"Atrial flutter","summary":"Atrial flutter (AFL) is a common abnormal heart rhythm that starts in the atrial chambers of the heart.[1]  When it first occurs, it is usually associated with a fast heart rate and is classified as a type of supraventricular tachycardia.[2] Atrial flutter is characterized by a sudden-onset (usually) regular abnormal heart rhythm on an electrocardiogram (ECG) in which the heart rate is fast. Symptoms may include a feeling of the heart beating too fast, too hard, or skipping beats, chest discomfort, difficulty breathing, a feeling as if one's stomach has dropped, a feeling of being light-headed, or loss of consciousness.","image":"Atrial_flutter34.svg.png.webp"}
