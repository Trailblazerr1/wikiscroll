{"title":"Toltec","summary":"The Toltec culture (/ˈtɒltɛk/) is a pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture that ruled a state centered in Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico in the early post-classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (ca. 900–1521 AD). The later Aztec culture saw the Toltecs as their intellectual and cultural predecessors and described Toltec culture emanating from Tōllān [ˈtoːlːaːn] (Nahuatl for Tula) as the epitome of civilization; in the Nahuatl language the word Tōltēcatl [toːlˈteːkat͡ɬ] (singular) or Tōltēcah [toːlˈteːkaʔ] (plural) came to take on the meaning \"artisan\".[1] The Aztec oral and pictographic tradition also described the history of a Toltec Empire, giving lists of rulers and their exploits.","image":"Toltec-style_Vessel_1.jpg.webp"}
