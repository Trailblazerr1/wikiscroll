Margaret was known as a wise, energetic and capable leader, who governed with \"farsighted tact and caution,\"[6] earning the nickname \"Semiramis of the North\".[7] She was derisively called \"King Breechless\", one of several derogatory nicknames invented by her rival Albert of Mecklenburg,[8][9] but was also known by her subjects as \"the Lady King\", which became widely used in recognition of her capabilities.[10][11][12][13] Knut Gjerset calls her \"the first great ruling queen in European history.\"[14]","image":"Margaret_of_Denmark%2C_Norway_%26_Sweden_(1389)_effigy_2010_(2).jpg.webp"}
