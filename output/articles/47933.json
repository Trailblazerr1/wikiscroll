{"title":"War on terror","summary":"The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), popularly known as the War on Terror, as well as the U.S. War on Terror, is the term that refers to an ongoing international military campaign launched by the United States government following the September 11 attacks.[30] The targets of the campaign are primarily extremist groups located throughout the Muslim world, with the most prominent groups being al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and their various franchise groups. The naming of the campaign uses a metaphor of war to refer to a variety of actions that do not constitute a specific war as traditionally defined. U.S. president George W. Bush first used the term \"war on terrorism\" on 16 September 2001,[31][32] and then \"war on terror\" a few days later in a formal speech to Congress.[33][34] In the latter speech, President Bush stated, \"Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.\"[34][35] The term was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with al-Qaeda. The term was immediately criticized by such people as Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and more nuanced terms subsequently came to be used by the Bush administration to publicly define the international campaign led by the U.S.[30] While it was never used as a formal designation of U.S. operations in internal government documentation,[36] a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal was issued.","image":"War_on_Terror_montage1.png.webp"}
