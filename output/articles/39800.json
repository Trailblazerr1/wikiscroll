{"title":"Seamount","summary":"A seamount is a large geologic landform that rises from the ocean floor but that does not reach to the water's surface (sea level), and thus is not an island, islet or cliff-rock. Seamounts are typically formed from extinct volcanoes that rise abruptly and are usually found rising from the seafloor to 1,000–4,000 m (3,300–13,100 ft) in height. They are defined by oceanographers as independent features that rise to at least 1,000 m (3,281 ft) above the seafloor, characteristically of conical form.[1] The peaks are often found hundreds to thousands of meters below the surface, and are therefore considered to be within the deep sea.[2] During their evolution over geologic time, the largest seamounts may reach the sea surface where wave action erodes the summit to form a flat surface.  After they have subsided and sunk below the sea surface such flat-top seamounts are called \"guyots\" or \"tablemounts\".[1]","image":"SeamontDavidson_expedition_bathymetric-2002.jpg.webp","url":"Seamount"}
