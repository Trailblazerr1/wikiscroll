{"title":"Adolf Hitler's rise to power","summary":"Adolf Hitler's rise to power began in Germany in September 1919 when Hitler joined the political party then known as the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei – DAP (German Workers' Party). The name was changed in 1920 to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei – NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazi Party). It was anti-Marxist and opposed to the democratic post-war government of the Weimar Republic and the Treaty of Versailles, advocating extreme nationalism and Pan-Germanism as well as virulent antisemitism. Hitler attained power in March 1933 after the Reichstag adopted the Enabling Act of 1933, granting him expanded authority. President Paul von Hindenburg had already appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 after a series of parliamentary elections and associated backroom intrigues. The Enabling Act – when used ruthlessly and with authority – virtually assured that Hitler could thereafter constitutionally exercise dictatorial power without legal objection.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-14080%2C_Berlin%2C_Hitler%2C_Göring_und_Hanfstaengl.jpg.webp"}
