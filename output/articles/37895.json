{"title":"Richard Rorty","summary":"Richard McKay Rorty (October 4, 1931 â€“ June 8, 2007) was an American philosopher. Educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University, he had strong interests and training in both the history of philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy, the latter of which came to constitute the main focus of his work at Princeton University in the 1960s.[4]  He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a \"mirror of nature\") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation.","image":"Rorty.jpg.webp"}
