{"title":"Nissan Sentra","summary":"The Nissan Sentra is a series of automobiles manufactured by Nissan since 1982. Previously subcompact in classification, for model year 2000 it was reclassified as a compact car. Until 2006, Sentra was a rebadged export version of the Japanese Nissan Sunny, but since the 2013 model year, Sentra is a rebadged export version of the Sylphy. The Sentra nameplate is not used in Japan. Many other countries in South America sell their versions of the Sunny as the Sentra. In Mexico, the first three generations of the Sentra were known as the Nissan Tsuru (Japanese for crane), and the B13 model was sold under that name until 2017, alongside the updated models badged as Sentra.","image":"2020_Nissan_Sentra_SV%2C_front_10.22.20.jpg.webp"}
