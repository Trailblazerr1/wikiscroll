He lived much of his boyhood and the last fifteen years of life in Cooperstown, New York, which was founded by his father William Cooper on property that he owned. Cooper became a member of the Episcopal Church shortly before his death and contributed generously to it.[1] He attended Yale University for three years, where he was a member of the Linonian Society.[2]","image":"James_Fenimore_Cooper_by_Brady.jpg.webp","url":"James_Fenimore_Cooper"}
