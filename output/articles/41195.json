{"title":"Sodium channel","summary":"Sodium channels are integral membrane proteins that form ion channels, conducting sodium ions (Na+) through a cell's plasma membrane.[1][2] They belong to the superfamily of cation channels and can be classified according to the trigger that opens the channel for such ions, i.e. either a voltage-change (\"voltage-gated\", \"voltage-sensitive\", or \"voltage-dependent\" sodium channel; also called \"VGSCs\" or \"Nav channel\") or a binding of a substance (a ligand) to the channel (ligand-gated sodium channels).","image":"Sodium-channel.svg.png.webp"}
