{"title":"Axiom of choice","summary":"In mathematics, the axiom of choice, or AC, is an axiom of set theory equivalent to the statement that a Cartesian product of a collection of non-empty sets is non-empty. Informally put, the axiom of choice says that given any collection of bins, each containing at least one object, it is possible to make a selection of exactly one object from each bin, even if the collection is infinite. Formally, it states that for every indexed family \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          S\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            i\n            ∈\n            I\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (S_{i})_{i\\in I}}\n  \n of nonempty sets there exists an indexed family \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          )\n          \n            i\n            ∈\n            I\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x_{i})_{i\\in I}}\n  \n of elements such that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        ∈\n        \n          S\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x_{i}\\in S_{i}}\n  \n for every \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        ∈\n        I\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i\\in I}\n  \n.  The axiom of choice was formulated in 1904 by Ernst Zermelo in order to formalize his proof of the well-ordering theorem.[1]","image":"678af8cfde54ae12ee7322dcac4b969eae1b021a.svg"}
