{"title":"Reward system","summary":"The reward system (the mesocorticolimbic circuit) is a group of neural structures responsible for incentive salience (i.e., \"wanting\"; desire or craving for a reward and motivation), associative learning (primarily positive reinforcement and classical conditioning), and positively-valenced emotions, particularly ones involving pleasure as a core component (e.g., joy, euphoria and ecstasy).[1][2] Reward is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior, also known as approach behavior, and consummatory behavior.[1] A rewarding stimulus has been described as \"any stimulus, object, event, activity, or situation that has the potential to make us approach and consume it is by definition a reward\".[1] In operant conditioning, rewarding stimuli function as positive reinforcers;[3] however, the converse statement also holds true: positive reinforcers are rewarding.[3]","image":"Woman_drinking_water.jpg.webp","url":"Reward_system"}
