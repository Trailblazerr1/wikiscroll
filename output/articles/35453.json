{"title":"Polymorphism (biology)","summary":"In biology, polymorphism[1] is the occurrence of two or more clearly different morphs or forms, also referred to as alternative phenotypes, in the population of a species. To be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a panmictic population (one with random mating).[2]","image":"Jaguar_head_shot.jpg.webp","url":"Polymorphism_(biology)"}
