{"title":"Church of Scientology","summary":"The Church of Scientology is a group of interconnected corporate entities and other organizations devoted to the practice, administration and dissemination of Scientology, which is variously defined as a cult, a business or a new religious movement.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The movement has been the subject of a number of controversies, and the Church of Scientology has been described by government inquiries, international parliamentary bodies, scholars, law lords, and numerous superior court judgements as both a cult and a manipulative profit-making business.[12] In 1979, several executives of the Church were convicted and imprisoned for multiple offenses by a U.S. Federal Court.[13][14] The Church itself was convicted of fraud by a French court in 2009, a decision upheld by the supreme Court of Cassation in 2013.[15] The German government classifies Scientology as an anti-constitutional sect.[16][17] In France, it has been classified as a dangerous cult.[18][19] In some countries, it has managed to attain legal recognition as a religion.[20]","image":"Church_of_Scientology_building_in_Los_Angeles%2C_Fountain_Avenue.jpg.webp"}
