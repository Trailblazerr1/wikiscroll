{"title":"Naypyidaw","summary":"Naypyidaw, officially spelled Nay Pyi Taw (Burmese: နေပြည်တော်; MLCTS: Nepranytau; pronounced [nèpjìdɔ̀] lit. 'Royal Capital'), is the capital and third-largest city of Myanmar. The city is located at the centre of the Naypyidaw Union Territory.[1] It is unusual among Myanmar's cities, as it is an entirely planned city outside of any state or region. The city, then known only as Pyinmana District, officially replaced Yangon as the administrative capital of Myanmar on 6 November 2005; its official name was revealed to the public on Armed Forces Day, 27 March 2006.[5]","image":"Nay_Pyi_Daw_montage_2020.png.webp","url":"Naypyidaw"}
