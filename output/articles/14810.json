{"title":"Endosymbiont","summary":"An endosymbiont or endobiont[1] is any organism that lives within the body or cells of another organism most often, though not always, in a mutualistic relationship. (The term endosymbiosis is from the Greek: ἔνδον endon \"within\", σύν syn \"together\" and βίωσις biosis \"living\".) Examples are nitrogen-fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), which live in the root nodules of legumes; single-cell algae inside reef-building corals, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10–15% of insects.[2][3]","image":"Endosymbiosis.PNG.webp","url":"Endosymbiont"}
