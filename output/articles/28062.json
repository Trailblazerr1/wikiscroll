{"title":"Mahākāśyapa","summary":"Mahā Kāśyapa or Mahākāśyapa (Pali: Mahākassapa) was one of the principal disciples of Gautama Buddha.[2] He is regarded in Buddhism as an enlightened disciple, being foremost in ascetic practice. Mahākāśyapa assumed leadership of the monastic community following the paranirvāṇa (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the First Buddhist Council. He was considered to be the first patriarch in a number of early Buddhist schools and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the Chan and Zen traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of Maitreya, the future Buddha[3]—he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".[4]","image":"Mahākāśyapa_meets_an_Ājīvika_and_learns_of_the_parinirvana%2C_Gandhara_sculpture.jpg.webp"}
