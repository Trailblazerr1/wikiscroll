{"title":"Platelet","summary":"Platelets, also called thrombocytes (from Greek θρόμβος, \"clot\" and κύτος, \"cell\"), are a component of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is to react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, thereby initiating a blood clot.[1] Platelets have no cell nucleus; they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes[2] of the bone marrow or lung,[3] which then enter the circulation. Circulating inactivated platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped) structures,[4][5]: 117–18   2–3 µm in greatest diameter.[6] Activated platelets have cell membrane projections  covering their surface. Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other vertebrates (e.g. birds, amphibians), thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells.[5]: 3","image":"Platelet_Response_Animation.gif"}
