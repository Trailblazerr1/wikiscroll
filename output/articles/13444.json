{"title":"Doping (semiconductor)","summary":"In semiconductor production, doping is the  intentional introduction of impurities into an intrinsic semiconductor for the purpose of modulating its electrical, optical and structural properties. The doped material is referred to as an extrinsic semiconductor. A semiconductor doped to such high levels that it acts more like a conductor than a semiconductor is referred to as a degenerate semiconductor.","image":"45c5aa7cb096cb9e625f3436ba3d92c15b5fd103.svg"}
