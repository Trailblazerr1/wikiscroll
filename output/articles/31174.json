{"title":"Nail (anatomy)","summary":"A nail is a claw-like plate at the tip of the fingers and toes in most primates. Nails correspond to claws found in other animals. Fingernails and toenails are made of a tough protective protein called alpha-keratin, which is a polymer. Alpha-keratin is found in the hooves, claws and horns of vertebrates.[1]","image":"Blausen_0406_FingerNailAnatomy.png.webp"}
