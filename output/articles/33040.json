{"title":"Onychophora","summary":"Onychophora /ɒnɪˈkɒfərə/ (from Ancient Greek ονυχής, onyches, \"claws\"; and φέρειν, pherein, \"to carry\"), commonly known as velvet worms (due to their velvety texture and somewhat wormlike appearance) or more ambiguously as peripatus /pəˈrɪpətəs/ (after the first described genus, Peripatus), is a phylum of elongate, soft-bodied, many-legged panarthropods.[1][2] In appearance they have variously been compared to worms with legs, caterpillars, and slugs.[3] They prey upon smaller animals such as insects, which they catch by squirting an adhesive slime.","image":"Velvet_worm.jpg.webp","url":"Onychophora"}
