{"title":"List of peninsulas","summary":"A peninsula (Latin: paeninsula from paene \"almost\" and insula \"island\") is a piece of land that is bordered mostly by water but connected to mainland.[1][2][3][4] The surrounding water is usually understood to be continuous, though not necessarily named as such. A peninsula can also be a headland, cape, island promontory, bill, point,\nor spit.[5] A point is generally considered a tapering piece of land projecting into a body of water that is less prominent than a cape.[6] In English, the plural of peninsula is peninsulas or, less commonly, peninsulae. A river which courses through a very tight meander is also sometimes said to form a \"peninsula\" within the (almost closed) loop of water.","image":"Maury_Geography_101A_Europe_relief.jpg.webp"}
