{"title":"Foraminifera","summary":"Foraminifera (/fəˌræməˈnɪfərə/; Latin for \"hole bearers\"; informally called \"forams\") are single-celled organisms, members of a phylum or class of amoeboid protists characterized by streaming granular ectoplasm for catching food and other uses; and commonly an external shell (called a \"test\") of diverse forms and materials. Tests of chitin (found in some simple genera, and Textularia in particular) are believed to be the most primitive type. Most foraminifera are marine, the majority of which live on or within the seafloor sediment (i.e., are benthic),[2] while a smaller number float in the water column at various depths (i.e., are planktonic), which belong to the suborder Globigerinina.[3] Fewer are known from freshwater[4] or brackish[5] conditions, and some very few (nonaquatic) soil species have been identified through molecular analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA.[6][7]","image":"Ammonia_tepida.jpg.webp","url":"Foraminifera"}
