{"title":"Microglia","summary":"Microglia are a type of neuroglia (glial cell) located throughout the brain and spinal cord.[1] Microglia account for 10–15% of all cells found within the brain.[2] As the resident macrophage cells, they act as the first and main form of active immune defense in the central nervous system (CNS).[3] Microglia (and other neuroglia including astrocytes) are distributed in large non-overlapping regions throughout the CNS.[4][5] Microglia are key cells in overall brain maintenance—they are constantly scavenging the CNS for plaques, damaged or unnecessary neurons and synapses, and infectious agents.[6] Since these processes must be efficient to prevent potentially fatal damage, microglia are extremely sensitive to even small pathological changes in the CNS.[7] This sensitivity is achieved in part by the presence of unique potassium channels that respond to even small changes in extracellular potassium.[6] Recent evidence shows that microglia are also key players in the sustainment of normal brain functions under healthy conditions.[8] Microglia also constantly monitor neuronal functions through direct somatic contacts and exert neuroprotective effects when needed.[9]","image":"Mikroglej_1.jpg.webp","url":"Microglia"}
