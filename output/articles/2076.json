{"title":"Act (drama)","summary":"An act is a major division of a theatre work, including a play, film, opera, or musical theatre, consisting of one or more scenes.[1][2] The term can either refer to a conscious division placed within a work by a playwright (usually itself made up of multiple scenes)[3] or a unit of analysis for dividing a dramatic work into sequences. As applied, those definitions may or may not align. The word act can also be used for major sections of other entertainment, such as variety shows, television programs, music hall performances, cabaret, and literature.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Act_(drama)"}
