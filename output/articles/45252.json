{"title":"Tin Pan Alley","summary":"Tin Pan Alley is the name given to a collection of New York City music publishers and songwriters who dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. It originally referred to a specific place: West 28th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Flower District[2] of Manhattan; a plaque (see below) on the sidewalk on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth commemorates it.[3][4][5][6] In 2019, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission took up the question of preserving five buildings on the north side of the street as a Tin Pan Alley Historic District.[7] The agency designated five buildings (47â€“55 West 28th Street) individual landmarks on December 10, 2019, after a concerted effort by the \"Save Tin Pan Alley\" initiative of the 29th Street Neighborhood Association.[8]  Following successful protection of these Tin Pan Alley landmarks, project director George Calderaro and other proponents formed the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project to continue and commemorate the legacy of Tin Pan Alley with various advocacy and educational activities.","image":"Tinpanalley.jpg.webp"}
