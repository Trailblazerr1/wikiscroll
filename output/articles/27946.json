{"title":"Madonna filmography","summary":"Madonna has worked in twenty-seven feature films (twenty-two as an actress), ten short films, three theatrical plays, ten television episodes, and appeared in sixteen commercials. In 1979, she made her acting debut in the low-budget feature A Certain Sacrifice. Its commercial release in 1985 coincided with the success of her second studio album, Like a Virgin.[1] That same year, she made a cameo appearance as a club singer in the film Vision Quest; she also garnered commercial and critical success for the title role in Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan.[2][3] Madonna followed it with a leading role in the adventure drama Shanghai Surprise (1986), with her then-husband, actor Sean Penn. The film was panned by critics, and Madonna received her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.[4] Her next films such as Who's That Girl (1987) and Bloodhounds of Broadway (1989) were critical and commercial failures.[5][6] In 1986, she made her theatrical debut in David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom and her first commercial for Mitsubishi in Japan.[7][8] She starred in the 1989 commercial for Pepsi-Cola alongside her song \"Like a Prayer\". Due to the controversy surrounding the song's music video, the commercial was revoked and her contract with Pepsi-Cola was cancelled.[9]","image":"Madonna_en_Chelsea.jpg.webp"}
