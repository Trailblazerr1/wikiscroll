{"title":"Crystallography","summary":"Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids (see crystal structure). The word \"crystallography\" is derived from the Greek words crystallon \"cold drop, frozen drop\", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and graphein \"to write\".  In July 2012, the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography.[1]","image":"Stohrem.jpg.webp","url":"Crystallography"}
