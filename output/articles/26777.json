{"title":"List of civil parishes in Somerset","summary":"The ceremonial county of Somerset, England is divided into 418 areas known as civil parishes, which are lowest unit of local government in England. Parishes arose from Church of England divisions, and were given their current powers and responsibilities by the Local Government Act 1894.[1] The Local Government Act 1972 retained civil parishes in rural areas. Many former urban districts and municipal boroughs were replaced by new successor parishes; urban areas that were considered too large to be single parishes became unparished areas.[2]","image":"Somerset_numbered_districts.svg.png.webp"}
