{"title":"Classical field theory","summary":"A classical field theory is a physical theory that predicts how one or more physical fields interact with matter through field equations, without considering effects of quantization; theories that incorporate quantum mechanics are called quantum field theories. In most contexts, 'classical field theory' is specifically meant to describe electromagnetism and gravitation, two of the fundamental forces of nature.","image":"24e6e7fa277945002d4571dd95399c35756e8951.svg"}
