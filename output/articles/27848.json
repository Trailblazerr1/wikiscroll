{"title":"Macaque","summary":"The macaques (/məˈkɑːk/ or /məˈkæk/)[2] constitute a genus (Macaca) of gregarious Old World monkeys of the subfamily Cercopithecinae. The 23 species of macaques inhabit ranges throughout Asia, North Africa, and (in one instance) Gibraltar. Macaques are principally frugivorous (preferring fruit), although their diet also includes seeds, leaves, flowers, and tree bark. Some species, such as the crab-eating macaque, subsist on a diet of invertebrates and occasionally small vertebrates. On average, southern pig-tailed macaques in Malaysia eat about 70 large rats each per year.[3][4] All macaque social groups are matriarchal, arranged around dominant females.[5]","image":"Bonnet_macaque_(Macaca_radiata)_Photograph_By_Shantanu_Kuveskar.jpg.webp","url":"Macaque"}
