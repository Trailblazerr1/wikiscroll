{"title":"Ford Mustang (fourth generation)","summary":"The fourth generation Ford Mustang is an automobile that was produced by the American manufacturer Ford for the 1994 through 2004 model years. For 1994 the Ford Mustang underwent its first major redesign in fifteen years, being introduced in November 1993 and launching on December 9, 1993.[5] The design, code named \"SN-95\" by Ford, was based on an updated version of the Fox platform, the final Ford vehicle underpinned with this platform. It featured styling by Bud Magaldi that incorporated some stylistic elements from the classic Mustangs.[6] A convertible returned, but the previous notchback and hatchback bodystyles were discontinued in favor of a single fastback coupe bodystyle.","image":"94-98_Ford_Mustang_coupe.jpg.webp"}
