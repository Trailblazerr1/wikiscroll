{"title":"Alexander Scriabin","summary":"Alexander Nikolayevich Scriabin[1] (/skriˈɑːbɪn/;[2] Russian: Александр Николаевич Скрябин [ɐlʲɪˈksandr nʲɪkəˈɫaɪvʲɪtɕ ˈskrʲæbʲɪn]; 6 January 1872 [O.S. 25 December 1871] – 27 April [O.S. 14 April] 1915)[3] was a Russian composer and pianist. In his early years he was greatly influenced by the music of Frédéric Chopin,[4] and wrote works in a relatively tonal, late Romantic idiom. Later, and independently of his highly influential contemporary, Arnold Schoenberg, Scriabin developed a substantially atonal and much more dissonant musical language, which accorded with his personal brand of metaphysics. Scriabin was influenced by synesthesia, and associated colours with the various harmonic tones of his atonal scale, while his colour-coded circle of fifths was also influenced by theosophy. He is considered by some to be the main Russian Symbolist composer.","image":"Skrjabin_Alexander.jpg.webp"}
