{"title":"List of NCAA Division I men's basketball champions","summary":"The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Men's Basketball Tournament is a single-elimination tournament for men's college basketball teams in the United States. It determines the champion of Division I, the top level of play in the NCAA,[1] and the media often describes the winner as the national champion of college basketball.[2][3] The NCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, except for 2020, when it was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.[4] Its field grew from eight teams in the beginning to sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-eight teams take part in the tournament.[5][6] Teams can gain invitations by winning a conference championship or receiving an at-large bid from a 10-person committee.[7] The semifinals of the tournament are known as the Final Four and are held in a different city each year, along with the championship game;[8] Indianapolis, the city where the NCAA is based, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040.[9] Each winning university receives a rectangular, gold-plated trophy made of wood.[10]","image":"NCAA_titles.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_champions"}
