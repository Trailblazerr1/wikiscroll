{"title":"School discipline","summary":"School discipline relates to the actions taken by a teacher or the school organization towards a student (or group of students) when the student's behavior disrupts the ongoing educational activity or breaks a rule created by the school. Discipline can guide the children's behavior or set limits to help them learn to take better care of themselves, other people and the world around them.[1]","image":"Harper's_Weekly_8-27-98_cover.JPG.webp"}
