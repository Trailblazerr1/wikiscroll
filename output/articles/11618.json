{"title":"Crème brûlée","summary":"Crème brûlée or crème brulée (/ˌkrɛm bruːˈleɪ/; French pronunciation: ​[kʁɛm bʁy.le]), also known as burned cream, burnt cream or Trinity cream,[1] and virtually identical to the original crema catalana,[2] is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar. It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. The custard base is traditionally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes garnished with fruit.","image":"2014_0531_Crème_brûlée_Doi_Mae_Salong.jpg.webp","url":"Crème_brûlée"}
