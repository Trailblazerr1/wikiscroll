{"title":"White","summary":"White is the lightest color and is achromatic (having no hue). It is the color of snow, chalk, and milk, and is the opposite of black. White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light.  White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red, blue, and green light. The color white can be given with white pigments, especially titanium dioxide.[1]","image":"Delphinapterus_leucas_2.jpg.webp","url":"White"}
