{"title":"Snapchat","summary":"Snapchat is an American multimedia instant messaging app and service developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc. One of the principal features of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are usually only available for a short time before they become inaccessible to their recipients. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring users' \"Stories\" of 24 hours of chronological content, along with \"Discover,\" letting brands show ad-supported short-form content. It also allows users to keep photos in the \"my eyes only\" which lets them keep their photos in a password-protected space. It has also reportedly incorporated limited use of end-to-end encryption, with plans to broaden its use in the future.","image":"Snapchat_logo.svg.png.webp"}
