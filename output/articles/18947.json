{"title":"Greenwich Mean Time","summary":"Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London, counted from midnight. At different times in the past, it has been calculated in different ways, including being calculated from noon;[1] as a consequence, it cannot be used to specify a particular time unless a context is given. The term 'GMT' is also used as one of the names for the time zone UTC+00:00 and,[2] in UK law, is the basis for civil time in the United Kingdom.[3][lower-alpha 1]","image":"Time_zones_of_Europe.svg.png.webp","url":"Greenwich_Mean_Time"}
