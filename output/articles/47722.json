{"title":"Voltage regulator","summary":"A voltage regulator is  a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage. A voltage regulator may use a simple feed-forward design or may include  negative feedback. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.","image":"7812_voltage_regulator.jpg.webp"}
