{"title":"Western canon","summary":"The Western canon is the body of high culture literature, music, philosophy, and works of art that is highly valued in the West: works that have achieved the status of classics. However, not all these works originate in the Western world, and such works are also valued throughout the world. It is \"a certain Western intellectual tradition that goes from, say, Socrates to Wittgenstein in philosophy, and from Homer to James Joyce in literature\".[2] The word 'canon' is derived from Ancient Greek: κανών (kanṓn), meaning a measuring rod, or standard. The Bible, a product of ancient Jewish culture, from the Levant, in Western Asia, has been a major force in shaping Western culture, and \"has inspired some of the great monuments of human thought, literature, and art\".[3]","image":"Parnaso_09.jpg.webp","url":"Western_canon"}
