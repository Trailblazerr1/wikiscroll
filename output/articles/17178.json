{"title":"Funafuti","summary":"Funafuti is an atoll and the capital of the island nation of Tuvalu.[1][2] It has a population of 6,320 people (2017 census),[3] making it the country's most populous atoll, with 60.15 per cent of Tuvalu's population. It consists of a narrow sweep of land between 20 and 400 metres (66 and 1,312 feet) wide, encircling a large lagoon (Te Namo) 18 km (11 miles) long and 14 km (9 miles) wide. The average depth of the Funafuti lagoon is about 20 fathoms (36.5 metres or 120 feet).[4] With a surface area of 275 square kilometres (106.2 sq mi), it is by far the largest lagoon in Tuvalu. The land area of the 33 islets around the atoll of Funafuti totals 2.4 square kilometres (0.9 sq mi); taken together, they constitute less than one per cent of the total area of the atoll. Cargo ships can enter Funafuti's lagoon and dock at the port facilities on Fongafale.","image":"Maneapa_and_airport_in_Funafuti_atoll%2C_Tuvalu.jpg.webp","url":"Funafuti"}
