{"title":"Empanada","summary":"An empanada is a dish of Spanish cuisine, a type of baked or fried turnover consisting of pastry and filling, common in Spanish, other Southern European, Latin American, and the Philippine cultures. The name comes from the Galician verb empanar, and translates as \"enbreaded\", that is, wrapped or coated in bread.  They are made by folding dough over a filling, which may consist of meat, cheese, tomato, corn, or other ingredients, and then cooking the resulting turnover, either by baking or frying.","image":"Tapa_de_empanadillitas.JPG.webp"}
