{"title":"Geodesic","summary":"In geometry, a geodesic (/ˌdʒiːəˈdɛsɪk, ˌdʒiːoʊ-, -ˈdiː-, -zɪk/[1][2]) is commonly a curve representing in some sense the shortest[lower-alpha 1] path (arc) between two points in a surface, or more generally in a Riemannian manifold. The term also has meaning in any  differentiable manifold with a connection. It is a generalization of the notion of a \"straight line\" to a more general setting.","image":"cae66039269f72a16ad4cf708b56b7f45d67d9cf.svg","url":"Geodesic"}
