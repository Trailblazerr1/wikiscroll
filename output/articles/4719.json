{"title":"Asthenosphere","summary":"The asthenosphere (Ancient Greek: ἀσθενός [asthenos] meaning \"without strength\" and σφαίρα [sphaira] meaning \"sphere\") is the highly viscous, mechanically weak,[1] and ductile region of the upper mantle of Earth. It lies below the lithosphere, between approximately 80 and 200 km (50 and 120 miles) below the surface. The lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary is usually referred to as the LAB.[2][3] The asthenosphere is almost solid, although some of its regions are molten (e.g., below mid-ocean ridges). The lower boundary of the asthenosphere within the mantle is not well defined. The thickness of the asthenosphere depends mainly on temperature. However, the rheology of the asthenosphere also depends on the rate of deformation,[4][5] which suggests that the asthenosphere could be also formed as a result of a high rate of deformation. In some regions, the asthenosphere could extend as deep as 700 km (430 mi). It is considered the source of mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB).[6]","image":"Subduction-en.svg.png.webp"}
