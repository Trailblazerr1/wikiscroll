{"title":"Operation Uranus","summary":"Operation Uranus (Russian: Опера́ция «Ура́н», romanised: Operatsiya \"Uran\") was the codename of the Soviet Red Army's 19–23 November 1942 strategic operation on the  Eastern Front of World War II which led to the encirclement of  Axis forces in the vicinity of Stalingrad: the German Sixth Army, the Third and Fourth Romanian armies, and portions of the German  Fourth Panzer Army. The Red Army carried out the operation at roughly the midpoint of the five-month long Battle of Stalingrad,   aiming to destroy German forces in and around Stalingrad. Planning for Operation Uranus had commenced in September 1942, and developed simultaneously with plans to envelop and destroy German Army Group Center (Operation Mars) and German forces in the Caucasus. The Red Army took advantage of the German army's poor preparations for winter, and the fact that its forces in the southern Soviet Union were overstretched near Stalingrad, using weaker Romanian troops to guard their flanks; the offensive's starting points were established along the section of the front directly opposite Romanian forces. These Axis armies lacked heavy equipment to deal with Soviet armor.","image":"Operation_Uranus.svg.png.webp"}
