{"title":"Cockfight","summary":"A cockfight is a blood sport, held in a ring called a cockpit. The history of raising fowl for fighting goes back 6,000 years. The first documented use of the word gamecock, denoting use of the cock as to a \"game\", a sport, pastime or entertainment, was recorded in 1634,[1] after the term \"cock of the game\" used by George Wilson, in the earliest known book on the sport of cockfighting in The Commendation of Cocks and Cock Fighting in 1607. But it was during Magellan's voyage of discovery of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented for Westerners by the Italian Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, in the Kingdom of Taytay.","image":"Microcosm_of_London_Plate_018_-_Royal_Cock_Pit_(colour).jpg.webp","url":"Cockfight"}
