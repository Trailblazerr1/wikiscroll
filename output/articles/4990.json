{"title":"Australian ringneck","summary":"The Australian ringneck (Barnardius zonarius) is a parrot native to Australia. Except for extreme tropical and highland areas, the species has adapted to all conditions. Treatments of genus Barnardius have previously recognised two species, the Port Lincoln parrot (Barnardius zonarius) and the mallee ringneck (Barnardius barnardi),[2] but due to these readily interbreeding at the contact zone they are usually regarded as a single species B. zonarius with subspecific descriptions.[3][4] Currently, four subspecies are recognised, each with a distinct range.","image":"Mallee_ringneck_42_-_Patchewollock.jpg.webp","url":"Australian_ringneck"}
