{"title":"Constitution of 3 May 1791","summary":"The Constitution of 3 May 1791,[1][lower-alpha 1] titled the Governance Act,[lower-alpha 2] was a constitution adopted by the Great Sejm (\"Four-Year Sejm\", meeting in 1788–92) for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a dual monarchy comprising the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Constitution was designed to correct the Commonwealth's political flaws. It had been preceded by a period of agitation for—and gradual introduction of—reforms, beginning with the Convocation Sejm of 1764 and the ensuing election that year of Stanisław August Poniatowski, the Commonwealth's last king.","image":"Manuscript_of_the_Constitution_of_the_3rd_May_1791.PNG.webp","url":"Constitution_of_3_May_1791"}
