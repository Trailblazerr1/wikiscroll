This is the final full-length album to feature all four original members (Van Halen brothers, Roth, and Michael Anthony), although they reunited briefly in 2000 to start work on what would much later become 2012's A Different Kind of Truth.[3] Roth returned in 2007, but Eddie's son Wolfgang replaced Anthony in 2006.[2] 1984 and Van Halen's debut are Van Halen's bestselling albums, each having sold more than 10 million copies.[4]","image":"Van_Halen_-_1984.jpg.webp","url":"1984_(Van_Halen_album)"}
