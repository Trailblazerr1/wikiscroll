{"title":"Language of Jesus","summary":"The language of Jesus and his disciples is believed to be Aramaic.[1][2] This is the common language of Judea in the first century AD, most likely a Galilean dialect distinguishable from that of Jerusalem.[3] This is generally agreed upon by historians. The villages of Nazareth and Capernaum in Galilee, where Jesus spent most of his time, were Aramaic-speaking communities.[4] It is also likely that Jesus knew enough Koine Greek to converse with those not native to Judea, and it is reasonable to assume that Jesus was well versed in Hebrew for religious purposes.[5][6][7]","image":"JesusYeshua.svg.png.webp","url":"Language_of_Jesus"}
