{"title":"Volatile organic compound","summary":"Volatile organic compounds (VOC) are organic chemicals that have a high vapour pressure at  room temperature. High vapor pressure correlates with a low boiling point, which relates to the number of the sample's molecules in the surrounding air, a trait known as volatility.[1]","image":"Thermal-oxidizer-rto.jpg.webp"}
