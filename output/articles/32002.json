{"title":"Nick Foles","summary":"Nicholas Edward Foles (born January 20, 1989) is an American football quarterback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Arizona and was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2012 NFL Draft. Beginning his career as a backup, Foles was named the team's starter midway through his rookie season. He maintained his starting position through the 2013 season, where he set the NFL season record for the best TD-INT ratio and posted a perfect passer rating in a game. His success led the Eagles to an NFC East division title, while also earning him Pro Bowl honors. An unsuccessful 2014 campaign, however, resulted in Foles being traded to the St. Louis Rams, where he was released after struggling in his one season. He spent his following season as a backup for the Kansas City Chiefs.","image":"Nick_Foles_Philadelphia_Eagles_Super_Bowl_LII_Victory_Parade_(40140602902)_(cropped1).jpg.webp"}
