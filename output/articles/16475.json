{"title":"Flinders Petrie","summary":"Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, FRS, FBA (3 June 1853 – 28 July 1942), commonly known as Flinders Petrie, was an English Egyptologist and a pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology and preservation of artefacts.[3] He held the first chair of Egyptology in the United Kingdom, and excavated many of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt in conjunction with his wife, Hilda Petrie.[4] Some consider his most famous discovery to be that of the Merneptah Stele,[5] an opinion with which Petrie himself concurred.[6]","image":"Flinders_Petrie.jpg.webp","url":"Flinders_Petrie"}
