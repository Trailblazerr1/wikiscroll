{"title":"Naturalism (theatre)","summary":"Naturalism is a movement in European drama and theatre that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It refers to theatre that attempts to create an illusion of reality through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies. Interest in naturalism especially flourished with the French playwrights of the time, but the most successful example is Strindberg's play Miss Julie, which was written with the intention to abide by both his own particular version of naturalism, and also the version described by the French novelist and literary theoretician, Ã‰mile Zola.[2]","image":"MissJulie1906.jpg.webp","url":"Naturalism_(theatre)"}
