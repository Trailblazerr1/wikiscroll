{"title":"Professional wrestling aerial techniques","summary":"Aerial techniques, also known as \"high-flying moves\" are maneuvers in professional wrestling using the ring's posts and ropes as aids, in many cases to demonstrate the speed and agility of smaller, nimble and acrobatically inclined wrestlers preferring this style instead of throwing or locking the opponent. Due to injuries caused by these high risk moves, some promotions have banned the use of some of them. The next list of maneuvers was made under general categories whenever possible.","image":"Undertaker_oldschool_2.jpg.webp"}
