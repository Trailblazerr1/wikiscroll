The caldera is part of a volcanic island group (Krakatoa Archipelago) comprising four islands. Two, Lang and Verlaten, are remnants of a previous volcanic edifice destroyed in eruptions long before the famous 1883 eruption; another, Rakata, is the remnant of a much larger island destroyed in the 1883 eruption.","image":"Anak_Krakatau-1.JPG.webp"}
