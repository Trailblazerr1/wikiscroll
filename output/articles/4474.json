{"title":"Art of Mesopotamia","summary":"The 'art of Mesopotamia' has survived in the archaeological record from early hunter-gatherer societies (8th millennium BC) on to the Bronze Age cultures of the Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires.

Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia brought significant cultural developments, including the oldest examples of writing.","image":"Ebih-Il_Louvre_AO17551_n01.jpg.webp","url":"Art_of_Mesopotamia"}
