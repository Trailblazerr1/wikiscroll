{"title":"Mechanism design","summary":"Mechanism design is a field in economics and game theory that takes an objectives-first approach to designing economic mechanisms or incentives, toward desired objectives, in strategic settings, where players act rationally. Because it starts at the end of the game, then goes backwards, it is also called reverse game theory. It has broad applications, from economics and politics  in such fields as market design, auction theory and social choice theory to networked-systems (internet interdomain routing, sponsored search auctions).","image":"Stanley_Reiter_MDdiagram.png.webp","url":"Mechanism_design"}
