It was released in the United Kingdom by the company's subsidiary Columbia (CBS) in 1968[4] and in the United States during February 1969. The album is a transitional work for Davis, who was shifting stylistically from acoustic recordings with his second \"great\" quintet to his  \"electric\" period. Filles de Kilimanjaro was well received by contemporary music critics, who viewed it as a significant release in modern jazz.","image":"Miles_Davis-Filles_de_Kilimanjaro_(album_cover).jpg.webp","url":"Filles_de_Kilimanjaro"}
