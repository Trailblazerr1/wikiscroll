The novel offers a glimpse into the war between light and darkness, and good and evil, as the young characters mature into adolescents on their journey.[4] The novel wrestles with questions of spirituality and purpose, as the characters are often thrown into conflicts of love, divinity, and goodness.[4] It is the first book in L'Engle's Time Quintet, which follows the Murrys and Calvin O'Keefe.","image":"WrinkleInTimePBA1.jpg.webp"}
