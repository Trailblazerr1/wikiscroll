{"title":"Drone (bee)","summary":"A drone is a male honey bee. Unlike the female worker bee, drones do not have stingers. They gather neither nectar nor pollen and are unable to feed without assistance from worker bees. A drone's only role is to mate with an unfertilized queen.","image":"Drone_bee_(32-image_macro_stack).jpg.webp","url":"Drone_(bee)"}
