{"title":"Chinese bronze inscriptions","summary":"Chinese bronze inscriptions, also commonly referred to as bronze script or bronzeware script, are writing in a variety of Chinese scripts on ritual bronzes such as zhōng bells and dǐng tripodal cauldrons from the Shang dynasty (2nd millennium BC) to the Zhou dynasty (11th–3rd century BC) and even later. Early bronze inscriptions were almost always cast (that is, the writing was done with a stylus in the wet clay of the piece-mold from which the bronze was then cast), while later inscriptions were often engraved after the bronze was cast.[1] The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the Chinese family of scripts, preceded by the oracle bone script.","image":"Song_ding_inscription.jpg.webp","url":"Chinese_bronze_inscriptions"}
