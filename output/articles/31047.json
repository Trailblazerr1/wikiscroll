{"title":"Myth","summary":"Myth is a folklore genre consisting of narratives that play a fundamental role in a society, such as foundational tales or origin myths. The main characters in myths are usually non-humans, such as gods, demigods, and other supernatural figures.[1][2][3][4] However, others also include humans, animals, or combinations in their classificiation of myth.[5] Stories of everyday human beings, although often of leaders of some type, are usually contained in legends, as opposed to myths.[1][4] Myths are sometimes distinguished from legends in that myths deal with gods, usually have no historical basis, and are set in a world of the remote past, very different from that of the present.[4][6]","image":"Hotherus_and_wood_maidens_by_Froelich.jpg.webp"}
