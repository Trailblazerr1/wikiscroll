{"title":"Electric violin","summary":"An electric violin is a violin equipped with an electronic output of its sound. The term most properly refers to an instrument intentionally made to be electrified with built-in pickups, usually with a solid body. It can also refer to a violin fitted with an electric pickup of some type, although \"amplified violin\" or \"electro-acoustic violin\" are more accurate in that case.","image":"Electric_Violin_and_Electromagnetic_Pick_by_Leo_Fender_(1957).jpg.webp"}
