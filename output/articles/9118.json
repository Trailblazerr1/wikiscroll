{"title":"Centum and satem languages","summary":"Languages of the Indo-European family are classified as either centum languages or satem languages according to how the dorsal consonants (sounds of \"K\" and \"G\" type) of the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) developed. An example of the different developments is provided by the words for \"hundred\" found in the early attested Indo-European languages (which is where the two branches get their names). In centum languages, they typically began with a /k/ sound (Latin centum was pronounced with initial /k/), but in satem languages, they often began with /s/ (the example satem comes from the Avestan language of Zoroastrian scripture).","image":"Centum_Satem_map.png.webp"}
