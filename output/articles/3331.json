{"title":"Amide","summary":"In organic chemistry, an amide (/ˈæmaɪd/ or /ˈæmɪd/ or /ˈeɪmaɪd/ (listen),[1][2][3] also known as an organic amide or a carboxamide, is a compound with the general formula RC(=O)NR′R″, where R, R', and R″ represent organic groups or hydrogen atoms.[4][5] The amide group is called a peptide bond when it is part of the main chain of a protein, and an isopeptide bond when it occurs in a side chain, such as in the amino acids asparagine and glutamine. It can be viewed as a derivative of a carboxylic acid RC(=O)OH with the hydroxyl group –OH replaced by an amine group –NR′R″; or, equivalently, an acyl (alkanoyl) group RC(=O)– joined to an amine group.","image":"Amide-general.png.webp","url":"Amide"}
