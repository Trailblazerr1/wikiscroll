{"title":"Pauli exclusion principle","summary":"The Pauli exclusion principle is the quantum mechanical principle which states that two or more identical fermions (particles with half-integer spin) cannot occupy the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spinâ€“statistics theorem of 1940.","image":"Wolfgang_Pauli_young.jpg.webp"}
