{"title":"Philomena","summary":"Philomena (Greek: Ἁγία Φιλομένα), also known as Saint Philomena, was a young consecrated virgin whose remains were discovered on May 24–25, 1802, in the Catacomb of Priscilla. Three tiles enclosing the tomb bore an inscription, Pax Tecum Filumena (i.e. \"Peace be unto you, Philomena\"), that was taken to indicate that her name (in the Latin of the inscription) was Filumena (Ancient Greek: φιλουμένη, lit. 'beloved'), the English form of which is Philomena. Philomena is the patron saint of infants, babies, and youth.[2]","image":"Santa_Filomena_(escola_europeia_do_séc._XVIII).png.webp","url":"Philomena"}
