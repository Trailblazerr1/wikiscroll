{"title":"Parasitoid wasp","summary":"Parasitoid wasps are a large group of hymenopteran superfamilies, with all but the wood wasps (Orussoidea) being in the wasp-waisted Apocrita. As parasitoids, they lay their eggs on or in the bodies of other arthropods, sooner or later causing the death of these hosts. Different species specialise in hosts from different insect orders, most often Lepidoptera, though some select beetles, flies, or bugs; the spider wasps (Pompilidae) exclusively attack spiders.","image":"Ichneumon_wasp_(Megarhyssa_macrurus_lunato)_(7686081848).jpg.webp","url":"Parasitoid_wasp"}
