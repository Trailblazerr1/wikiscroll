{"title":"Album","summary":"An album is a collection of audio recordings issued as a collection on compact disc (CD), vinyl, audio tape, or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78-rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records  played at 33+1⁄3 rpm.","image":"Earlyalbum1.jpg.webp"}
