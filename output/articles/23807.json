{"title":"John Tyndall","summary":"John Tyndall FRS (/ˈtɪndəl/; 2 August 1820 – 4 December 1893) was a prominent 19th-century Irish physicist. His initial scientific fame arose in the 1850s from his study of diamagnetism. He published a work stating that carbon dioxide will result in global temperature change, not long after Eunice Newton Foote came up with the concept through a simple experiment. There is debate on whether or not Tyndall stole her work, although he had published a paper on colour blindness in the same issue of The American Journal of Science and Arts as her paper on climate change.","image":"JohnTyndall(1820-1893)%2CEngraving%2CSIL14-T003-09a_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"John_Tyndall"}
