{"title":"Architecture of Chicago","summary":"The buildings and architecture of Chicago have influenced and reflected the history of American architecture. The built environment of Chicago is reflective of the city's history and multicultural heritage, featuring prominent buildings in a variety of styles by many important architects. Since most structures within the downtown area were destroyed by the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 (the most famous exception being the Water Tower)[1] Chicago buildings are noted for their originality rather than their antiquity.","image":"Chicago_Sears_Tower_edit2.jpg.webp","url":"Architecture_of_Chicago"}
