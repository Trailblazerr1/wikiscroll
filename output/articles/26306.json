{"title":"Lipizzan","summary":"The Lipizzan or Lipizzaner (Croatian: Lipicanac, Czech: Lipicán, Hungarian: Lipicai, Italian: Lipizzano, Slovene: Lipicanec), is a horse breed named for the Lipizza Stud of the Habsburg monarchy. The breed is closely associated with the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, Austria, where the horses demonstrate the haute école or \"high school\" movements of classical dressage, including the highly controlled, stylized jumps and other movements known as the \"airs above the ground.\" The horses at the Spanish Riding School are trained using traditional methods that date back hundreds of years, based on the principles of classical dressage.","image":"Favory_Pallavicina.jpg.webp","url":"Lipizzan"}
