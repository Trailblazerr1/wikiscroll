{"title":"Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis","summary":"Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) is a condition featuring attacks of muscle weakness in the presence of hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if weakness of the breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate).[1][2] If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.[1]","image":"Illu08_thyroid.jpg.webp"}
