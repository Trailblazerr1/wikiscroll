{"title":"List of counties in Vermont","summary":"There are fourteen counties in the U.S. state of Vermont. These counties together contain 255 political units, or places, including 237 towns, 9 cities, 5 unincorporated areas, and 4 gores. Each county has a county seat, often referred to as a \"shire town.\" In 1779, Vermont had two counties. The western side of the state was called Bennington County and the eastern was called Cumberland County.[1] In 1781, Cumberland County was separated into three counties in Vermont plus another county named Washington (not the same as the modern Washington County) that eventually became part of New Hampshire. Today's Washington County was known as Jefferson County from its creation in 1810 until it was renamed in 1814. Essex County, Orleans County, and Caledonia County are commonly referred to as the Northeast Kingdom.","image":"Vermont_Locator_Map.PNG.webp"}
