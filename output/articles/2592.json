{"title":"Alain Badiou","summary":"Alain Badiou (/bɑːˈdjuː/; French: [alɛ̃ badju] (listen) ; born 17 January 1937) is a French philosopher, formerly chair of Philosophy at the École normale supérieure (ENS) and founder of the faculty of Philosophy of the Université de Paris VIII with Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault and Jean-François Lyotard. Badiou has written about the concepts of being, truth, event and the subject in a way that, he claims, is neither postmodern nor simply a repetition of modernity. Badiou has been involved in a number of political organisations, and regularly comments on political events. Badiou argues for a return of communism as a political force.[3]","image":"Alain_Badiou-2.jpg.webp","url":"Alain_Badiou"}
