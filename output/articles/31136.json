{"title":"NTFS","summary":"New Technology File System (NTFS) is a proprietary journaling file system developed by Microsoft.[2][1] Starting with Windows NT 3.1, it is the default file system of the Windows NT family.[11] It superseded File Allocation Table (FAT) as the preferred filesystem on Windows but is supported in Linux and BSD as well. NTFS reading and writing support is provided using a free and open-source kernel implementation known as NTFS3 in Linux and the NTFS-3G driver in BSD.[12][13] Windows can convert FAT32/16/12 into NTFS without the need to rewrite all files.[14] NTFS uses several files typically hidden from the user to store metadata about other files stored on the drive which can help improve speed and performance when reading data.[1] Unlike FAT and High Performance File System (HPFS), NTFS supports access control lists (ACLs), filesystem encryption, transparent compression, sparse files and file system journaling. NTFS also supports shadow copy to allow backups of a system while it is running, but the functionality of the shadow copies varies between different versions of Windows.[15]","image":"NTPermissions.png.webp","url":"NTFS"}
