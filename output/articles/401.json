{"title":"2005 German federal election","summary":"Federal elections were held in Germany on 18 September 2005 to elect the members of the 16th Bundestag. The snap election was called after the government's defeat in a state election, which caused them to intentionally lose a motion of confidence to trigger an early federal election. The outgoing government was a coalition of the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and Alliance 90/The Greens, led by federal Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der. The election was originally intended for the autumn of 2006.[1][2]","image":"Flag_of_Germany.svg.png.webp"}
