{"title":"British Iron Age","summary":"The British Iron Age is a conventional name used in the archaeology of Great Britain, referring to the prehistoric and protohistoric phases of the Iron Age culture of the main island and the smaller islands, typically excluding prehistoric Ireland, which had an independent Iron Age culture of its own.[1] The parallel phase of Irish archaeology is termed the Irish Iron Age.[2] The Iron Age is not an archaeological horizon of common artefacts, but is rather a locally diverse cultural phase.","image":"Aerial_photograph_of_Maiden_Castle%2C_1935.jpg.webp","url":"British_Iron_Age"}
