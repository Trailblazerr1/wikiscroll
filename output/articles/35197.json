{"title":"Plasmodium vivax","summary":"Plasmodium vivax is a protozoal parasite and a human pathogen. This parasite is the most frequent and widely distributed cause of recurring malaria.[2]  Although it is less virulent than Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the five human malaria parasites,  P. vivax malaria infections can lead to severe disease and death, often due to splenomegaly (a pathologically enlarged spleen).[3][4] P. vivax is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito; the males do not bite.[5]","image":"Plasmodium_vivax_01.png.webp","url":"Plasmodium_vivax"}
