{"title":"Glycoprotein","summary":"Glycoproteins are proteins which contain oligosaccharide chains (glycans) covalently attached to amino acid side-chains. The carbohydrate is attached to the protein in a cotranslational or posttranslational modification. This process is known as glycosylation. Secreted extracellular proteins are often glycosylated.","image":"Glicoprotein.svg.png.webp","url":"Glycoprotein"}
