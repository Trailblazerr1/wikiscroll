{"title":"Wayang","summary":"Wayang, also known as wajang (Javanese: ꦮꦪꦁ, romanized: wayang), is a traditional form of puppet theatre play originated on the Indonesian island of Java.[1][2][3] Wayang refers to the entire dramatic show. Sometimes the leather puppet itself is referred to as wayang.[4] Performances of wayang puppet theatre are accompanied by a gamelan orchestra in Java, and by gender wayang in Bali. The dramatic stories depict mythologies, such as episodes from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, as well as local adaptations of cultural legends.[2][5][6] Traditionally, a wayang is played out in a ritualized midnight-to-dawn show by a dalang, an artist and spiritual leader; people watch the show from both sides of the screen.[2][5]","image":"Wayang_sejarah.jpg.webp","url":"Wayang"}
