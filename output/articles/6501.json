{"title":"Big band","summary":"A big band is a type of musical ensemble of jazz music that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular. The term \"big band\" is also used to describe a genre of music, although this was not the only style of music played by big bands.","image":"Whitemanband1921.jpg.webp"}
