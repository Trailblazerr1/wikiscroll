{"title":"Yazidis","summary":"Yazidis, also written as Yezidis (/jəˈziːdiːz/ (listen),[28] Kurdish: ئێزیدی‎, Êzidî[29][30]), are an endogamous and mostly Kurmanji-/Northern Kurdish-speaking[26] minority, indigenous to the Kurdish regions, which includes parts of Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey.[23][31][32] The majority of Yazidis remaining in the Middle East today live in the disputed territories of Northern Iraq, primarily in the Nineveh and Dohuk governorates.[33][34] There is a disagreement on whether Yazidis are a religious sub-group of Kurds or a distinct ethnoreligious group, among scholars and Yazidis themselves.[35][36] The Yazidi religion is monotheistic and has roots in a western pre-Zoroastrian Iranic faith.[37][38][39][40][41]","image":"CejnaCemaiye.jpg.webp","url":"Yazidis"}
