{"title":"New South","summary":"New South, New South Democracy or New South Creed is a slogan in the history of the American South after the American Civil War. Reformers used it to call for a modernization of society and attitudes, to integrate more fully with the United States, reject the economy and traditions of the Old South and the slavery-based plantation system of the antebellum period. The term was coined by its leading spokesman and Atlanta editor Henry W. Grady in 1874.[1]","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp"}
