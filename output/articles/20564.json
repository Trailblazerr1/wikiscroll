{"title":"History of the Jews in Turkey","summary":"The history of the Jews in Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Yahudileri; Hebrew: יהודים טורקים‎ Yehudim Turkim, Ladino: Djudios Turkos) covers the 2400 years that Jews have lived in what is now Turkey. There have been Jewish communities in Anatolia since at least the fifth century BCE and many Spanish and Portuguese Jews expelled from Spain by the Alhambra Decree were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire in the late 15th century, including regions now part of Turkey, centuries later, forming the bulk of the Ottoman Jews.","image":"Turkey_(orthographic_projection).svg.png.webp","url":"History_of_the_Jews_in_Turkey"}
