{"title":"Grand Slam (tennis)","summary":"The Grand Slam in tennis is the achievement of winning all four major championships in one discipline in the same calendar year, also referred to as the \"Calendar-year Grand Slam\" or \"Calendar Slam\". In doubles, a team may accomplish the Grand Slam playing together or a player may achieve it with different partners. Winning all four major championships consecutively but not within the same calendar year is referred to as a non-calendar-year Grand Slam, while winning the four majors at any point during the course of a career is known as a Career Grand Slam.[1][2]","image":"Flag_of_Serbia.svg.png.webp"}
