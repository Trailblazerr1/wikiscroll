{"title":"Judas Priest","summary":"Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham in 1969. They have sold over 50 million copies of their albums, and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with indifferent record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980, when they rose to commercial success with the album British Steel.","image":"Judas_Priest_-_Wacken_Open_Air_2018_01.jpg.webp","url":"Judas_Priest"}
