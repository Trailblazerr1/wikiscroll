{"title":"Melting point","summary":"The melting point (or, rarely, liquefaction point) of a substance is the temperature at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. The melting point of a substance depends on pressure and is usually specified at a standard pressure such as 1 atmosphere or 100 kPa.","image":"Melting_ice_thermometer.jpg.webp","url":"Melting_point"}
