{"title":"Megarachne","summary":"Megarachne is a genus of eurypterid, an extinct group of aquatic arthropods. Fossils of Megarachne have been discovered in deposits of Late Carboniferous age, from the Gzhelian stage, in San Luis, Argentina. The fossils of the single and type species M. servinei have been recovered from deposits that had once been a freshwater environment. The generic name, composed of the Ancient Greek μέγας (megas) meaning \"great\" and Ancient Greek ἀράχνη (arachne) meaning \"spider\", translates to \"great spider\", because the fossil was misidentified as a large prehistoric spider.","image":"Megarachne_servinei.jpg.webp","url":"Megarachne"}
