{"title":"Bedouin","summary":"The Bedouin, Beduin or Bedu (/ˈbɛduɪn/;[23] Arabic: بَدْو‎, romanized: badū, singular بَدَوِي badawī) are nomadic Arab tribes who have historically inhabited the desert regions in the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa, the Levant, and Mesopotamia.[24] However, the Arabian Peninsula is the historic and original homeland of the Bedouin Arabs. The English word bedouin comes from the Arabic badawī, which means \"desert dweller\", and is traditionally contrasted with ḥāḍir, the term for sedentary people.[25] Bedouin territory stretches from the vast deserts of North Africa to the rocky sands of the Middle East.[26] They are traditionally divided into tribes, or clans (known in Arabic as ʿašāʾir; عَشَائِر), and historically share a common culture of herding camels and goats.[26] The vast majority of Bedouins adhere to Islam, although there are some fewer numbers of Christian Bedouins present in the Fertile Crescent.[27][28][29][30]","image":"\"Bedouin_Wedding_Procession\"_in_the_Jerusalem_section_of_the_Pike_at_the_1904_World's_Fair.jpg.webp"}
