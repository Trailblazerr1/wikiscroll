{"title":"History of the Jews in Germany","summary":"The history of the Jews in Germany goes back at least to the year 321,[2][3] and continued through the Early Middle Ages (5th to 10th centuries CE) and High Middle Ages (circa 1000–1299 CE) when Jewish immigrants founded the Ashkenazi Jewish community. The community survived under Charlemagne, but suffered during the Crusades. Accusations of well poisoning during the Black Death (1346–53) led to mass slaughter of German Jews[4] and they fled in large numbers to Poland. The Jewish communities of the cities of Mainz, Speyer and Worms became the center of Jewish life during medieval times. \"This was a golden age as area bishops protected the Jews resulting in increased trade and prosperity.\"[5]","image":"EU-Germany_(orthographic_projection).svg.png.webp","url":"History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany"}
