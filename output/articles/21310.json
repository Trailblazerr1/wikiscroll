{"title":"Hypertrichosis","summary":"Hypertrichosis is an abnormal amount of hair growth over the body.[1][2] The two distinct types of hypertrichosis are generalized hypertrichosis, which occurs over the entire body, and localized hypertrichosis, which is restricted to a certain area.[1] Hypertrichosis can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life.[3][4]  The excess growth of hair occurs in areas of the skin with the exception of androgen-dependent hair of the pubic area, face, and axillary regions.[5]","image":"Joris_Hoefnagel_-_Animalia_Rationalia_et_Insecta_(Ignis)-_Plate_I.jpg.webp"}
