{"title":"Historically black colleges and universities","summary":"Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are institutions of higher education in the United States that were established before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with the intention of primarily serving the African-American community. Most of these institutions were founded in the years after the American Civil War and are concentrated in the Southern United States.[1] During the period of segregation in the United States prior to the Civil Rights Act, the great majority of institutions of higher education served predominantly white students, and disqualified or limited Black American enrollment.[2][3] For a century after the end of slavery in the United States in 1865, most colleges and universities in the Southern United States prohibited all African Americans from attending, while institutions in other parts of the country regularly employed quotas to limit admissions of Black people.[4][5][6][7] HBCUs were established to give opportunities to African Americans, especially in the South.","image":"AmericaAfrica.svg.png.webp","url":"Historically_black_colleges_and_universities"}
