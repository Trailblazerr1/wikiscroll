{"title":"The Animals","summary":"The Animals (also billed as Eric Burdon and the Animals) are an English rhythm-and-blues and rock band, formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in the early 1960s. The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic number-one hit single \"The House of the Rising Sun\" as well as by hits such as  \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\", \"It's My Life\", \"Don't Bring Me Down\", \"I'm Crying\", \"See See Rider\" and \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\" The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material and were part of the British Invasion of the US.","image":"Eric_Burdon_%26_the_Animals.jpg.webp"}
