{"title":"Dirrty","summary":"\"Dirrty\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Christina Aguilera featuring American rapper Redman, released as the lead single from her fourth studio album Stripped. Despite Aguilera's first three years of commercial success, she was displeased with the lack of control over her image. In response, she desired to create a song that would represent her authentic persona. She approached hip hop producer Rockwilder and suggested using Redman's 2001 song \"Let's Get Dirty (I Can't Get in da Club)\" as a guide. The final result, \"Dirrty\", is an R&B and hip hop song that also features rapping verses from Redman and describes sexual activities.","image":"Christina_Aguilera_-_Dirrty_(single).png.webp"}
