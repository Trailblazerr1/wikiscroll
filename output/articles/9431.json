{"title":"Chayote","summary":"Chayote[1] (Sechium edule), also known as mirliton, g√ºisquil, pimpinela and choko, is an edible plant belonging to the gourd family, Cucurbitaceae. This fruit was first cultivated in the Mesoamericas between southern Mexico and Honduras, with the most genetic diversity available in both Mexico and Guatemala.[2] It is one of several foods introduced to the Old World during the Columbian Exchange. At that time, the plant spread to other parts of the Americas, ultimately causing it to be integrated into the cuisine of many Latin American nations.","image":"Chayote_BNC.jpg.webp","url":"Chayote"}
