{"title":"Synthesizer","summary":"A synthesizer (also spelled synthesiser)[1] is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. Synthesizers generate audio through methods including subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, and frequency modulation synthesis. These sounds may be shaped and modulated by components such as filters, envelopes, and low-frequency oscillators. Synthesizers are typically played with keyboards or controlled by sequencers, software, or other instruments. Synthesizers may be connected to other equipment via MIDI.","image":"R.A.Moog_minimoog_2.jpg.webp"}
