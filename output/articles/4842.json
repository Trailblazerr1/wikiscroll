{"title":"Atomic clock","summary":"An atomic clock is a clock whose timekeeping mechanism is based on the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the excited states of certain atoms. Specifically, either a hyperfine transition in the microwave region, or an electron transition in the optical or ultraviolet region, of the emission spectrum of an atom is used as a frequency standard for the timekeeping element. Atomic clocks are the most accurate time and frequency standards known, and are used as primary standards for international time distribution services, to control the wave frequency of television broadcasts, and in global navigation satellite systems such as GPS.","image":"FOCS-1.jpg.webp"}
