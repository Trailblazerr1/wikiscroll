{"title":"Erotic asphyxiation","summary":"Erotic asphyxiation (variously called asphyxiophilia, hypoxyphilia or breath control play) is the intentional restriction of oxygen to the brain for the purposes of sexual arousal. The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when the act is done by a person to themselves. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a gasper.[1] Erotic asphyxiation can lead to accidental death due to asphyxia.","image":"Sada_Abe.jpg.webp","url":"Erotic_asphyxiation"}
