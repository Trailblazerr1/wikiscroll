{"title":"Toyota LiteAce","summary":"The Toyota LiteAce and TownAce are a line of light commercial and derivative passenger vans produced by the Japanese car manufacturer Toyota. These vehicles originally utilized the cab-over-engine configuration, although since 1996 a semi-cab-over arrangement has featured instead. The LiteAce launched in 1970 as light-duty truck, with commercial and van/wagon body variants added in 1971. In 1976, Toyota released the larger TownAce van/wagon that derived from the LiteAce; a TownAce truck arrived later in 1978. Between 1982 and 1992, the series accommodated the MasterAce Surfâ€”an upscale TownAce passenger wagon.","image":"1997-1999_Toyota_TownAce_(KR42R)_van_01.jpg.webp","url":"Toyota_LiteAce"}
