{"title":"Michaelis–Menten kinetics","summary":"In biochemistry, Michaelis–Menten kinetics is one of the best-known models of enzyme kinetics.[1][2] It is named after German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten.[3] The model takes the form of an equation describing the rate of enzymatic reactions, by relating reaction rate v {\\displaystyle v} (rate of formation of product, [ P ] {\\displaystyle [{\\ce {P}}]} ) to [ S ] {\\displaystyle [{\\ce {S}}]} , the concentration of a substrate S. Its formula is given by","image":"e07b00e7fc0847fbd16391c778d65bc25c452597.svg","url":"Michaelis–Menten_kinetics"}
