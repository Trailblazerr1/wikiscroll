{"title":"Michaelis–Menten kinetics","summary":"In biochemistry, Michaelis–Menten kinetics is one of the best-known models of enzyme kinetics.[1][2] It is named after German biochemist Leonor Michaelis and Canadian physician Maud Menten.[3] The model takes the form of an equation describing the rate of enzymatic reactions, by relating reaction rate \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v}\n  \n (rate of formation of product, \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        \n          P\n        \n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [{\\ce {P}}]}\n  \n) to \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        \n          S\n        \n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [{\\ce {S}}]}\n  \n, the concentration of a substrate S.
