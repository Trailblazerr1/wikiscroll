{"title":"Common pheasant","summary":"The common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) is a bird in the pheasant family (Phasianidae). The genus name comes from Latin phasianus, \"pheasant\". The species name colchicus is Latin for \"of Colchis\" (modern day Georgia), a country on the Black Sea where pheasants became known to Europeans.[2] Phasianus diverged from the genus Gallus, the genus of junglefowl and domesticated chickens, about 20 million years ago.[3]","image":"Common_pheasant_(Phasianus_colchicus)_cock_2.jpg.webp"}
