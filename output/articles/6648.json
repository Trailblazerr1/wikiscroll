{"title":"Biodiesel","summary":"Biodiesel is a form of diesel fuel derived from plants or animals and consisting of long-chain fatty acid esters. It is typically made by chemically reacting lipids such as animal fat (tallow),[1] soybean oil,[2] or some other vegetable oil with an alcohol, producing a methyl, ethyl or propyl ester by the process of transesterification.","image":"Régiolis_Granville-Paris_en_gare_d'Argentan_(août_2019).JPG.webp","url":"Biodiesel"}
