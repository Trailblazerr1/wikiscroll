{"title":"Necrosis","summary":"Necrosis (from Ancient Greek νέκρωσις, nékrōsis, \"death\") is a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of cells in living tissue by autolysis.[1] Necrosis is caused by factors external to the cell or tissue, such as infection, or trauma which result in the unregulated digestion of cell components. In contrast, apoptosis is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of cellular death. While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism, necrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal.[2]","image":"Structural_changes_of_cells_undergoing_necrosis_or_apoptosis.png.webp","url":"Necrosis"}
