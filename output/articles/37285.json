{"title":"Real number","summary":"In mathematics, a real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line (or alternatively, a quantity that can be represented as an infinite decimal expansion). The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes, who distinguished between real and imaginary roots of polynomials. The real numbers include all the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4/3, and all the irrational numbers, such as 2 {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}} (1.41421356..., the square root of 2, an irrational algebraic number). Included within the irrationals are the real transcendental numbers, such as π (3.14159265...).[1]  In addition to measuring distance, real numbers can be used to measure quantities such as time, mass, energy, velocity, and many more. The set of real numbers is denoted using the symbol R or R {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} } [2] and is sometimes called \"the reals\".[3]","image":"b4afc1e27d418021bf10898eb44a7f5f315735ff.svg","url":"Real_number"}
