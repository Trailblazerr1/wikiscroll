{"title":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding","summary":"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding is a book by the Scottish empiricist philosopher David Hume, published in English in 1748.[1] It was a revision of an earlier effort, Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature, published anonymously in London in 1739â€“40. Hume was disappointed with the reception of the Treatise, which \"fell dead-born from the press,\"[2] as he put it, and so tried again to disseminate his more developed ideas to the public by writing a shorter and more polemical work.","image":"David_Hume.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fAn_Enquiry_Concerning_Human_Understanding"}
