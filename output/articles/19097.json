{"title":"Guaranteed Rate Field","summary":"Guaranteed Rate Field is a baseball park located on the South Side of Chicago, Illinois.  The ballpark serves as the home ballpark for Major League Baseball's Chicago White Sox, and is owned by the state of Illinois through the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority. The park opened for the 1991 season, after the White Sox had spent 81 years at the original Comiskey Park. It was completed at a cost of US$137 million, and opened with the name Comiskey Park, but was renamed U.S. Cellular Field in 2003 after U.S. Cellular purchased the naming rights at $68 million over 20 years.[8] The current name was announced on October 31, 2016, after Guaranteed Rate, a private residential mortgage company located in Chicago, purchased the naming rights to the ballpark in a 13-year deal.[9][10]","image":"Guaranteed_Rate_Field_logo.png.webp","url":"Guaranteed_Rate_Field"}
