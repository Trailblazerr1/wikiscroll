{"title":"George Mikan","summary":"George Lawrence Mikan Jr. (June 18, 1924 – June 1, 2005), nicknamed \"Mr. Basketball\", was an American professional basketball player for the Chicago American Gears of the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Minneapolis Lakers of the NBL, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Invariably playing with thick, round spectacles, the 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), 245 lb (111 kg) Mikan is seen as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, as well as one of the pioneers of professional basketball, redefining it as a game of so-called big men with his prolific rebounding, shot blocking, and his talent to shoot over smaller defenders with his ambidextrous hook shot, the result of the eponymous Mikan Drill.[1] He also utilized the underhanded free-throw shooting technique long before Rick Barry made it his signature shot.[2]","image":"George_Mikan_1945.jpeg.webp"}
