{"title":"Advance Australia Fair","summary":"\"Advance Australia Fair\" is the national anthem of Australia. Written by Scottish-born composer Peter Dodds McCormick, the song was first performed in 1878, sung in Australia as a patriotic song. It first replaced \"God Save the Queen\" in 1974 as the official national anthem, following a nationwide opinion survey. \"God Save the Queen\" was reinstated in January 1976, with \"Advance Australia Fair\", returning in 1984. This followed a plebiscite to choose the national song in 1977. \"God Save the Queen\" became known as the royal anthem, which is used at public engagements attended by the Queen or members of the Royal Family. The 1984 version of \"Advance Australia Fair\" has lyrics modified from McCormick's original and verses trimmed down from four to two. In January 2021 the lyrics were changed again.","image":"Advance_Australia_Fair.png.webp"}
