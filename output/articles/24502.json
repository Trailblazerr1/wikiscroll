{"title":"Kaveri","summary":"The Kaveri (also known as Cauvery, the anglicized name) is an Indian river flowing through the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. In Ancient times, It was also called as Ponni (the golden maid- as the Cauvery is sometimes called, in reference to the fine silt it deposits) in Tamil literature.[3][4][5] The Kaveri river rises at Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri range in the Western Ghats, Kodagu district of the state of  Karnataka, at an elevation of 1,341 m above mean sea level and flows for about 800 km before its outfall into the Bay of Bengal. It reaches the sea in Poompuhar in Mayiladuthurai district. It is the third largest river – after Godavari and Krishna – in southern India and the largest in the State of Tamil Nadu, which, on its course, bisects the state into North and South.","image":"Kaveri_at_Shrirangapatnam.JPG.webp"}
