{"title":"Peanuts","summary":"Peanuts is a syndicated daily and Sunday American comic strip written and illustrated by Charles M. Schulz. The strip's original run extended from 1950 to 2000, continuing in reruns afterward. Peanuts is among the most popular and influential in the history of comic strips, with 17,897 strips published in all,[1] making it \"arguably the longest story ever told by one human being\".[2][3] At the time of Schulz's death in 2000, Peanuts ran in over 2,600 newspapers, with a readership of around 355 million in 75 countries, and was translated into 21 languages.[4] It helped to cement the four-panel gag strip as the standard in the United States,[5] and together with its merchandise earned Schulz more than $1 billion.[1]","image":"Peanuts_gang.png.webp"}
