{"title":"List of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement","summary":"The denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement are sometimes collectively referred to as Mormonism. Although some denominations oppose the use of this term because they consider it derogatory, it is especially used when referring to the largest Latter Day Saint group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and offshoots of it. Denominations opposed to the use of the term consider it to be connected to the polygamy once practiced by the Utah church[1][2] or to pejoratives used against early adherents of the movement.[3][4]","image":"Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr._portrait_owned_by_Joseph_Smith_III.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_denominations_in_the_Latter_Day_Saint_movement"}
