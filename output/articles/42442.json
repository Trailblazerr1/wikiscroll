{"title":"Strange Fruit","summary":"\"Strange Fruit\" is a song written and composed by Abel Meeropol and recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939. The lyrics were drawn from a poem by Meeropol published in 1937. The song protests the lynching of Black Americans with lyrics that compare the victims to the fruit of trees. Such lynchings had reached a peak in the Southern United States at the turn of the 20th century, and the great majority of victims were black.[2] The song has been called \"a declaration\" and \"the beginning of the civil rights movement\".[3]","image":"Strange-Fruit-Commodore-1939.jpg.webp"}
