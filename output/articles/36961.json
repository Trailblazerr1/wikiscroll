{"title":"Radiosurgery","summary":"Radiosurgery is surgery using radiation,[1] that is, the destruction of precisely selected areas of tissue using ionizing radiation rather than excision with a blade. Like other forms of radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy), it is usually used to treat cancer. Radiosurgery was originally defined by the Swedish neurosurgeon Lars Leksell as \"a single high dose fraction of radiation, stereotactically directed to an intracranial region of interest\".[2]","image":"Intraoperative_photograph_showing_a_radiosurgery_system.png.webp","url":"Radiosurgery"}
