{"title":"Declaratory judgment","summary":"A declaratory judgment, also called a declaration, is the legal determination of a court that resolves legal uncertainty for the litigants. It is a form of legally binding preventive by which a party involved in an actual or possible legal matter can ask a court to conclusively rule on and affirm the rights, duties, or obligations of one or more parties in a civil dispute (subject to any appeal).[1] The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States,[2] and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity.[3][4] A declaratory judgment does not by itself order any action by a party, or imply damages or an injunction, although it may be accompanied by one or more other remedies.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
