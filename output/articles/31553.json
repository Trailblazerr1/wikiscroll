{"title":"Near and far field","summary":"The near field and far field are regions of the electromagnetic field (EM) around an object, such as a transmitting antenna, or the result of radiation scattering off an object. Non-radiative near-field behaviors dominate close to the antenna or scattering object, while electromagnetic radiation far-field behaviors dominate at greater distances.","image":"FarNearFields-USP-4998112-1.svg.png.webp"}
