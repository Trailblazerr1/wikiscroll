{"title":"Oculomotor nerve","summary":"The oculomotor nerve is the third cranial nerve (CN III). It enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and innervates extrinsic eye muscles that enable most movements of the eye and that raise the eyelid.  The nerve also contains fibers that innervate the intrinsic eye muscles that enable pupillary constriction and accommodation (ability to focus on near objects as in reading). The oculomotor nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic midbrain. Cranial nerves IV and VI also participate in control of eye movement.[1]","image":"Gray776.png.webp","url":"Oculomotor_nerve"}
