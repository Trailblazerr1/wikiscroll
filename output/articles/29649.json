{"title":"Michael Dummett","summary":"Sir Michael Anthony Eardley Dummett[lower-alpha 1] FBA (27 June 1925 – 27 December 2011) was an English academic described as \"among the most significant British philosophers of the last century and a leading campaigner for racial tolerance and equality.\"[5] He was, until 1992, Wykeham Professor of Logic at the University of Oxford. He wrote on the history of analytic philosophy, notably as an interpreter of Frege, and made original contributions particularly in the philosophies of mathematics, logic, language and metaphysics. He was known for his work on truth and meaning and their implications to debates between realism and anti-realism, a term he helped to popularize. He devised the Quota Borda system of proportional voting, based on the Borda count. In mathematical logic, he developed an intermediate logic, already studied by Kurt Gödel: the Gödel–Dummett logic.","image":"Michael_Dummett_September_2004.jpg.webp"}
