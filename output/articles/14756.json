{"title":"Empiricism","summary":"In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience.[1]  It is one of several views of epistemology, along with rationalism and skepticism. Empiricism emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, rather than innate ideas or traditions.[2] However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.[3]","image":"Somer_Francis_Bacon.jpg.webp"}
