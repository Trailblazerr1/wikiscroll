{"title":"Quanah Parker","summary":"Quanah Parker (Comanche kwana, \"smell, odor\") (c. 1845 – February 20, 1911) was a war leader of the Kwahadi (\"Antelope\") band of the Comanche Nation. He  was likely born into the Nokoni (\"Wanderers\") band of Tabby-nocca and grown up among the Kwahadis, the son of Kwahadi Comanche chief Peta Nocona and Cynthia Ann Parker, an Anglo-American who had been kidnapped as a child and assimilated into the Nokoni tribe. Following the apprehension of several Kiowa chiefs in 1871, Quanah Parker emerged as a dominant figure in the Red River War, clashing repeatedly with Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie. With European-Americans hunting American bison, the Comanches' primary sustenance, into near extinction, Quanah Parker eventually surrendered and peaceably led the Kwahadi to the reservation at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.","image":"Quanah_Parker_c1890.png.webp"}
