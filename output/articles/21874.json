{"title":"Indigenous peoples in Canada","summary":"Indigenous peoples in Canada (also known as Aboriginals)[2] are the indigenous peoples within the boundaries of Canada. They comprise the First Nations,[3] Inuit[4] and MÃ©tis.[5] Although \"Indian\" is a term still commonly used in legal documents, the descriptors \"Indian\" and \"Eskimo\" have fallen into disuse in Canada, and most consider them to be pejorative.[2][6][7] \"Aboriginal\" as a collective noun[8] is a specific term of art used in some legal documents, including the Constitution Act, 1982, though in some circles that word is also falling into disfavour.[9][10]","image":"Native_Americans_Race.svg.png.webp","url":"Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada"}
