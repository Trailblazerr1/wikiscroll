{"title":"Delicatessen","summary":"Traditionally, a delicatessen or \"deli\" is a retail establishment that sells a selection of fine, exotic, or foreign prepared foods. Delicatessen originated in Germany (original: Delikatessen) during the 18th century and spread to the United States in the mid-19th century. European immigrants to the United States, especially Ashkenazi Jews, popularized the delicatessen in American culture beginning in the late 19th century. More recently, many larger retail stores like supermarkets have \"deli\" sections.","image":"Rome_Italian_deli.jpg.webp"}
