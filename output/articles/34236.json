{"title":"Pawn (chess)","summary":"The pawn (♙, ♟) is the most numerous piece in the game of chess and, in most circumstances, the weakest. It historically represents soldiers or infantry, or more particularly, armed peasants or pikemen.[1] Each player begins a game with eight pawns, one on each square of the rank immediately in front of the other pieces. (The white pawns start on a2, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2, h2; the black pawns start on a7, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7, h7.)","image":"Chess_piece_-_White_pawn.JPG.webp","url":"Pawn_(chess)"}
