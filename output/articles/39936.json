{"title":"Seizure","summary":"An epileptic seizure, formally known as a seizure, is a period of symptoms due to abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.[5] Outward effects vary from uncontrolled shaking movements involving much of the body with loss of consciousness (tonic-clonic seizure), to shaking movements involving only part of the body with variable levels of consciousness (focal seizure), to a subtle momentary loss of awareness (absence seizure).[3] Most of the time these episodes last less than two minutes and it takes some time to return to normal.[4][7] Loss of bladder control may occur.[3]","image":"Spike-waves.png.webp","url":"Seizure"}
