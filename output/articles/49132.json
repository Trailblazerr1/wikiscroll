{"title":"Yakiniku","summary":"Yakiniku (焼き肉 or 焼肉), meaning \"grilled meat\", is a Japanese term that, in its broadest sense, refers to grilled meat cuisine. \"Yakiniku\" originally referred to western \"barbecue\" food, the term being popularized by Japanese writer Kanagaki Robun (仮名垣魯文) in his Seiyo Ryoritsu (i.e. \"western food handbook\") in 1872 (Meiji period).[1]  The term later became associated with Korean-derived cuisine during the early Shōwa period.[2][3][4][5][6][7] Due to the Korean War, the terms associated with Korea in Japan were divided into North Korea (Kita Chōsen) and South Korea (Kankoku); the reference to a \"yakiniku restaurant\" arose as a politically correct term for restaurants of either origin.[8][9]","image":"Yakinikuwiki.jpg.webp","url":"Yakiniku"}
