{"title":"Climate model","summary":"Numerical climate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the important drivers of climate, including atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the climate system to projections of future climate.  Climate models may also be qualitative (i.e. not numerical) models and also narratives, largely descriptive, of possible futures.[1]","image":"Global_Climate_Model.png.webp"}
