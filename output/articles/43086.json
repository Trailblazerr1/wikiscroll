{"title":"Symbiosis","summary":"Symbiosis (from Greek συμβίωσις, symbíōsis, \"living together\", from σύν, sýn, \"together\", and βίωσις, bíōsis, \"living\")[2] is any type of a close and long-term biological interaction between two different biological organisms, be it mutualistic, commensalistic, or parasitic. The organisms, each termed a symbiont, must be of different species. In 1879, Heinrich Anton de Bary defined it as \"the living together of unlike organisms\". The term was subject to a century-long debate about whether it should specifically denote mutualism, as in lichens. Biologists have now abandoned that restriction.","image":"Common_clownfish_curves_dnsmpl.jpg.webp","url":"Symbiosis"}
