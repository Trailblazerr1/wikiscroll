{"title":"Rings of Neptune","summary":"The rings of Neptune consist primarily of five principal rings and were first discovered (as \"arcs\") on 22 July 1984 by Patrice Bouchet, Reinhold Häfner and Jean Manfroid at La Silla Observatory (ESO) in Chile during an observing program proposed by André Brahic and Bruno Sicardy from Paris Observatory, and at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory by F. Vilas and L.-R. Elicer for a program led by William Hubbard.[1][2] They were eventually imaged in 1989 by the Voyager 2 spacecraft.[3] At their densest, they are comparable to the less dense portions of Saturn's main rings such as the C ring and the Cassini Division, but much of Neptune's ring system is quite tenuous, faint and dusty, more closely resembling the rings of Jupiter. Neptune's rings are named after astronomers who contributed important work on the planet:[3] Galle, Le Verrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams.[4][5] Neptune also has a faint unnamed ring coincident with the orbit of the moon Galatea. Three other moons orbit between the rings: Naiad, Thalassa and Despina.[5]","image":"Neptunian_rings_scheme_2.svg.png.webp"}
