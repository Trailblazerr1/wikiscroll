{"title":"f-number","summary":"In optics, the f-number of an optical system such as a camera lens is the ratio of the system's focal length to the diameter of the entrance pupil (\"clear aperture\").[1][2][3] It is also known as the focal ratio, f-ratio, or f-stop, and is very important in photography.[4] It is a dimensionless number that is a quantitative measure of lens speed; increasing the f-number is referred to as stopping down. The f-number is commonly indicated using a lower-case hooked f with the format f/N, where N is the f-number.","image":"Aperture_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
