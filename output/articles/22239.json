{"title":"Internet Explorer","summary":"Internet Explorer[lower-alpha 1] (formerly Microsoft Internet Explorer[lower-alpha 2] and Windows Internet Explorer,[lower-alpha 3] (from August 16, 1995 to March 30, 2021) commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a discontinued series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in-service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later versions of Windows. New feature development for the browser was discontinued in 2016[5] in favor of new browser Microsoft Edge.[6][7] Since Internet Explorer is a Windows component and is included in long-term lifecycle versions of Windows such as Windows Server 2019, it will continue to receive security updates until at least 2029.[8] Microsoft 365 ended support for Internet Explorer on August 17, 2021, and Microsoft Teams ended support for IE on November 30, 2020. Internet Explorer will be discontinued on June 15, 2022, after which the alternative will be Microsoft Edge with IE mode for legacy sites.[9]","image":"Internet_Explorer_10%2B11_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Internet_Explorer"}
