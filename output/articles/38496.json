{"title":"Rooting (Android)","summary":"Rooting is the process of allowing users of the Android mobile operating system to attain privileged control (known as root access) over various Android subsystems.  As Android is based on a modified version of the Linux kernel, rooting an Android device gives similar access to administrative (superuser) permissions as on Linux or any other Unix-like operating system such as FreeBSD or macOS.","image":"Root_Verifier_(open_source)_screenshot_on_a_rooted_Samsung_S10e.jpg.webp"}
