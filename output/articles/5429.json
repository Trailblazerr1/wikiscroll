{"title":"Ballpoint pen","summary":"A ballpoint pen, also known as a biro[1] (British English), ball pen (Philippine English), or dot pen[2] (Nepali) is a pen that dispenses ink (usually in paste form) over a metal ball at its point, i.e. over a \"ball point\". The metal commonly used is steel, brass, or tungsten carbide.[3] The design was conceived and developed as a cleaner and more reliable alternative to dip pens and fountain pens, and it is now the world's most-used writing instrument;[4] millions are manufactured and sold daily.[5] It has influenced art and graphic design and spawned an artwork genre.","image":"Ballpoint-pen-parts.jpg.webp"}
