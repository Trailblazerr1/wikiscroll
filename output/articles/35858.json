{"title":"Presbyopia","summary":"Presbyopia is physiological insufficiency of accommodation associated with the aging of the eye that results in progressively worsening ability to focus clearly on close objects.[4] Often referred to as 'reading blur' that affects many adults over the age of 40, symptoms include difficulty reading small print which results in having to hold reading material farther away.  Other symptoms associated can be headaches, and eyestrain.[4] Different people will have different degrees of problems.[1] Other types of refractive errors may exist at the same time as presbyopia.[1]  This condition is similar to hypermetropia or far-sightedness which starts in childhood and exhibits similar symptoms of blur in the vision for close objects.","image":"Pesto_ingredients_-_blurred.jpg.webp","url":"Presbyopia"}
