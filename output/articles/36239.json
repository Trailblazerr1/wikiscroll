{"title":"Promethazine","summary":"Promethazine is a first-generation antihistamine and antipsychotic used to treat allergies, insomnia, and nausea. It was once widely used as an antipsychotic, although it is generally not used for this purpose now. It has approximately 1/10 the antipsychotic strength of chlorpromazine. [4] It may also help with some symptoms associated with the common cold[4] and may also be used for sedating people who are agitated or anxious.[5][6] Promethazine is available by mouth in syrup or tablet dosage forms, as a rectal suppository, or by injection into a muscle.[4]","image":"Promethazine.svg.png.webp"}
