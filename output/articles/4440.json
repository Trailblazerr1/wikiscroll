{"title":"Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem","summary":"On 1 November 1963, Ngô Đình Diệm, the president of South Vietnam, was arrested and assassinated in a successful coup d'état led by General Dương Văn Minh. The coup was the culmination of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in the country. Discontent with the Diệm regime had been simmering below the surface and exploded with mass Buddhist protests against longstanding religious discrimination after the government shooting of protesters who defied a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag.","image":"Corpse_of_Ngô_Đình_Diệm_in_the_1963_coup.jpg.webp"}
