{"title":"Mechanical filter","summary":"A mechanical filter is a signal processing filter usually used in place of an electronic filter at radio frequencies.  Its purpose is the same as that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others.  The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal.  At the input and output of the filter, transducers convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations.","image":"Kokusai_mechanical_filter.jpg.webp","url":"Mechanical_filter"}
