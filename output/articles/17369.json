{"title":"Gambling","summary":"Gambling (also known as betting) is the wagering something of value (\"the stakes\") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the intent of winning something else of value. Gambling thus requires three elements to be present: consideration (an amount wagered), risk (chance), and a prize.[1] The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.","image":"Caravaggio_(Michelangelo_Merisi)_-_The_Cardsharps_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp"}
