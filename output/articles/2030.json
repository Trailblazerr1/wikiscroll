{"title":"Acetylacetone","summary":"Acetylacetone is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COCH2COCH3.  It is a colorless liquid, classified as a 1,3-diketone.  It exists in equilibrium with a tautomer CH3C(O)CH=(OH)CH3.  These tautomers interconvert so rapidly under most conditions that they are treated as a single compound in most applications.[2]  It is a colorless liquid that is a precursor to acetylacetonate anion (commonly abbreviated acacâˆ’), a bidentate ligand. It is also a building block for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds.","image":"Acetyloaceton.svg.png.webp"}
