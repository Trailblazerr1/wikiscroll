{"title":"Wild fisheries","summary":"A wild fishery is a natural body of water with a sizeable free-ranging fish or other aquatic animal (crustaceans and molluscs) population that can be harvested for its commercial value.  Wild fisheries can be marine (saltwater) or lacustrine/riverine (freshwater), and rely heavily on the carrying capacity of the local aquatic ecosystem.","image":"Krabbenkutter_Ivonne_Pellworm_P5242390jm.JPG.webp","url":"Wild_fisheries"}
