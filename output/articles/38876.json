{"title":"SMS Blücher","summary":"SMS Blücher[lower-alpha 1] was the last armored cruiser built by the German Empire. She was designed to match what German intelligence incorrectly believed to be the specifications of the British  Invincible-class battlecruisers. Blücher was larger than preceding armored cruisers and carried more heavy guns, but was unable to match the size and armament of the battlecruisers which replaced armored cruisers in the British Royal Navy and German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine). The ship was named after the Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher, the commander of Prussian forces at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-61-11%2C_Großer_Kreuzer_\"SMS_Blücher\".jpg.webp"}
