{"title":"Himno Nacional Mexicano","summary":"The \"Mexican National Anthem\" (Spanish: Himno Nacional Mexicano, Nahuatl languages: Mexihcaletepetlacuicalt[1]), also known by its incipit \"Mexicans, at the cry of war\" (Spanish: Mexicanos, al grito de guerra), is the national anthem of Mexico. The anthem was first used in 1854. The lyrics of the national anthem, which allude to historical Mexican military victories in the heat of battle and including cries of defending the homeland, were composed by poet Francisco González Bocanegra after a Federal contest in 1853. Later, in 1854, he asked Jaime Nunó to compose the music which now accompanies González's poem. The national anthem, consisting of ten stanzas and a chorus, effectively entered into use on September 16, 1854.","image":"Himno_mexicanos_text.jpg.webp","url":"Himno_Nacional_Mexicano"}
