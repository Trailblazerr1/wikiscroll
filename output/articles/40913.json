{"title":"SkyTrain (Vancouver)","summary":"SkyTrain is a medium-capacity rapid transit system in the Metro Vancouver Regional District, serving Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and surrounding municipalities.[8] SkyTrain has 79.6 km (49.5 mi) of track[3] and uses fully automated trains on grade-separated tracks running on underground and elevated guideways, allowing SkyTrain to hold consistently high on-time reliability.[9] The name \"SkyTrain\" was coined for the system during Expo 86 because the first line (Expo) principally runs on elevated guideway outside of Downtown Vancouver, providing panoramic views of the metropolitan area. SkyTrain uses the world's second-longest cable-supported transit-only bridge, known as SkyBridge, to cross the Fraser River.[10]","image":"Skytrain.svg.png.webp","url":"SkyTrain_(Vancouver)"}
