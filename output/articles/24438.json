{"title":"Kashrut","summary":"Kashrut (also kashruth or kashrus, כַּשְׁרוּת‎) is a set of dietary laws dealing with the foods that Jews are permitted to eat and how those foods must be prepared according to Jewish law. Food that may be consumed is deemed kosher (/ˈkoʊʃər/ in English, Yiddish: כּשר‎), from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the term that in Modern Hebrew is pronounced kashér (כָּשֵׁר‎), meaning \"fit\" (in this context: \"fit for consumption\").","image":"Star_of_David.svg.png.webp","url":"Kashrut"}
