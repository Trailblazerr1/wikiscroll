{"title":"Scream 4","summary":"Scream 4 (stylized as SCRE4M) is a 2011 American meta slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. Produced by Outerbanks Entertainment and distributed by Dimension Films, it is the fourth installment in the Scream film series. The film stars David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere, Anthony Anderson, Alison Brie, Adam Brody, Rory Culkin, Marielle Jaffe, Erik Knudsen, Mary McDonnell, Marley Shelton, and Nico Tortorella. The film takes place on the fifteenth anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders and involves Sidney Prescott returning to the town after ten years, where Ghostface once again begins killing students from Woodsboro High. Like its predecessors, Scream 4 combines the violence of the slasher genre with elements of black comedy and \"whodunit\" mystery to satirize the clich√©s of film remakes. The film also provides commentary on the extensive usage of social media and the obsession with internet fame.","image":"Scream4Poster.jpg.webp","url":"Scream_4"}
