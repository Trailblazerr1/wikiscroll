{"title":"Otitis media","summary":"Otitis media is a group of inflammatory diseases of the middle ear.[2] One of the two main types is acute otitis media (AOM),[3] an infection of rapid onset that usually presents with ear pain.[1] In young children this may result in pulling at the ear, increased crying, and poor sleep.[1] Decreased eating and a fever may also be present.[1] The other main type is otitis media with effusion (OME), typically not associated with symptoms,[1] although  occasionally a feeling of fullness is described;[4] it is defined as the presence of non-infectious fluid in the middle ear which may persist for weeks or months often after an episode of acute otitis media.[4] Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is middle ear inflammation that results in a perforated tympanic membrane with discharge from the ear for more than six weeks.[7] It may be a complication of acute otitis media.[4] Pain is rarely present.[4] All three types of otitis media may be associated with hearing loss.[2][3] If children with hearing loss due to OME do not learn sign language, it may affect their ability to learn.[8]","image":"Otitis_media_entdifferenziert2.jpg.webp","url":"Otitis_media"}
