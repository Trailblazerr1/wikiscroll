{"title":"Great Molasses Flood","summary":"The Great Molasses Flood, also known as the Boston Molasses Disaster,[1][2][3] occurred on January 15, 1919, in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. A large storage tank filled with 2.3 million US gal (8,700 m3)[4] weighing approximately 13,000 short tons (12,000 t) of molasses burst, and the resultant wave of molasses rushed through the streets at an estimated 35 mph (56 km/h), killing 21 and injuring 150.[5] The event entered local folklore and residents claimed for decades afterwards that the area still smelled of molasses on hot summer days.[6][5]","image":"BostonMolassesDisaster.jpg.webp","url":"Great_Molasses_Flood"}
