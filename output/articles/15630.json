{"title":"FLOPS","summary":"In computing, floating point operations per second (FLOPS, flops or flop/s) is a measure of computer performance, useful in fields of scientific computations that require floating-point calculations. For such cases, it is a more accurate measure than measuring instructions per second.","image":"Supercomputer_Power_(FLOPS)%2C_OWID.svg.png.webp"}
