{"title":"Celsius","summary":"The degree Celsius is a unit of temperature on the Celsius scale,[1] a temperature scale originally known as the centigrade scale.[2] The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale or a unit to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale. Before being renamed to honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.","image":"Pakkanen.jpg.webp","url":"Celsius"}
