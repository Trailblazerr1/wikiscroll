{"title":"Rosenhan experiment","summary":"The Rosenhan experiment or Thud experiment was an experiment conducted to determine the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. The participants feigned hallucinations to enter psychiatric hospitals but acted normally afterwards. They were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and were given antipsychotic medication. The study was conducted by psychologist David Rosenhan, a Stanford University professor, and published by the journal Science in 1973 under the title \"On Being Sane in Insane Places\".[1][2] It is considered an important and influential criticism of psychiatric diagnosis, and broached the topic of wrongful involuntary commitment.[3]","image":"Center_building_at_Saint_Elizabeths%2C_August_23%2C_2006.jpg.webp"}
