{"title":"Highway 61 Revisited","summary":"Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 30, 1965 by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing track, the 11-minute ballad \"Desolation Row\". Critics have focused on the innovative way Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that, in an important sense, the 1960s \"started\" with this album.[2]","image":"Bob_Dylan_-_Highway_61_Revisited.jpg.webp","url":"Highway_61_Revisited"}
