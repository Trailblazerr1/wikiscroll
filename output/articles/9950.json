{"title":"Chronic pain","summary":"Chronic pain is classified as pain that lasts longer than three to six months.[1] In medicine, the distinction between acute and chronic pain is sometimes determined by the amount of time since onset. Two commonly used markers are pain that continues at 3 months and 6 months since onset,[2] but some theorists and researchers have placed the transition from acute to chronic pain at 12 months.[3] Others apply the term acute to pain that lasts less than 30 days, chronic to pain of more than six months duration, and subacute to pain that lasts from one to six months.[4] A popular alternative definition of chronic pain, involving no fixed duration, is \"pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing\".[2]","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp"}
