{"title":"River Dee, Aberdeenshire","summary":"The River Dee (Scottish Gaelic: Uisge Dh√®) is a river in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It rises in the Cairngorms and flows through southern Aberdeenshire to reach the North Sea at Aberdeen.[3] The area it passes through is known as Deeside, or Royal Deeside in the region between Braemar and Banchory because Queen Victoria came for a visit there in 1848 and greatly enjoyed her visit. She and her husband, Prince Albert, replaced an old castle there and built Balmoral Castle.[4]","image":"River_Dee_at_Potarch._-_geograph.org.uk_-_110070.jpg.webp"}
