{"title":"Salafi movement","summary":"The Salafi movement, also called the Salafist movement, Salafiyya and Salafism, is a reform[1] branch[2][3][4] movement within Sunni Islam.[5] The name derives from advocating a return to the traditions of the  \"ancestors\" (salaf), the first three generations of Muslims said to know the unadulterated, pure form of Islam. Those generations include the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (the Sahabah), their successors (the Tabi‘un), and the successors of the successors (the Taba al-Tabi‘in). Practically, Salafis maintain that Muslims ought to rely on the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the 'Ijma (consensus) of the salaf, giving them precedence over the later Islamic hermeneutic teachings.[6]","image":"Allah3.svg.png.webp"}
