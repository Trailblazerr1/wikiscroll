{"title":"Kazakhs","summary":"The Kazakhs (also spelled Qazaqs; Kazakh: sg. Қазақ, Qazaq, [qɑˈzɑq] (listen), pl. Қазақтар, Qazaqtar, [qɑzɑqˈtɑr] (listen); the English name is transliterated from Russian; Russian: Казахи) are a Turkic ethnic group who mainly inhabit the Ural Mountains and northern parts of Central and East Asia (largely Kazakhstan, but also parts of Russia, Uzbekistan, Mongolia and China) in Eurasia. Kazakh identity is of medieval origin and was strongly shaped by the foundation of the Kazakh Khanate between 1456 and 1465, when several tribes under the rule of the sultans Janibek and Kerey departed from the Khanate of Abu'l-Khayr Khan in hopes of forming a powerful khanate of their own. Other notable Kazakh khans include Ablai Khan and Abul Khair Khan.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
