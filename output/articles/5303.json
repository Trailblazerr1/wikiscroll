{"title":"Backpacking (hiking)","summary":"Backpacking is the outdoor recreation of carrying gear on one's back, while hiking for more than a day. It is often, but not always, an extended journey,[1] and may or may not involve camping outdoors. In North America tenting is common, where simple shelters and mountain huts, widely found in Europe, are rare. In New Zealand, tramping is the term applied though overnight huts are frequently used.[2] Hill walking is an equivalent in Britain (but this can also refer to a day walk), though backpackers make use of a variety of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa.[3] Trekking and bushwalking are other word used to describe such multi-day trips.","image":"Backpacking_in_Grand_Teton_NP-NPS.jpg.webp","url":"Backpacking_(hiking)"}
