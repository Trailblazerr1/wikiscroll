{"title":"Pharaoh","summary":"Pharaoh (/ˈfɛəroʊ/ FAIR-oh, US also /ˈfeɪ.roʊ/ FAY-roh;[3] Coptic: ⲡⲣ̅ⲣⲟ, romanized: Pǝrro) is the common title now used for the monarchs of ancient Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150 BCE) until the annexation of Egypt by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE,[4] although the term \"pharaoh\" was not used contemporaneously for a ruler until Merneptah, c. 1210 BCE, during the Nineteenth dynasty, \"king\" being the term used most frequently until the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. In the early dynasties, ancient Egyptian kings used to have up to three titles: the Horus, the Sedge and Bee (nswt-bjtj), and the Two Ladies or Nebty (nbtj) name. The Golden Horus as well as the nomen and prenomen titles were added later.","image":"Double_crown.svg.png.webp"}
