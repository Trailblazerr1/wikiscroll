{"title":"Year zero","summary":"A year zero does not exist in the Anno Domini (AD) calendar year system commonly used to number years in the Gregorian calendar (nor in its predecessor, the Julian calendar); in this system, the year 1 BC is followed directly by year AD 1. However, there is a year zero in both the astronomical year numbering system (where it coincides with the Julian year 1 BC), and the ISO 8601:2004 system, the interchange standard for all calendar numbering systems, (where year zero coincides with the Gregorian year 1 BC; see conversion table). There is also a year zero in most Buddhist and Hindu calendars.","image":"Symbol_list_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Year_zero"}
