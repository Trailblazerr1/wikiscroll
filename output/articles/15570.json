{"title":"Extraversion and introversion","summary":"The traits of extraversion (also spelled extroversion) and introversion are a central dimension in some human personality theories. The terms introversion and extraversion were introduced into psychology by Carl Jung,[1] although both the popular understanding and current psychological usage vary. Extraversion tends to be manifested in outgoing, talkative, energetic behavior, whereas introversion is manifested in more reflective and reserved behavior.[2] Jung defined introversion as an \"attitude-type characterised by orientation in life through subjective psychic contents\", and extraversion as \"an attitude-type characterised by concentration of interest on the external object\".[3]","image":"Psi2.svg.png.webp","url":"Extraversion_and_introversion"}
