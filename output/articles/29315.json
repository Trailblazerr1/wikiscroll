{"title":"Memory paging","summary":"In computer operating systems, memory paging is a memory management scheme by which a computer stores and retrieves data from secondary storage[lower-alpha 1] for use in main memory. In this scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementations in modern operating systems, using secondary storage to let programs exceed the size of available physical memory.","image":"Wikisource-logo.svg.png.webp"}
