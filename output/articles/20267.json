{"title":"Hidden Markov model","summary":"Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process — call it \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n — with unobservable (\"hidden\") states. As part of the definition, HMM requires that there be an observable process \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n whose outcomes are \"influenced\" by the outcomes of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n in a known way. Since \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n cannot be observed directly, the goal is to learn about \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n by observing \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y.}\n  \n HMM has an additional requirement that the outcome of \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n at time \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n        =\n        \n          t\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}}\n  \n may be \"influenced\" exclusively by the outcome of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n at \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n        =\n        \n          t\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}}\n  \n and that the outcomes of \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n at \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n        <\n        \n          t\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t<t_{0}}\n  \n must not affect the outcome of \n  \n    \n      \n        Y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Y}\n  \n at \n  \n    \n      \n        t\n        =\n        \n          t\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}.}","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg"}
