{"title":"Hidden Markov model","summary":"Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process — call it X {\\displaystyle X} — with unobservable (\"hidden\") states. As part of the definition, HMM requires that there be an observable process Y {\\displaystyle Y} whose outcomes are \"influenced\" by the outcomes of X {\\displaystyle X} in a known way. Since X {\\displaystyle X} cannot be observed directly, the goal is to learn about X {\\displaystyle X} by observing Y . {\\displaystyle Y.} HMM has an additional requirement that the outcome of Y {\\displaystyle Y} at time t = t 0 {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}} may be \"influenced\" exclusively by the outcome of X {\\displaystyle X} at t = t 0 {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}} and that the outcomes of X {\\displaystyle X} and Y {\\displaystyle Y} at t < t 0 {\\displaystyle t<t_{0}} must not affect the outcome of Y {\\displaystyle Y} at t = t 0 . {\\displaystyle t=t_{0}.}","image":"68baa052181f707c662844a465bfeeb135e82bab.svg","url":"Hidden_Markov_model"}
