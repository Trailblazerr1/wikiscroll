{"title":"New Zealand Government","summary":"The New Zealand Government (Māori: Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa),[8] formally termed Her Majesty's Government,[9] is the central government through which governing authority is exercised in New Zealand. As in most parliamentary democracies, the term \"Government\" refers chiefly to the executive branch, and more specifically to the collective ministry directing the executive.[10] Based on the principle of responsible government, it operates within the framework that \"the Queen reigns, but the government rules, so long as it has the support of the House of Representatives\".[11] The Cabinet Manual describes the main laws, rules and conventions affecting the conduct and operation of the Government.","image":"New_Zealand_Government_wordmark.svg.png.webp","url":"New_Zealand_Government"}
