{"title":"Michelson–Morley experiment","summary":"The Michelson–Morley experiment was an attempt to detect the existence of the luminiferous aether, a supposed medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves. The experiment was performed between April and July 1887 by American physicists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley at what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and published in November of the same year.[1]","image":"Michelson_morley_experiment_1887.jpg.webp","url":"Michelson–Morley_experiment"}
