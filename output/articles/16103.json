{"title":"Field (physics)","summary":"In physics, a field is a physical quantity, represented by a number or another tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time.[1][2][3] For example, on a weather map, the surface temperature is described by assigning a number to each point on the map; the temperature can be considered at a certain point in time or over some interval of time, to study the dynamics of temperature change. A surface wind map,[4] assigning an arrow to each point on a map that describes the wind speed and direction at that point, is an example of a vector field, i.e. a 1-dimensional (rank-1) tensor field. Field theories, mathematical descriptions of how field values change in space and time, are ubiquitous in physics. For instance, the electric field is another rank-1 tensor field, while electrodynamics can be formulated in terms of two interacting vector fields at each point in spacetime, or as a single-rank 2-tensor field.[5][6][7]","image":"VFPt_charges_plus_minus_thumb.svg.png.webp","url":"Field_(physics)"}
