{"title":"B vitamins","summary":"B vitamins are a class of water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism and synthesis of red blood cells.[1] Though these vitamins share similar names (B1, B2, B3, etc.), they are chemically distinct compounds that often coexist in the same foods.[1] In general, dietary supplements containing all eight are referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific number or name of each vitamin, such as B1 for thiamine, B2 for riboflavin, and B3 for niacin.[1] Some are more commonly recognized by name than by number: niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin and folate.","image":"Thiamin.svg.png.webp","url":"B_vitamins"}
