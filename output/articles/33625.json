{"title":"Packet switching","summary":"In telecommunications, packet switching is a method of grouping data  into packets that are transmitted over a digital network. Packets are made of a header and a payload. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination, where the payload is extracted and used by an operating system, application software, or higher layer protocols. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.","image":"Multiplexing_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
