{"title":"Belief","summary":"A belief is an attitude that something is the case, or that some proposition about the world is true.[1] In epistemology, philosophers use the term \"belief\" to refer to attitudes about the world which can be either true or false.[2] To believe something is to take it to be true; for instance, to believe that snow is white is comparable to accepting the truth of the proposition \"snow is white\". However, holding a belief does not require active introspection. For example, few carefully consider whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow, simply assuming that it will. Moreover, beliefs need not be occurrent (e.g. a person actively thinking \"snow is white\"), but can instead be dispositional (e.g. a person who if asked about the color of snow would assert \"snow is white\").[2]","image":"Classical_definition_of_Kno.svg.png.webp"}
