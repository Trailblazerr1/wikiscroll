{"title":"Habitat fragmentation","summary":"Habitat fragmentation describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred environment (habitat), causing population fragmentation and  ecosystem decay. Causes of habitat fragmentation include geological processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment[1] (suspected of being one of the major causes of speciation[1]), and human activity such as land conversion, which can alter the environment much faster and causes the extinction of many species. More specifically, habitat fragmentation is a process by which large and contiguous habitats get divided into smaller, isolated patches of habitats.[2][3]","image":"Deforestation_central_Europe_-_Rodungen_Mitteleuropa.jpg.webp"}
