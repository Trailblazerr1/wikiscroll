Harris and Klebold killed 13 people and wounded 24 others[lower-alpha 2] on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School, where they were seniors, in Columbine, Colorado. After killing most of their victims in the school's library, they later committed suicide. At the time, it was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history,[lower-alpha 3] with the ensuing media frenzy and moral panic leading it to become one of the most infamous mass shootings ever perpetrated in the US.","image":"Eric_Harris.JPG.webp","url":"Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold"}
