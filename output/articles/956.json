{"title":"90th Academy Awards","summary":"The 90th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films of 2017, and took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. The ceremony was held on March 4, 2018, rather than its usual late-February date to avoid conflicting with the 2018 Winter Olympics.[8] During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony, which was televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd and directed by Glenn Weiss.[9][10] Comedian Jimmy Kimmel hosted for the second consecutive year.[11]","image":"2018_Oscars_Official_Poster.png.webp","url":"90th_Academy_Awards"}
