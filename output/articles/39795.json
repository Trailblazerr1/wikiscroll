{"title":"Seagrass","summary":"Seagrasses are the only flowering plants which grow in marine environments. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons).[1] Seagrasses evolved from terrestrial plants which recolonised the ocean 70 to 100 million years ago.","image":"Zostera_marina_-_National_Museum_of_Nature_and_Science%2C_Tokyo_-_DSC07663.JPG.webp"}
