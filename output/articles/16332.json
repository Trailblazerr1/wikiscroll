{"title":"Fission (biology)","summary":"Fission, in biology, is the division of a single entity into two or more parts and the regeneration of those parts to separate entities resembling the original. The object experiencing fission is usually a cell, but the term may also refer to how organisms, bodies, populations, or species split into discrete parts.[1][2][3] The fission may be binary fission, in which a single organism produces two parts, or multiple fission, in which a single entity produces multiple parts.","image":"Bacilli_division_diagram.svg.png.webp"}
