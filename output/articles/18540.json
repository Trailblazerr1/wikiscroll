{"title":"Gospel of John","summary":"The Gospel according to John (Greek: Εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ἰωάννην, romanized: Euangélion katà Iōánnēn, also known as the Gospel of John, or simply John) is the fourth of the four canonical gospels. It contains a highly schematic account of the ministry of Jesus, with seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus (foreshadowing the resurrection of Jesus) and seven \"I am\" discourses (concerned with issues of the church–synagogue debate at the time of composition)[1] culminating in Thomas' proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\".[2] John's account contains Jesus' Farewell Discourse, in which he speaks plainly to his apostles before his crucifixion. The gospel's concluding verses set out its purpose, \"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.\"[3][4]","image":"P46.jpg.webp","url":"Gospel_of_John"}
