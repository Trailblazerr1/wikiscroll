{"title":"German Romanticism","summary":"German Romanticism (German: Deutsche Romantik) was the dominant intellectual movement of German-speaking countries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influencing philosophy, aesthetics, literature and criticism. Compared to English Romanticism, the German variety developed relatively early, and, in the opening years, coincided with Weimar Classicism (1772â€“1805). In contrast to the seriousness of English Romanticism, the German variety of Romanticism notably valued wit, humour, and beauty.","image":"Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Mondaufgang_am_Meer_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp","url":"German_Romanticism"}
