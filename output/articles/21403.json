{"title":"iPad (4th generation)","summary":"The iPad (4th generation)[15] (marketed as iPad with Retina display,[16] colloquially referred to as the iPad 4)[17][18] is a tablet computer produced and marketed by Apple Inc. Compared to its predecessor, the third-generation iPad, the fourth-generation iPad maintained the Retina Display but featured new and upgraded components such as the Apple A6X chip and the Lightning connector, which was introduced on September 12, 2012. It shipped with iOS 6.0, which provides a platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web content. Like the third-generation iPad, it has been supported by five major iOS releases, in this case iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. iOS 11, which was released on 19 September 2017, does not have support for the fourth-generation iPad, because support for older 32 bit iDevices and any iOS 32 bit apps has ended. The iPad 4 is a 32 bit hardware device. The new 64 bit coded iOS 11 only supports newer 64 bit hardware iDevices and 64 bit software, now.","image":"IPad_4_logo_2013.png.webp","url":"IPad_(4th_generation)"}
