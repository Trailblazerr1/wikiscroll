{"title":"Taurus–Littrow","summary":"Taurus–Littrow is a lunar valley located on the near side at the coordinates 20.0°N 31.0°E﻿ / 20.0; 31.0. It served as the landing site for the American Apollo 17 mission in December 1972, the last crewed mission to the Moon.[1][2] The valley is located on the southeastern edge of Mare Serenitatis along a ring of mountains formed between 3.8 and 3.9 billion years ago when a large object impacted the Moon, forming the Serenitatis basin and pushing rock outward and upward. Taurus–Littrow is located in the Taurus mountain range and south of Littrow crater, features from which the valley received its name. The valley's name, coined by the Apollo 17 crew, was approved by the International Astronomical Union in 1973.[1]","image":"Taurus-littrow-valley.jpg.webp","url":"Taurus–Littrow"}
