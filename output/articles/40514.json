{"title":"Shotgun Willie","summary":"Shotgun Willie is the sixteenth studio album by Willie Nelson,\nreleased in 1973. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \"cleared his throat\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA Records in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist.","image":"Shotgun_Willie.jpg.webp"}
