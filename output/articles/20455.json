{"title":"History of Ireland (1536–1691)","summary":"Ireland during the period 1536–1691 saw the first full conquest of the island by England and its colonization with Protestant settlers from Great Britain. This established two central themes in future Irish history: subordination of the country to London-based governments and sectarian animosity between Catholics and Protestants. The period saw Irish society transform from a locally driven, intertribal, clan-based Gaelic structure to a centralised, monarchical, state-governed society, similar to those found elsewhere in Europe. The period is bounded by the dates 1536, when King Henry VIII deposed the FitzGerald dynasty as Lords Deputies of Ireland (the new Kingdom of Ireland was declared by Henry VIII in 1541), and 1691, when the Irish Catholic Jacobites surrendered at Limerick, thus confirming British Protestant dominance in Ireland. This is sometimes called the early modern period.","image":"Atlas_Van_der_Hagen-KW1049B11_048-HIBERNIAE_REGNUM_tam_in_praecipuas_ULTONIAE%2C_CONNACIAE%2C_LAGENIAE%2C_et_MOMONIAE%2C_quam_in_minores_earundem_Provincias%2C_et_Ditiones_subjacentes_peraccuraté_divisum.jpeg.webp","url":"History_of_Ireland_(1536–1691)"}
