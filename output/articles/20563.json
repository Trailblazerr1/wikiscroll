{"title":"History of the Jews in Spain","summary":"While the history of the Jews in the current-day Spanish territory stretches back to Biblical times according to legendary Jewish tradition, the settlement of organised Jewish communities in the Iberian Peninsula possibly traces back to the times after the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD.[1] The earliest archaeological evidence of Hebrew presence in Iberia consists of a 2nd-century gravestone found in MÃ©rida.[2] From the late-6th century onward, following the Visigothic monarchs' conversion from Arianism to the Nicene creed, conditions for Jews in Iberia considerably worsened.[3]","image":"Grande-acedrex.jpg.webp"}
