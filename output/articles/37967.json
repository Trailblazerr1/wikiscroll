{"title":"Right-libertarianism","summary":"Right-libertarianism,[1][2][3][4][5] also known as libertarian capitalism[6] or right-wing libertarianism,[1][7] is a political philosophy and type of libertarianism that supports capitalist property rights and defends market distribution of natural resources and private property.[8] The term right-libertarianism is used to distinguish this class of views on the nature of property and capital[9] from left-libertarianism, a type of libertarianism that combines self-ownership with an egalitarian approach to natural resources.[10] In contrast to socialist libertarianism,[4] right-libertarianism supports free-market capitalism.[1] Like most forms of libertarianism, it supports civil liberties,[1] especially natural law,[11] negative rights,[12] and a major reversal of the modern welfare state.[13]","image":"Capitalismlogo.svg.png.webp"}
