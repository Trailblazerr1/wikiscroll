{"title":"Force majeure","summary":"Force majeure (lit. superior force, with the sense of overwhelming force, from French[1][2]) is a common clause in contracts which essentially frees both parties from liability or obligation when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties, such as a war, strike, riot, crime, epidemic or sudden legal changes prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their obligations under the contract. Explicitly excluded is any event described as an act of God, which covers a separate domain and legally differs, yet it is still related to contract law. In practice, most force majeure clauses do not excuse a party's non-performance entirely but only suspend it for the duration of the force majeure.[3]","image":"ContractLaw.jpg.webp","url":"Force_majeure"}
