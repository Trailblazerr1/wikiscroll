{"title":"Hundred Days' Reform","summary":"The Hundred Days' Reform or Wuxu Reform (traditional Chinese: 戊戌變法; simplified Chinese: 戊戌变法; pinyin: Wùxū Biànfǎ; lit. 'Reform of the Wuxu year') was a failed 103-day national, cultural, political, and educational reform movement that occurred from 11 June to 22 September 1898 during the late Qing dynasty.[1] It was undertaken by the young Guangxu Emperor and his reform-minded supporters. Following the issuing of the reformative edicts, a coup d'état (\"The Coup of 1898\", Wuxu Coup) was perpetrated by powerful conservative opponents led by Empress Dowager Cixi.[2]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
