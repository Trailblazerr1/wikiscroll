{"title":"Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar","summary":"In Norse mythology, Dökkálfar (\"Dark Elves\")[lower-alpha 1] and Ljósálfar (\"Light Elves\")[lower-alpha 2] are two contrasting types of elves; the dark elves dwell within the earth and have a dark complexion, while the light elves live in Álfheimr, and are \"fairer than the sun to look at\". The Ljósálfar and the Dökkálfar are attested in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in the late Old Norse poem Hrafnagaldr Óðins. Scholars have produced theories about the origin and implications of the dualistic concept.","image":"Älvalek.jpg.webp"}
