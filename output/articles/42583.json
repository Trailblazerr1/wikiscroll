{"title":"Subfossil lemur","summary":"Subfossil lemurs are lemurs from Madagascar that are represented by recent (subfossil) remains dating from nearly 26,000 years ago to approximately 560 years ago (from the late Pleistocene until the Holocene).  They include both extant and extinct species, although the term more frequently refers to the extinct giant lemurs.  The diversity of subfossil lemur communities was greater than that of present-day lemur communities, ranging from as high as 20 or more species per location, compared with 10 to 12 species today.  Extinct species are estimated to have ranged in size from slightly over 10 kg (22 lb) to roughly 160 kg (350 lb).  Even the subfossil remains of living species are larger and more robust than the skeletal remains of modern specimens.  The subfossil sites found around most of the island demonstrate that most giant lemurs had wide distributions and that ranges of living species have contracted significantly since the arrival of humans.","image":"Palaeopropithecus_ingens.jpg.webp","url":"Subfossil_lemur"}
