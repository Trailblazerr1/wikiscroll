{"title":"Baldwin Locomotive Works","summary":"The Baldwin Locomotive Works (BLW) was an American manufacturer of railroad locomotives from 1825 to 1951. Originally located in Philadelphia, it moved to nearby Eddystone, Pennsylvania, in the early 20th century. The company was for decades the world's largest producer of steam locomotives, but struggled to compete as demand switched to diesel locomotives. Baldwin produced the last of its 70,000-plus locomotives in 1951, before merging with the Lima-Hamilton Corporation on September 11, 1951 to form the Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corporation.","image":"Philadelphia_and_its_environs%2C_and_the_railroad_scenery_of_Pennsylvania_(1875)_(14572150369).jpg.webp","url":"Baldwin_Locomotive_Works"}
