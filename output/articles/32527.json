{"title":"Nucleotide","summary":"Nucleotides are organic molecules consisting of a nucleoside and a phosphate. They serve as monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers â€“ deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA),  both of which are essential biomolecules within all life-forms on Earth. Nucleotides are obtained in the diet and are also synthesized from common nutrients by the liver.[1]","image":"Hybridogenesis_in_water_frogs_gametes.svg.png.webp"}
