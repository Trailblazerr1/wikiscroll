{"title":"United Kingdomâ€“United States relations","summary":"Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States have ranged from two early wars to competition for world markets. Since 1940 the countries have been close military allies enjoying the Special Relationship built as wartime allies and NATO partners. They are bound together by shared history, an overlap in religion, common language, legal system and kinship ties that reach back hundreds of years, including kindred, ancestral lines among English Americans, Scottish Americans, Welsh Americans, Cornish Americans, Scotch-Irish Americans, Irish Americans, and American Britons. Today, large numbers of expatriates live in both countries.","image":"United_Kingdom_United_States_Locator.svg.png.webp"}
