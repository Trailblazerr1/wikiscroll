{"title":"Satan","summary":"Satan,[lower-alpha 1] also known as the Devil,[lower-alpha 2] and sometimes also called Lucifer in Christianity, is an entity in the Abrahamic religions that seduces humans into sin or falsehood. In Judaism, Satan is seen as an agent subservient to Yahweh, typically regarded as a metaphor for the yetzer hara, or \"evil inclination.\" In Christianity and Islam, he is usually seen as a fallen angel that has rebelled against God, who nevertheless allows him temporary power over the fallen world and a host of demons. In the Quran, Shaitan, also known as Iblis, is an entity made of fire who was cast out of Heaven because he refused to bow before the newly-created Adam and incites humans to sin by infecting their minds with waswƒÅs (\"evil suggestions\").","image":"Codex_Gigas_devil.jpg.webp","url":"Satan"}
