{"title":"Elliptic integral","summary":"In integral calculus, an elliptic integral is one of a number of related functions defined as the value of certain integrals.  Originally, they arose in connection with the problem of finding the arc length of an ellipse and were first studied by Giulio Fagnano and Leonhard Euler (c.â€‰1750).  Modern mathematics defines an \"elliptic integral\" as any function f which can be expressed in the form","image":"066d7c985940c1aa0b4458a9ce2abafe1c3c6fcd.svg","url":"Elliptic_integral"}
