{"title":"American Mafia","summary":"The American Mafia,[3][4][5] commonly referred to in North America as the Italian-American Mafia, the Mafia, or the Mob,[3][4][5] is a highly organized Italian-American criminal society and organized crime group. The organization is often referred to by its members as Cosa Nostra (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkɔːza ˈnɔstra, ˈkɔːsa -], \"our thing\" or “this thing of ours”) and by the American government as La Cosa Nostra (LCN). The organization's name is derived from the original Mafia or Cosa nostra, the Sicilian Mafia, with \"American Mafia\" originally referring simply to Mafia (or Cosa nostra) groups from Sicily operating in America, as the organization initially emerged as an American offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia (known as Cosa nostra by its members).  However, the organization gradually evolved into a separate entity partially independent of the original Mafia in Sicily, and it eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American gangsters and Italian-American crime groups (such as the American Camorra) active in the United States and Canada that were not of Sicilian origin. In North America, it is often colloquially referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other organized crime groups in Italy or ethnic Italian crime groups in other countries.","image":"Paul_Kelly-2.jpg.webp"}
