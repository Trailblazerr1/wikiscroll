{"title":"Random variable","summary":"In probability and statistics, a random variable, random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable is described informally as a variable whose values depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon.[1] The formal mathematical treatment of random variables is a topic in probability theory. In that context, a random variable is understood as a measurable function defined on a probability space that maps from the sample space to the real numbers (or, more generally, to any measurable space[2]).[3]","image":"Random_Variable_as_a_Function-en.svg.png.webp"}
