{"title":"Chondrite","summary":"A chondrite /ˈkɒndraɪt/ is a stony (non-metallic) meteorite that has not been modified, by either melting or differentiation of the parent body.[lower-alpha 1][1] They are formed when various types of dust and small grains in the early Solar System accreted to form primitive asteroids. Some such bodies that are captured in the planet’s gravity well become the most common type of meteorite by (whether quickly, or after many orbits) arriving on a trajectory toward the Earth’s surface. Estimates for their contribution to the total meteorite population vary between 85.7%[2] and 86.2%.[3]","image":"NWA869Meteorite.jpg.webp"}
