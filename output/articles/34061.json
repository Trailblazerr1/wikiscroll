{"title":"Password","summary":"A password, sometimes called a passcode (for example in Apple devices),[1] is secret data, typically a string of characters, usually used to confirm a user's identity.[1] Traditionally, passwords were expected to be memorized, but the large number of password-protected services that a typical individual accesses can make memorization of unique passwords for each service impractical.[2] Using the terminology of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines,[3] the secret is held by a party called the claimant while the party verifying the identity of the claimant is called the verifier. When the claimant successfully demonstrates knowledge of the password to the verifier through an established authentication protocol,[4] the verifier is able to infer the claimant's identity.","image":"Mediawiki_1.25_sign_in_form.png.webp","url":"Password"}
