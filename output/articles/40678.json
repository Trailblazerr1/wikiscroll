{"title":"Silica gel","summary":"Silica gel is an amorphous and porous form of silicon dioxide (silica), consisting of an irregular tridimensional framework of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms with nanometer-scale voids and pores.  The voids may contain water or some other liquids, or may be filled by gas or vacuum.  In the last case, the material is properly called silica xerogel.","image":"Silica_gel_pb092529.jpg.webp"}
