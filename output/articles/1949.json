{"title":"Absolute pitch","summary":"Absolute pitch (AP), often called perfect pitch, is a rare ability of a person to identify or re-create a given musical note without the benefit of a reference tone.[1][2] AP may be demonstrated using linguistic labeling (\"naming\" a note), associating mental imagery with the note, or sensorimotor responses. For example, an AP possessor can accurately reproduce a heard tone on a musical instrument without \"hunting\" for the correct pitch.[3][4]","image":"Music-glissando.svg.png.webp","url":"Absolute_pitch"}
