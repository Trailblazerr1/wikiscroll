{"title":"Surfacing (album)","summary":"Surfacing is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan.  Released in 1997, it was produced by McLachlan's frequent collaborator, Pierre Marchand. McLachlan set about writing Surfacing in 1996, after two and a half years touring for her previous album, 1993's Fumbling Towards Ecstasy. Mentally exhausted, she found it difficult to concentrate on her new album and took six months off in Vancouver. After that she completed the ten songs for the album and went to Marchand's Quebec studio to record.","image":"Sarahmclachlansurfacing.PNG.webp"}
