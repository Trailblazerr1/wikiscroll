{"title":"Eris (dwarf planet)","summary":"Eris (minor-planet designation 136199 Eris) is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. Eris is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO), has a high-eccentricity orbit, and is a member of the scattered disk. Eris was discovered in January 2005 by a Palomar Observatory-based team led by Mike Brown, and its discovery was verified later that year. In September 2006 it was named after the Greco-Roman goddess of strife and discord. Eris is the ninth-most massive known object orbiting the Sun, and the sixteenth-most massive overall in the Solar System (including moons). It is also the largest object that has not been visited by a spacecraft. Eris has been measured at 2,326 ± 12 kilometers (1,445 ± 7 mi) in diameter.[11] Its mass is 0.27 percent that of the Earth and 127 percent that of dwarf planet Pluto,[20][21] though Pluto is slightly larger by volume.[22] As Eris orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 25.9 hours, making its day length similar to Earth's.[23] However, other sources disagree on the rotation period.[24]","image":"Eris_symbol_(Moskowitz%2C_fixed_width).svg.png.webp","url":"Eris_(dwarf_planet)"}
