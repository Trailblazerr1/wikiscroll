{"title":"National Register of Historic Places property types","summary":"The U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) classifies its listings by various types of properties. Listed properties generally fall into one of five categories, though there are special considerations for other types of properties which do not fit into these five broad categories or fit into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for NRHP properties are: building, district, object, site, and structure.","image":"National_Register_of_Historic_Places_Property_types_collage_2.jpg.webp"}
