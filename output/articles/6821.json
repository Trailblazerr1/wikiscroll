{"title":"Black War","summary":"The Black War was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Australians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832. The conflict, fought largely as a guerrilla war by both sides, claimed the lives of 600 to 900 Aboriginal people and more than 200 European colonists, nearly annihilating the island's indigenous population.[2][3] The near-destruction of the Aboriginal Tasmanians, and the frequent incidence of mass killings, has sparked debate among historians over whether the Black War should be defined as an act of genocide.[4]","image":"Benjamin_Duterrau_-_Timmy%2C_a_Tasmanian_Aboriginal%2C_throwing_a_spear_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg.webp"}
