{"title":"Katamari Damacy","summary":"Katamari Damacy[lower-alpha 1] (lit.â€‰'Clump Spirit') is a third-person puzzle-action video game developed and published by Namco for the PlayStation 2. It was released in Japan in March 2004 and in North America in September 2004. Designer Keita Takahashi struggled to pitch the game to Namco's superiors, eventually seeking student aid from the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory to develop the project for less than US$ 1 million. As director, Takahashi emphasized concepts of novelty, ease of understanding and enjoyment.","image":"KatamariDamacybox.jpg.webp"}
