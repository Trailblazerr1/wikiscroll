{"title":"Type (biology)","summary":"In biology, a type is a particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular taxon. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.[1]","image":"Marocaster_coronatus_MHNT.PAL.2010.2.2_(Close_up).jpg.webp","url":"Type_(biology)"}
