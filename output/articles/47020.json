{"title":"Vacuum permeability","summary":"Vacuum permeability is the magnetic permeability in a classical vacuum. Vacuum permeability  is derived from production of a magnetic field by an electric current or by a moving electric charge and in all other formulas for magnetic-field production in a vacuum. The physical constant μ0, (pronounced \"mu nought\" or \"mu zero\") is commonly called the vacuum permeability, the permeability of free space, the permeability of vacuum, or the magnetic constant. Since the redefinition of SI units in 2019, μ0 is no longer a defined constant (per the former definition of the SI ampere), but rather needs to be determined experimentally.","image":"953205e9843609a3a4804564fdcddcaf8c6c3135.svg","url":"Vacuum_permeability"}
