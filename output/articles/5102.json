{"title":"Aviva Stadium","summary":"Aviva Stadium (also known as Lansdowne Road or Ireland's stadium; Irish: Staid Aviva)[9] is a sports stadium located in Dublin, Ireland, with a capacity for 51,700 spectators (all seated).[10][11] It is built on the site of the former Lansdowne Road Stadium, which was demolished in 2007, and replacing it as home to its chief tenants: the Irish rugby union team and the Republic of Ireland football team. The decision to redevelop the stadium came after plans for both Stadium Ireland and Eircom Park fell through. Aviva Group Ireland signed a 10-year deal for the naming rights in 2009.[12]","image":"Aviva_Stadium.svg.png.webp","url":"Aviva_Stadium"}
