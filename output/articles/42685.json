{"title":"Sulfur cycle","summary":"The sulfur cycle is biogeochemical cycle in which the sulfur moves between rocks, waterways and living systems. It is important in geology as it affects many minerals and in life because sulfur is an essential element (CHNOPS), being a constituent of many proteins and cofactors, and sulfur compounds can be used as oxidants or reductants in microbial respiration.[1] The global sulfur cycle involves the transformations of sulfur species through different oxidation states, which play an important role in both geological and biological processes.\nSteps of the sulfur cycle are:","image":"Sulfur_cycle_-_English.jpg.webp"}
