{"title":"Odin","summary":"Odin (/ˈoʊdɪn/;[1] from Old Norse: Óðinn, IPA: [ˈoːðenː]) is a widely revered god in Germanic mythology. Norse mythology, the source of most surviving information about him, associates him with wisdom, healing, death, royalty, the gallows, knowledge, war, battle, victory, sorcery, poetry, frenzy, and the runic alphabet, and depicts him as the husband of the goddess Frigg. In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, the god was known in Old English as Wōden, in Old Saxon as Wōdan, in Old Dutch as Wuodan, and in Old High German as Wuotan, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Wōđanaz, meaning 'lord of frenzy', or 'leader of the possessed'.","image":"Georg_von_Rosen_-_Oden_som_vandringsman%2C_1886_(Odin%2C_the_Wanderer).jpg.webp","url":"Odin"}
