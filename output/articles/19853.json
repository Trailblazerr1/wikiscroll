{"title":"Healthcare in Israel","summary":"Healthcare in Israel is universal and participation in a medical insurance plan is compulsory. All Israeli residents are entitled to basic health care as a fundamental right. The Israeli healthcare system is based on the National Health Insurance Law of 1995, which mandates all citizens resident in the country to join one of four official health insurance organizations, known as Kupat Holim (קופת חולים - \"Sick Funds\") which are run as not-for-profit organizations and are prohibited by law from denying any Israeli resident membership. Israelis can increase their medical coverage and improve their options by purchasing private health insurance.[1] In a survey of 48 countries in 2013, Israel's health system was ranked fourth in the world in terms of efficiency, and in 2014 it ranked seventh out of 51.[2] In 2020, Israel's health system was ranked third most efficient in the world.[3] In 2015, Israel was ranked sixth-healthiest country in the world by Bloomberg rankings[4] and ranked eighth in terms of life expectancy.","image":"PTBeilinson.jpg.webp","url":"Healthcare_in_Israel"}
