{"title":"Oxygen therapy","summary":"Oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen, is the use of oxygen as medical treatment.[1] Acute indications for therapy include hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels), carbon monoxide toxicity and cluster headache. It may also be prophylactically given to maintain blood oxygen levels during the induction of anesthesia.[2] Oxygen therapy is often useful in chronic hypoxemia caused by conditions such as severe COPD or cystic fibrosis.[3][1] Oxygen can be delivered via nasal cannula or face mask, or via high pressure conditions such as in endotracheal intubation or hyperbaric chamber.[4][5] It can also be given through bypassing the airway, such as in ECMO therapy.","image":"Simple_face_mask.jpg.webp"}
