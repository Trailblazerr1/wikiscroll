{"title":"White tie","summary":"White tie, also called full evening dress or a dress suit, is the most formal in traditional evening western dress codes.[1] For men, it consists of a black tail coat (alternatively referred to as a dress coat, usually by tailors) worn over a white shirt, white piqué waistcoat and the eponymous white bow tie worn around a standing wing collar. Mid or high-waisted black trousers with galon, a trim one with two silk stripes that conceal the outer seams of the trousers, along with black highly polished or patent leather oxford or optionally court shoes, complete the outfit. Orders, decorations and medals may be worn. Acceptable accessories include a black top hat, white gloves, a white scarf, a pocket watch, a white pocket square, and a boutonnière. Women wear full-length ball or evening gowns with evening gloves and, optionally, tiaras, jewellery, and a small handbag. Some white-tie functions also request that the women wear long gloves past the elbow.[2]","image":"Wallace_Reid_in_Picture-Play_Magazine.jpg.webp"}
