{"title":"Wells, Somerset","summary":"Wells (/wɛlz/)[2] is a city and civil parish in the Mendip district of Somerset, located on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills, 21 miles (34 km) south-east of Weston-super-Mare, 22 miles (35 km) south-west of Bath and 23 miles (37 km) south of Bristol. Although the population recorded in the 2011 census was only 10,536,[3] (increased to 12,000 by 2018) and with a built-up area of just 3.244 square kilometres,[4] Wells has had city status since medieval times, because of the presence of Wells Cathedral. Often described as England's smallest city,[5][6] it is actually second smallest to the City of London in area and population, but unlike London it is not part of a larger urban agglomeration.","image":"Aerial_view_of_Wells.jpg.webp","url":"Wells,_Somerset"}
