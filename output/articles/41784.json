{"title":"Sponge","summary":"Sponges, the members of the phylum Porifera (/pəˈrɪfərə/; meaning 'pore bearer'), are a basal animal clade as a sister of the Diploblasts.[3][4][5][6][7] They are multicellular organisms that have bodies full of pores and channels allowing water to circulate through them, consisting of jelly-like mesohyl sandwiched between two thin layers of cells. The branch of zoology that studies sponges is known as spongiology.[8]","image":"Aplysina_archeri_(Stove-pipe_Sponge-pink_variation).jpg.webp","url":"Sponge"}
