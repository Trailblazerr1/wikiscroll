{"title":"Las Meninas","summary":"Las Meninas[lower-alpha 1] (pronounced [laz meˈninas]; Spanish for 'The Ladies-in-waiting') is a 1656 painting in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting.","image":"Las_Meninas%2C_by_Diego_Velázquez%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg.webp"}
