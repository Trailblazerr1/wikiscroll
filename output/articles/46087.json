{"title":"Tryptophan","summary":"Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W)[3] is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a non-polar aromatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning that the body cannot synthesize it and it must be obtained from the diet. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3.[4] It is encoded by the codon UGG.","image":"L-Tryptophan_-_L-Tryptophan.svg.png.webp","url":"Tryptophan"}
