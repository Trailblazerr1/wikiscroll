{"title":"Mormons","summary":"Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually coalesced into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. (Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\".) People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to other denominations.","image":"Salt_Lake_Temple%2C_Utah_-_Sept_2004-2.jpg.webp"}
