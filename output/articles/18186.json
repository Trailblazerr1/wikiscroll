{"title":"Glassblowing","summary":"Glassblowing is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or gaffer. A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.","image":"Glassblowers_at_work%2C_Crown_Crystal%2C_1950%2C_by_Crown_Crystal_Studio_(4442231204).jpg.webp"}
