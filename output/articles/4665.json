{"title":"Assassin's Creed Origins","summary":"Assassin's Creed Origins is a 2017 action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the tenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series. Principally set in Egypt, near the end of the Ptolemaic period (49–43 BC), the story follows a Medjay named Bayek of Siwa and his wife Aya, and explores the origins of the millennia-long conflict between the Hidden Ones—forerunners to the Assassin Brotherhood—who fight for peace by promoting liberty, and The Order of the Ancients—forerunners to the Templar Order—who desire peace through the forced imposition of order. The narrative also includes sequences set during the 21st century, which follow a new character, Layla Hassan. Featuring a large open world, Origins adopted elements from role-playing video games and incorporated an overhauled \"hitbox-based\" combat system.","image":"Assassin's_Creed_Origins_Cover_Art.png.webp","url":"Assassin's_Creed_Origins"}
