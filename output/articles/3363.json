{"title":"Ammonoidea","summary":"Ammonoids are a group of extinct marine mollusc animals in the subclass Ammonoidea of the class Cephalopoda. These molluscs, commonly referred to as ammonites, are more closely related to living coleoids (i.e., octopuses, squid and cuttlefish) than they are to shelled nautiloids such as the living Nautilus species.[1] The earliest ammonites appeared during the Devonian, and the last species either vanished in the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event, or shortly after during the Danian epoch of the Paleocene.","image":"Pleuroceras_solare%2C_Little_Switzerland%2C_Bavaria%2C_Germany.jpg.webp"}
