{"title":"Heterosis","summary":"Heterosis, hybrid vigor, or outbreeding enhancement is the improved or increased function of any biological quality in a hybrid offspring. An offspring is heterotic if its traits are enhanced as a result of mixing the genetic contributions of its parents. These effects can be due to Mendelian or non-Mendelian inheritance.","image":"Time_course_imaging_of_two_maize_inbreds_LH198_and_PHG47_and_their_F1_hybrid.gif"}
