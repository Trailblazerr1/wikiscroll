{"title":"225088 Gonggong","summary":"Gonggong (225088 Gonggong or provisional designation: 2007 OR10) is a dwarf planet, a member of the scattered disc beyond Neptune. It has a highly eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 34–101 astronomical units (5.1–15.1 billion kilometers; 3.2–9.4 billion miles) from the Sun. As of 2019, its distance from the Sun is 88 AU (13.2×10^9 km; 8.2×10^9 mi), and it is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object. Gonggong is in a 3:10 orbital resonance with Neptune, in which it completes three orbits around the Sun for every ten orbits completed by Neptune. Gonggong was discovered in July 2007 by American astronomers Megan Schwamb, Michael Brown, and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, and the discovery was announced in January 2009.","image":"Gonggong_symbol_(Moskowitz%2C_fixed_width).svg.png.webp","url":"225088_Gonggong"}
