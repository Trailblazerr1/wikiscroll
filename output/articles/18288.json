{"title":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase","summary":"Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (abbreviated GAPDH) (EC 1.2.1.12) is an enzyme of about 37kDa that catalyzes the sixth step of glycolysis and thus serves to break down glucose for energy and carbon molecules. In addition to this long established metabolic function, GAPDH has recently been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation, initiation of apoptosis,[4] ER to Golgi vesicle shuttling, and fast axonal, or axoplasmic transport.[5] In sperm, a testis-specific isoenzyme GAPDHS is expressed.","image":"GAPDH_with_labels.png.webp","url":"Glyceraldehyde_3-phosphate_dehydrogenase"}
