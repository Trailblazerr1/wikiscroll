{"title":"History of music","summary":"The history of music covers the historical development and presence of music from prehistoric times to present day. Though definitions of music vary wildly throughout the world,[1] every known culture partakes in it, and music is thus considered a cultural universal.[2][3] The origins of music remain highly contentious; commentators often relate it to the origin of language, with much disagreement surrounding whether music arose before, after or simultaneously with language. Many other theories exist, having been proposed by scholars from a wide range of disciplines, though none have achieved wide approval. Most cultures have their own mythical origins concerning the invention of music, generally rooted in their respective mythological, religious or philosophical beliefs.","image":"lossy-page1-162px-Seikilos1.tif.jpg.webp"}
