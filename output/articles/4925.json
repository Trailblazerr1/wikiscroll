{"title":"Augustin-Jean Fresnel","summary":"Augustin-Jean Fresnel (/ˈfreɪnɛl, -nəl/ FRAY-nel, -⁠nəl; /ˈfrɛnɛl, -əl/ FREN-el, -⁠əl; or /freɪˈnɛl/ fray-NEL;[1] French: [oɡystɛ̃ ʒɑ̃ fʁɛnɛl];[2] 10 May 1788 – 14 July 1827) was a French civil engineer and physicist whose research in optics led to the almost unanimous acceptance of the wave theory of light, excluding any remnant of Newton's corpuscular theory, from the late 1830s [3] until the end of the 19th century. He is perhaps better known for inventing the catadioptric (reflective/refractive) Fresnel lens and for pioneering the use of \"stepped\" lenses to extend the visibility of lighthouses, saving countless lives at sea. The simpler dioptric (purely refractive) stepped lens, first proposed by Count Buffon [4] and independently reinvented by Fresnel, is used in screen magnifiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projectors.","image":"Augustin_Fresnel.jpg.webp","url":"Augustin-Jean_Fresnel"}
