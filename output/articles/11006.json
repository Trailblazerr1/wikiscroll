{"title":"Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran","summary":"The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran[1][2] (Persian: قانون اساسی جمهوری اسلامی ایران‎, Qanun-e Asasi-ye Jimhuri-ye Eslâmi-ye Iran) was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979,[3][4] and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1906.[5] It has been amended once, on 28 July 1989.[6] The constitution has been called a \"hybrid\" of \"theocratic and democratic elements\". Articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God; but article Six \"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\"[7] However, main democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112).[7][8]","image":"Emblem_of_Iran.svg.png.webp","url":"Constitution_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"}
