{"title":"Sundown town","summary":"Sundown towns, also known as sunset towns, gray towns, or sundowner towns, are all-white municipalities or neighborhoods in the United States that practice a form of racial segregation by excluding non-whites via some combination of discriminatory local laws, intimidation or violence. Entire sundown counties[1] and sundown suburbs were also created by the same process. The term came from signs posted that \"colored people\" had to leave town by sundown.[2] The practice was not restricted to the southern states, as \"at least until the early 1960s...northern states could be nearly as inhospitable to black travelers as states like Alabama or Georgia.\"[3]","image":"ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg.webp","url":"Sundown_town"}
