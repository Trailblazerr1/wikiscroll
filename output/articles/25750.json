{"title":"Leatherback sea turtle","summary":"The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), sometimes called the lute turtle or leathery turtle or simply the luth, is the largest of all living turtles and the heaviest non-crocodilian reptile, reaching lengths of up to 2 metres and weights of 600 kg.[5][6] It is the only living species in the genus Dermochelys and family Dermochelyidae. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell; instead, its carapace is covered by oily flesh and flexible, leather-like skin, for which it is named.[7]","image":"Leatherback_sea_turtle_Tinglar%2C_USVI_(5839996547).jpg.webp","url":"Leatherback_sea_turtle"}
