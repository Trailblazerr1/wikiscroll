{"title":"Neoplasm","summary":"A neoplasm (/ˈniːoʊplæzəm, ˈniə-/[1]) is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. The process that occurs to form or produce a neoplasm is called neoplasia. The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed.[2][3][4] This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, when it may be called a tumor.[5]","image":"Colon_cancer_2.jpg.webp"}
