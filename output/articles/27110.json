{"title":"Littoral zone","summary":"The littoral zone or nearshore is the part of a sea, lake, or river that is close to the shore.[1] In coastal environments, the littoral zone extends from the high water mark, which is rarely inundated, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. The littoral zone always includes this intertidal zone, and the terms are often used interchangeably. However, the meaning of littoral zone can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.","image":"Littoral_Zones.jpg.webp","url":"Littoral_zone"}
