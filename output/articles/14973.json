{"title":"Epilepsy","summary":"Epilepsy is a group of non-communicable neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures.[10][11][12] Epileptic seizures can vary from brief and nearly undetectable periods to long periods of vigorous shaking due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.[1] These episodes can result in physical injuries, either directly such as broken bones or through causing accidents.[1] In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and may have no immediate underlying cause.[10] Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy.[13] People with epilepsy may be treated differently in various areas of the world and experience varying degrees of social stigma due to their condition.[1]","image":"Spike-waves.png.webp","url":"Epilepsy"}
