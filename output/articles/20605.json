{"title":"Hitting for the cycle","summary":"In baseball, hitting for the cycle is the accomplishment of one batter who hits a single, a double, a triple, and a home run in the same game. Collecting the hits in that order is known as a \"natural cycle\".[1] Cycles are rare in Major League Baseball (MLB), having occurred only 334 times, starting with Curry Foley in 1882.[2][3] The most recent cycle was accomplished by Eddie Rosario of the Atlanta Braves on September 19, 2021, against the San Francisco Giants.[4]","image":"Curry_Foley_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Hitting_for_the_cycle"}
