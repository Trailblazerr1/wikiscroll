{"title":"Eärendil and Elwing","summary":"Eärendil the Mariner (pronounced [ɛaˈrɛndil]) and his wife Elwing are fictional characters in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium. They are depicted in The Silmarillion as Half-elven, the children of Men and Elves. He is a great seafarer who, on his brow, carried the morning star, a jewel called a Silmaril, across the sky. The jewel had been saved by Elwing from the destruction of the Havens of Sirion. Tolkien took his name from the Old English Earendel, found in the poem Crist A, which hailed him as \"brightest of angels\". Elwing is the granddaughter of Lúthien and Beren, and is descended from Melian the Maia. Through their progeny, Eärendil and Elwing became the ancestors of the Númenorean, and later Dúnedain, royal bloodline.","image":"Phial_of_Galadriel.jpg.webp","url":"Eärendil_and_Elwing"}
