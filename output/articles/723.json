{"title":"2018 vote of no confidence in the government of Mariano Rajoy","summary":"A motion of no confidence in the Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy was debated and voted in the Congress of Deputies between 31 May and 1 June 2018. It was brought by Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) leader Pedro Sánchez after the governing People's Party (PP) was found to have profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the Gürtel case in a court ruling made public the previous day. This was the fourth motion of no confidence since the Spanish transition to democracy and the first one to be successful,[1] as well the second to be submitted against Mariano Rajoy after the Unidos Podemos's one the previous year.[2][3] Coincidentally, it was held 38 years after the first such vote of no confidence in Spain on 30 May 1980.","image":"Mariano_Rajoy_felicita_al_nuevo_presidente_del_Gobierno_Pedro_Sánchez_(2018-06-01).jpg.webp"}
