{"title":"Freedom Riders","summary":"Freedom Riders were civil rights activists who rode interstate buses into the segregated Southern United States in 1961 and subsequent years to challenge the non-enforcement of the United States Supreme Court decisions Morgan v. Virginia (1946) and Boynton v. Virginia (1960), which ruled that segregated public buses were unconstitutional.[3] The Southern states had ignored the rulings and the federal government did nothing to enforce them. The first Freedom Ride left Washington, D.C. on May 4, 1961,[4] and was scheduled to arrive in New Orleans on May 17.[5]","image":"Exhibit_on_Freedom_Riders_-_Center_for_Civil_and_Human_Rights_-_Atlanta_-_Georgia_-_USA_(33468216774).jpg.webp","url":"Freedom_Riders"}
