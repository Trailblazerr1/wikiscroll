{"title":"Cernunnos","summary":"In Gallo-Roman religion, Cernunnos was a deity depicted with antlers, seated cross-legged, and is associated with stags, horned serpents, dogs, bulls, and rats. He is usually holding or wearing a torc and has been seen holding a bag of coins (or grain) and a cornucopia.[1]  Believed to have originally been a Celtic deity, over 50 examples have been found from this time believed to be associated with him, concentrating in the north-eastern region of what was called Gaul by the ancient Romans.  Cernunnos is also associated with the Wiccan Horned God in the modern religious tradition of Wicca.","image":"Gundestrupkedlen-_00054_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Cernunnos"}
