{"title":"Nucleophile","summary":"In chemistry, a nucleophile is a chemical species that forms bonds with electrophiles by donating an electron pair. All molecules and ions with a free pair of electrons or at least one pi bond can act as nucleophiles. Because nucleophiles donate electrons, they are Lewis bases.","image":"f64a4ccc972af2f0f90725169af1c36c88b5de60.svg"}
