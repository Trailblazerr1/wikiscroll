{"title":"Black Monday (1987)","summary":"Black Monday is the name commonly given to the global, sudden, severe, and largely unexpected[1] stock market crash on October 19, 1987. In Australia and New Zealand, the day is also referred to as Black Tuesday because of the time zone difference from other English-speaking countries. All of the twenty-three major world markets experienced a sharp decline in October 1987. When measured in United States dollars, eight markets declined by 20 to 29%, three by 30 to 39% (Malaysia, Mexico and New Zealand), and three by more than 40% (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore).[2][upper-alpha 1] The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4%) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8%. Out of twenty-three major industrial countries, nineteen had a decline greater than 20%.[4] Worldwide losses were estimated at US$1.71 trillion.[5] The severity of the crash sparked fears of extended economic instability[6] or even a reprise of the Great Depression.[7]","image":"Black_Monday_Dow_Jones.svg.png.webp"}
