{"title":"Submarine","summary":"A submarine (or sub) is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. It differs from a submersible, which has more limited underwater capability. It is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots, as well as medium-sized or smaller vessels, such as the midget submarine and the wet sub.  Submarines are referred to as \"boats\" rather than \"ships\" irrespective of their size.[1]","image":"US_Navy_040730-N-1234E-002_PCU_Virginia_(SSN_774)_returns_to_the_General_Dynamics_Electric_Boat_shipyard.jpg.webp","url":"Submarine"}
