{"title":"Intrusion detection system","summary":"An intrusion detection system (IDS; also intrusion protection system or IPS) is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.[1] Any intrusion activity or violation is typically reported either to an administrator or collected centrally using a security information and event management (SIEM) system. A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms.[2]","image":"Information_Security_Incidents_by_Category%2C_Fiscal_Year_2014.svg.png.webp","url":"Intrusion_detection_system"}
