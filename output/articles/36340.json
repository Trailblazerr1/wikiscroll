{"title":"Proton–proton chain","summary":"The proton–proton chain, also commonly referred to as the p–p chain, is one of two known sets of nuclear fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium. It dominates in stars with masses less than or equal to that of the Sun,[2] whereas the CNO cycle, the other known reaction, is suggested by theoretical models to dominate in stars with masses greater than about 1.3 times that of the Sun.[3]","image":"Nuclear_energy_generation.svg.png.webp","url":"Proton–proton_chain"}
