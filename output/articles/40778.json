{"title":"Sine wave","summary":"A sine wave or sinusoid is any of certain mathematical curves that describe a smooth periodic oscillation. A sine wave is a continuous wave.  It is named after the function sine, of which it is the graph. It occurs often in both pure and applied mathematics, as well as physics, engineering, signal processing and many other fields. Its most basic form as a function of time (t) is:","image":"6c7ac13130e7d34a143d729920378bb1902ce74f.svg","url":"Sine_wave"}
