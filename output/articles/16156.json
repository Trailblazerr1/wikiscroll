{"title":"Fin de siècle","summary":"Fin de siècle (French: [fɛ̃ də sjɛkl]) is a French term meaning \"end of century\", a term which typically encompasses both the meaning of the similar English idiom turn of the century and also makes reference to the closing of one era and onset of another. The term is typically used to refer to the end of the 19th century. This period was widely thought to be a period of social degeneracy, but at the same time a period of hope for a new beginning.[1] The \"spirit\" of fin de siècle often refers to the cultural hallmarks that were recognized as prominent in the 1880s and 1890s, including ennui, cynicism, pessimism, and \"...a widespread belief that civilization leads to decadence.\"[2][3]","image":"Bilan_fin_de_siècle.jpg.webp","url":"Fin_de_siècle"}
