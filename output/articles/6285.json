Its aims included inspiring youth and promoting careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and landing its magnetometer, time capsule, and laser retroreflector on the Moon. The lander's gyroscopes failed on 11 April 2019 causing the main engine to shut off, which resulted in the lander crashing on the Moon.[9] Its final resting position is 32.5956°N, 19.3496°E.[10]","image":"Beresheet_model_on_Habima_Square_20190222_01.jpg.webp","url":"Beresheet"}
