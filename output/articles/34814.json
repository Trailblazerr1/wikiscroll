{"title":"Philosophical skepticism","summary":"Philosophical skepticism (UK spelling: scepticism; from Greek σκέψις skepsis, \"inquiry\") is a family of philosophical views that question the possibility of knowledge.[1][2] Philosophical skeptics are often classified into two general categories: Those who deny all possibility of knowledge, and those who advocate for the suspension of judgment due to the inadequacy of evidence.[3] This distinction is modeled after the differences between the Academic skeptics and the Pyrrhonian skeptics in ancient Greek philosophy.","image":"Philosopher%2C_marble_head%2C_Roman_copy%2C_AM_Corfu%2C_Krfm22.jpg.webp","url":"Philosophical_skepticism"}
