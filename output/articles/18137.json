It is traditionally considered to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. However, the existence of up to nine extant giraffe species has been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa. Seven other prehistoric species, known from fossils, are extinct.","image":"Giraffe_Mikumi_National_Park.jpg.webp"}
