{"title":"Inner Hebrides","summary":"The Inner Hebrides (/ˈhɛbrɪdiːz/; Scottish Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan a-staigh, \"the inner isles\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than 30 hectares (74 acres). Skye, Mull, and Islay are the three largest, and also have the highest populations. The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about 4,130 km2 (1,594 sq mi), and had a population of 18,948 in 2011.[1][2]  The population density is therefore about 4.6 inhabitants per square kilometre (12 inhabitants per square mile).","image":"Inner_Hebrides.png.webp"}
