{"title":"Video game console","summary":"A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image to display a video game that can be played with a game controller. These may be home consoles which are generally placed in a permanent location connected to a television or other display device and controlled with a separate game controller, or handheld consoles that include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit and can be played anywhere. Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles.","image":"Gaming_Section_1_-_Retrosystems_2010.jpg.webp","url":"Video_game_console"}
