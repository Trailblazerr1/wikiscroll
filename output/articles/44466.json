{"title":"The Open Boat","summary":"\"The Open Boat\" is a short story by American author Stephen Crane (1871â€“1900). First published in 1897, it was based on Crane's experience of surviving a shipwreck off the coast of Florida earlier that year while traveling to Cuba to work as a newspaper correspondent. Crane was stranded at sea for thirty hours when his ship, the SS Commodore, sank after hitting a sandbar. He and three other men were forced to navigate their way to shore in a small boat; one of the men, an oiler named Billie Higgins, drowned after the boat overturned. Crane's personal account of the shipwreck and the men's survival, titled \"Stephen Crane's Own Story\", was first published a few days after his rescue.","image":"TheOpenBoat.jpg.webp"}
