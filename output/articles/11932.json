{"title":"Daeva","summary":"A daeva (Avestan: 𐬛𐬀𐬉𐬎𐬎𐬀 daēuua, Sanskrit: देव deva) is a Zoroastrian supernatural entity with disagreeable characteristics. In the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Zoroastrian canon, the daevas are \"gods that are (to be) rejected\". This meaning is – subject to interpretation – perhaps also evident in the Old Persian \"daiva inscription\" of the 5th century BCE. In the Younger Avesta, the daevas are divinities that promote chaos and disorder. In later tradition and folklore, the dēws (Zoroastrian Middle Persian; New Persian divs) are personifications of every imaginable evil.","image":"ZoroastrianismSymbolWhite.PNG.webp"}
