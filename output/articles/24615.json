{"title":"Kenzō Tange","summary":"Kenzō Tange (丹下 健三, Tange Kenzō, 4 September 1913 – 22 March 2005)[1] was a Japanese architect, and winner of the 1987 Pritzker Prize for architecture. He was one of the most significant architects of the 20th century, combining traditional Japanese styles with modernism, and designed major buildings on five continents. His career spanned the entire second half of the twentieth century, producing numerous distinctive buildings in Tokyo, other Japanese cities and cities around the world, as well as ambitious physical plans for Tokyo and its environs.[2]  Tange was also an influential patron of the Metabolist movement. He said: \"It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call structuralism\", (cited in Plan 2/1982, Amsterdam), a reference to the architectural movement known as Dutch Structuralism.","image":"Kenzo_Tange_1981.jpg.webp","url":"Kenzō_Tange"}
