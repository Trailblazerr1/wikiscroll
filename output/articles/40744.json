{"title":"Simple eye in invertebrates","summary":"A simple eye (sometimes called a pigment pit[1][2]) refers to a form of eye or an optical arrangement composed of a single lens and without an elaborate retina such as occurs in most vertebrates. In this sense \"simple eye\" is distinct from a multi-lensed \"compound eye\", and is not necessarily at all simple in the usual sense of the word.","image":"Polistes_ocelli.jpg.webp"}
