{"title":"Statelessness","summary":"In international law, a stateless person is someone who is \"not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law\".[3] Some stateless people are also refugees. However, not all refugees are stateless, and many people who are stateless have never crossed an international border.[4] On November 12, 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stated there are about 12 million stateless people in the world.","image":"World_Citizen_Symbol.svg.png.webp"}
