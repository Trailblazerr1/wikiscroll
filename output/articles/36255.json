{"title":"Propeller","summary":"A propeller is a device with a rotating hub and radiating blades that are set at a pitch to form a helical spiral, that, when rotated, exerts linear thrust upon a working fluid, such as water or air.[1]  Propellers are used to pump fluid through a pipe or duct, or to create thrust to propel a boat through water or an aircraft through air.  The blades are specially shaped so that their rotational motion through the fluid causes a pressure difference between the two surfaces of the blade by Bernoulli's principle which exerts force on the fluid.[2] Most marine propellers are screw propellers with helical blades rotating on a propeller shaft with an approximately horizontal axis.[3]","image":"Ship-propeller_2000.jpg.webp","url":"Propeller"}
