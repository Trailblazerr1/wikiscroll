{"title":"Mariel boatlift","summary":"The Mariel boatlift was a mass emigration of Cubans, who traveled from Cuba's Mariel Harbor to the United States between 15 April and 31 October 1980. The term \"Marielito\" (plural \"Marielitos\") is used to refer to these refugees in both Spanish and English. While the exodus was triggered by a sharp downturn in the Cuban economy, it followed on the heels of generations of Cubans who had emigrated to the United States in the preceding decades.","image":"Mariel_Refugees.jpg.webp"}
