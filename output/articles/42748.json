It is the opening track from their 1983 album War and was released as the album's third single on 21 March 1983 in the Netherlands and West Germany.[3] \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies.[4] One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the 1972 Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot and killed unarmed civil rights protesters. Along with \"New Year's Day\", the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well received by critics on the album's release.[5][6]","image":"U2_Sunday_Bloody_Sunday.png.webp"}
