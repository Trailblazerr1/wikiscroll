{"title":"Execution (computing)","summary":"Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or  virtual machine reads and acts on the instructions of a computer program.  Each instruction of a program is a description of a particular action which must be carried out, in order for a specific problem to be solved. Execution involves repeatedly following a 'fetch–decode–execute' cycle for each instruction. As the executing machine follows the instructions, specific effects are produced in accordance with the semantics of those instructions.","image":"Fetch-Decode-Execute_Cycle.png.webp"}
