{"title":"Shropshire","summary":"Shropshire (/ˈʃrɒpʃər, -ʃɪər/; alternatively Salop;[3] abbreviated in print only as Shrops; demonym Salopian /səˈloʊpiən/ sə-LOH-pee-ən)[4] is a landlocked historic county in the West Midlands region of England. It is bordered by Wales to the west and the English counties of Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the southeast, and Herefordshire to the south. A unitary authority of the same name was created in 2009, taking over from the previous county council and five district councils, now governed by Shropshire Council. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998, but remains part of the ceremonial county.","image":"Flag_of_Shropshire.svg.png.webp","url":"Shropshire"}
