{"title":"Communist Party of the Soviet Union","summary":"The Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU),[lower-alpha 1] at some points known as the Russian Communist Party or All-Union Communist Party and sometimes referred to as the Soviet Communist Party (SCP), was the founding and ruling political party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU was the sole governing party of the Soviet Union until 1990 when the Congress of People's Deputies modified Article 6 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which had previously granted the CPSU a monopoly over the political system.","image":"КПСС.svg.png.webp"}
