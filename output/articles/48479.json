{"title":"Wild Bill Hickok","summary":"James Butler Hickok (May 27, 1837 – August 2, 1876), better known as \"Wild Bill\" Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West known for his life on the frontier as a soldier, scout, lawman, gambler, showman, and actor, and for his involvement in many famous gunfights. He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated tales he told about himself. Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation.","image":"Wild_Bill_Hickok_sepia.png.webp","url":"Wild_Bill_Hickok"}
