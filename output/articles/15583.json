{"title":"Eye for an eye","summary":"\"An eye for an eye\" (Biblical Hebrew: עַיִן תַּחַת עַיִן‎, Ain takhat ain)[lower-alpha 1] is a commandment found in Exodus 21:23–27 expressing the principle of reciprocal justice measure for measure.  In Roman civilization, the law of retaliation (Latin: lex talionis)[1] bears the same principle that a person who has injured another person is to be penalized to a similar degree by the injured party.  In softer interpretations, it means the victim receives the [estimated] value of the injury in compensation.[2] The intent behind the principle was to restrict compensation to the value of the loss.[1]","image":"Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg.webp","url":"Eye_for_an_eye"}
