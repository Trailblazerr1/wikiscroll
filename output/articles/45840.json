{"title":"Treatment of slaves in the United States","summary":"The treatment of slaves in the United States varied by time and place, but was generally brutal, especially on plantations. Whipping and rape were routine, but usually not in front of white outsiders, or even the plantation owner's family. (\"When I whip niggers, I take them out of the sight and hearing of the house, and no one in my family knows it.\"[1]: 36 ) An enslaved person could not be a witness against a white; enslaved people were sometimes required to whip other enslaved people, even family members.[2]: 54  There were also businesses to which a slave owner could turn over the whipping.[2]: 24 [3]: 53  Families were often split up by the sale of one or more members, usually never to see or hear of each other again.[4] There were some relatively enlightened slave owners—Nat Turner said his master was kind[5]—but not on large plantations. Only a small minority of enslaved people received anything resembling decent treatment; one contemporary estimate was 10%, not without noting that the ones well treated desired freedom just as much as those poorly treated.[3]: 16, 31  Good treatment could vanish upon the death of an owner. As put by William T. Allan, a slaveowner's abolitionist son who could not safely return to Alabama, \"cruelty was the rule, and kindness the exception\".[6][7]","image":"Scourged_back_by_McPherson_%26_Oliver%2C_1863%2C_retouched.jpg.webp"}
