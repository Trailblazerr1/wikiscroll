{"title":"Quantum computing","summary":"Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. The devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers.[1]: I-5  Though current quantum computers are too small to outperform usual (classical) computers for practical applications, they are believed to be capable of solving certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers.[2] The study of quantum computing is a subfield of quantum information science.","image":"IBM_Q_system_(Fraunhofer_2).jpg.webp","url":"Quantum_computing"}
