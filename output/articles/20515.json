{"title":"History of feminism","summary":"The history of feminism comprises the narratives (chronological or thematic) of the movements and ideologies which have aimed at equal rights for women. While feminists around the world have differed in causes, goals, and intentions depending on time, culture, and country, most Western feminist historians assert that all movements that work to obtain women's rights should be considered feminist movements, even when they did not (or do not) apply the term to themselves.[1][2][3][4][5] Some other historians limit the term \"feminist\" to the modern feminist movement and its progeny, and use the label \"protofeminist\" to describe earlier movements.[6]","image":"Symbol_venus.svg.png.webp","url":"History_of_feminism"}
