{"title":"Hypochlorous acid","summary":"Hypochlorous acid (HOCl or HClO) is a weak acid that forms when chlorine dissolves in water, and itself partially dissociates, forming hypochlorite, ClO−. HClO and ClO− are oxidizers, and the primary disinfection agents of chlorine solutions.[2] HClO cannot be isolated from these solutions due to rapid equilibration with its precursor. Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and calcium hypochlorite  (Ca(ClO)2), are bleaches, deodorants, and disinfectants.","image":"Hypochlorous-acid-2D-dimensions.svg.png.webp","url":"Hypochlorous_acid"}
