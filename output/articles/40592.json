{"title":"Siege of Boston","summary":"The siege of Boston (April 19, 1775 â€“ March 17, 1776) was the opening phase of the American Revolutionary War.[5] New England militiamen prevented the movement by land of the British Army, which was garrisoned in what was then the peninsular city of Boston, Massachusetts Bay. Both sides had to deal with resource, supply, and personnel issues over the course of the siege. British resupply and reinforcement was limited to sea access, which was impeded by American vessels. The British abandoned Boston after eleven months and transferred their troops and equipment to Nova Scotia.","image":"SiegeBoston.jpg.webp","url":"Siege_of_Boston"}
