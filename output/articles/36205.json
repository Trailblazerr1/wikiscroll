{"title":"Programmed cell death protein 1","summary":"Programmed cell death protein 1, also known as PD-1 and  CD279 (cluster of differentiation 279), is a protein on the surface of T and B cells that has a role in regulating the immune system's response to the cells of the human body by down-regulating the immune system and promoting self-tolerance by suppressing T cell inflammatory activity. This prevents autoimmune diseases, but it can also prevent the immune system from killing cancer cells.[5]","image":"PD-1_ribbon_3RRQ.png.webp","url":"Programmed_cell_death_protein_1"}
