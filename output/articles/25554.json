{"title":"Laser Interferometer Space Antenna","summary":"The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a proposed space probe to detect and accurately measure gravitational waves[2]—tiny ripples in the fabric of spacetime—from astronomical sources.[3] LISA would be the first dedicated space-based gravitational wave detector. It aims to measure gravitational waves directly by using laser interferometry. The LISA concept has a constellation of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with sides 2.5 million kilometres long, flying along an Earth-like heliocentric orbit. The distance between the satellites is precisely monitored to detect a passing gravitational wave.[2]","image":"LISA-waves.jpg.webp","url":"Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna"}
