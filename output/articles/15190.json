{"title":"Estrous cycle","summary":"The estrous cycle (from Latin  oestrus 'frenzy', originally from Ancient Greek  οἶστρος (oîstros) 'gadfly') is the set of recurring physiological changes that are induced by reproductive hormones in most mammalian therian females.[1] Estrous cycles start after sexual maturity in females and are interrupted by anestrous phases, otherwise known as \"rest\" phases, or by pregnancies. Typically, estrous cycles repeat until death. These cycles are widely variable in duration and frequency depending on the species.[2] Some animals may display bloody vaginal discharge, often mistaken for menstruation.[3] Many mammals used in commercial agriculture, such as cattle and sheep, may have their estrous cycles artificially controlled with hormonal medications for optimum productivity.[4][5] Naturally, estrous cycles are complemented by a rutting period of male counterparts within a species.[2]","image":"Estrous_cycle.png.webp","url":"Estrous_cycle"}
