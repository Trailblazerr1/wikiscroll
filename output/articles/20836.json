The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1910-1911) defines a hostage as \"a person who is handed over by one of two belligerent parties to the other or seized as security for the carrying out of an agreement, or as a preventive measure against certain acts of war.\"[1] Hostage taking is now considered a criminal activity.","image":"Hostage_exercise.jpeg.webp","url":"Hostage"}
