{"title":"Dactyloidae","summary":"Dactyloidae are a family of lizards commonly known as anoles (US: /əˈnoʊ.liz/ (listen)) and native to warmer parts of the Americas, ranging from southeastern United States to Paraguay.[1][2] Instead of treating it as a family, some authorities prefer to treat it as a subfamily, Dactyloidae, of the family Iguanidae.[3][4] In the past they were included in the family Polychrotidae together with Polychrus (bush anoles), but the latter genus is not closely related to the true anoles.[5][6]","image":"Green_anole.jpg.webp","url":"Dactyloidae"}
