{"title":"Convex polytope","summary":"A convex polytope is a special case of a polytope, having the additional property that it is also a convex set contained in the \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  \n-dimensional Euclidean space \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            n\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{n}}\n  \n. Most texts[1][2] use the term \"polytope\" for a bounded convex polytope, and the word \"polyhedron\" for the more general, possibly unbounded object. Others[3] (including this article) allow polytopes to be unbounded. The terms \"bounded/unbounded convex polytope\" will be used below whenever the boundedness is critical to the discussed issue. Yet other texts identify a convex polytope with its boundary.","image":"a601995d55609f2d9f5e233e36fbe9ea26011b3b.svg"}
