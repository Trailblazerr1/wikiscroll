{"title":"List of Olympic medalists in speed skating","summary":"Speed skating is a sport that has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the inaugural Games in 1924.[1] Events held at the first Winter Olympics included the men's 500-metre, 1500-metre, 5000-metre, and 10,000-metre races. Points from the four races were combined and counted towards the all-round event, which was dropped following the 1924 Olympics. Speed skating events for women were first held at the 1932 Winter Olympics, as part of the demonstration program. The organizing committee of those Games advocated for the full inclusion of the womenâ€™s events, but the IOC rejected that.[2][3] The first official women's events were held in Squaw Valley 1960 with the 500-metre, 1000-metre, 1500-metre, and 3000-metre distances. The men's 1000-metre event was added in 1976 and the women's 5000-metre event was added in 1988. All 10 events have been held at every Olympic Games since, and a team pursuit event for both genders was added in 2006, for a total of 12 medal events.[4]","image":"Anesi_Fabris_Sanfratello_2006.jpg.webp"}
