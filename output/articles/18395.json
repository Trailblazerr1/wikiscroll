{"title":"Golden hamster","summary":"The golden hamster or Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) is a rodent belonging to the hamster subfamily, Cricetinae.[2] Their natural geographical range is limited to a small arid region of northern Syria and southern Turkey. Their numbers have been declining in the wild due to a loss of habitat from agriculture and deliberate elimination by humans.[1] Thus, wild golden hamsters are now considered Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[3]","image":"Golden_hamster_front_1.jpg.webp","url":"Golden_hamster"}
