{"title":"Hessian (soldier)","summary":"Hessians (US: /ˈhɛʃənz/ or UK: /ˈhɛsiənz/)[1] were German soldiers who served as auxiliaries to the British Army during the American Revolutionary War.[2] The term is an American synecdoche for all Germans who fought on the British side, since 65% came from the German states of Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Hanau. Known for their discipline and martial prowess, around 30,000 Germans fought for the British during war, comprising a quarter of British land forces.[3]","image":"Hessian_jager.jpg.webp","url":"Hessian_(soldier)"}
