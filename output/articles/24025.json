{"title":"Joule–Thomson effect","summary":"In thermodynamics, the Joule–Thomson effect (also known as the Joule–Kelvin effect or Kelvin–Joule effect) describes the temperature change of a real gas or liquid (as differentiated from an ideal gas) when it is forced through a valve or porous plug while keeping it insulated so that no heat is exchanged with the environment.[1][2][3] This procedure is called a throttling process or Joule–Thomson process.[4] At room temperature, all gases except hydrogen, helium, and neon cool upon expansion by the Joule–Thomson process when being throttled through an orifice; these three gases experience the same effect but only at lower temperatures.[5][6] Most liquids such as hydraulic oils will be warmed by the Joule–Thomson throttling process.","image":"Joule-Thomson_sign.png.webp"}
