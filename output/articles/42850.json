{"title":"Supernatural (Santana album)","summary":"Supernatural is the eighteenth studio album by Latin rock band Santana, released on June 15, 1999, on Arista Records.

Davis had originally signed the group to Columbia Records in 1969 when he was president of that label. Santana and Davis collaborated with A&R man Pete Ganbarg, as Santana wanted to focus on pop and radio-friendly material; Santana collaborated with contemporary guest artists including Eric Clapton, Rob Thomas, Eagle-Eye Cherry, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Man√°, KC Porter and CeeLo Green.","image":"Santana_-_Supernatural_-_CD_album_cover.jpg.webp"}
