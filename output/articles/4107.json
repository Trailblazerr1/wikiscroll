{"title":"Apomorphine","summary":"Apomorphine, sold under the brand name Apokyn among others, is a type of aporphine having activity as a non-selective dopamine agonist which activates both D2-like and, to a much lesser extent, D1-like receptors.[1] It also acts as an antagonist of 5-HT2 and Î±-adrenergic receptors with high affinity. The compound is historically a morphine decomposition product made by boiling morphine with concentrated acid, hence the -morphine suffix. Contrary to its name, apomorphine does not actually contain morphine or its skeleton, nor does it bind to opioid receptors. The apo- prefix relates to it being a morphine derivative (\"[comes] from morphine\").","image":"Apomorphine2DCSD.svg.png.webp","url":"Apomorphine"}
