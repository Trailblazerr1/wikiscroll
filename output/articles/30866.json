{"title":"Murder of Jun Lin","summary":"The murder of Jun Lin is a murder case involving dismemberment and cannibalism that occurred in Montreal, Canada. In May 2012, Jun Lin (December 30, 1978 – May 24/25, 2012), a university student, was fatally stabbed and dismembered by Luka Rocco Magnotta, who then mailed Lin's hands and feet to elementary schools and federal political party offices.[1] After a video depicting the murder was posted online, Magnotta fled Canada, becoming the subject of an Interpol Red Notice and prompting an international manhunt. In June 2012, he was arrested in an internet café in Berlin.[1] In December 2014, after eight days of deliberations, a jury convicted him of first-degree murder.[2] Magnotta was previously sought by animal rights groups for allegedly uploading videos of himself killing kittens.[3]","image":"Luka_Rocco_Magnotta_mugshot.jpg.webp"}
