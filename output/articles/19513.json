{"title":"Hampstead Heath","summary":"Hampstead Heath (locally known simply as the Heath) is a large, ancient London heath, covering 320 hectares (790 acres).[1] This grassy public space sits astride a sandy ridge, one of the highest points in London, running from Hampstead to Highgate, which rests on a band of London Clay.[2] The heath is rambling and hilly, embracing ponds, recent and ancient woodlands, a lido, playgrounds, and a training track, and it adjoins the former stately home of Kenwood House and its estate. The south-east part of the heath is Parliament Hill, from which the view over London is protected by law.","image":"Hampstead_Heath_entrance_south.JPG.webp"}
