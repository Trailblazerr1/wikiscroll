{"title":"Metric (mathematics)","summary":"In mathematics, a metric or distance function is a function that gives a distance  between each pair of point elements of a set. A set with a metric is called a metric space.[1] A metric induces a topology on a set, but not all topologies can be generated by a metric. A topological space whose topology can be described by a metric is called metrizable.","image":"Manhattan_distance.svg.png.webp","url":"Metric_(mathematics)"}
