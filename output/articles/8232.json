{"title":"Cali Cartel","summary":"The Cali Cartel (Spanish: Cartel de Cali) was a drug cartel based in southern Colombia, around the city of Cali and the Valle del Cauca Department. Its founders were the brothers Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela, and José Santacruz Londoño. They broke away from Pablo Escobar and his Medellín associates in the late 1980s, when Hélmer \"Pacho\" Herrera joined what became a four-man executive board that ran the cartel.[2]","image":"Carteldecaliposter-2.png.webp","url":"Cali_Cartel"}
