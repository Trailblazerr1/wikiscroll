{"title":"Typographical error","summary":"A typographical error (often shortened/nicknamed to typo), also called misprint, is a mistake (such as a spelling mistake)[1] made in the typing of printed (or electronic) material. Historically, this referred to mistakes in manual type-setting (typography). Technically, the term includes errors due to mechanical failure or slips of the hand or finger,[2] but excludes errors of ignorance, such as spelling errors, or changing and misuse of words such as \"than\" and \"then\". Before the arrival of printing, the \"copyist's mistake\" or \"scribal error\" was the equivalent for manuscripts. Most typos involve simple duplication, omission, transposition, or substitution of a small number of characters.","image":"Spelling_Correction_Example.jpg.webp","url":"Typographical_error"}
