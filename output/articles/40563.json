{"title":"Siberian tiger","summary":"The Siberian tiger is a tiger from a specific population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies native to the Russian Far East, Northeast China,[3] and possibly North Korea.[4] It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula, north China, and eastern Mongolia. The population currently inhabits mainly the Sikhote-Alin mountain region in southwest Primorye Province in the Russian Far East. In 2005, there were 331–393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The population had been stable for more than a decade because of intensive conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that the Russian tiger population was declining.[1] An initial census held in 2015 indicated that the Siberian tiger population had increased to 480–540 individuals in the Russian Far East, including 100 cubs.[5][6] This was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a total population of 562 wild Siberian tigers in Russia.[7] As of 2014, about 35 individuals were estimated to range in the international border area between Russia and China.[8]","image":"P.t.altaica_Tomak_Male.jpg.webp","url":"Siberian_tiger"}
