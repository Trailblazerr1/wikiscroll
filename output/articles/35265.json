{"title":"Plumbing","summary":"Plumbing is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range of applications. Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids.[1]  Heating and cooling (HVAC), waste removal, and potable water delivery are among the most common uses for plumbing, but it is not limited to these applications.[2]  The word derives from the Latin for lead, plumbum, as the first effective pipes used in the Roman era were lead pipes.[3]","image":"Pipes_various.jpg.webp"}
