{"title":"Australian Cattle Dog","summary":"The Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog.","image":"ACD-blue-spud.jpg.webp","url":"Australian_Cattle_Dog"}
