{"title":"Body of water","summary":"A body of water or waterbody[1] (often spelled water body) is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface. The term most often refers to oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.[2]","image":"Aubach_(Wiehl)_nahe_dem_Weiherdamm_in_Wildbergerh√ºtte.jpg.webp"}
