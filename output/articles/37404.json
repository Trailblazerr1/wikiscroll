{"title":"Red River of the South","summary":"The Red River, or sometimes the Red River of the South, is a major river in the Southern United States.[2] It was named for its reddish water color from passing through red-bed country in its watershed.[3] It is one of several rivers with that name. Although once a tributary of the Mississippi River, the Red River is now a tributary of the Atchafalaya River, a distributary of the Mississippi that flows separately into the Gulf of Mexico. This confluence is connected to the Mississippi River by the Old River Control Structure.","image":"Redriverbonhamtx.jpg.webp"}
