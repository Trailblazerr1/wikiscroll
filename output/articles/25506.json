{"title":"Lapland (Finland)","summary":"Lapland (Finnish: Lappi [ˈlɑpːi]; Northern Sami: Sápmi [ˈsaːpmiː]; Swedish: Lappland; Latin: Lapponia) is the largest and northernmost region of Finland. The 21 municipalities in the region cooperate in a Regional Council. Lapland borders the region of North Ostrobothnia in the south. It also borders the Gulf of Bothnia, Norrbotten County in Sweden, Troms and Finnmark County in Norway, and Murmansk Oblast and the Republic of Karelia in Russia. Topography varies from vast mires and forests of the South to fells in the North. The Arctic circle crosses Lapland, so polar phenomena such as the midnight sun and polar night can be seen in Lapland.[1][2]","image":"Pallastunturi.jpg.webp"}
