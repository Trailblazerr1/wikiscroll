{"title":"Bering Sea","summary":"The Bering Sea (/ˈbɛərɪŋ, ˈbɛrɪŋ/, US also /ˈbɪərɪŋ/;[1][2][3] Russian: Бе́рингово мо́ре, tr. Béringovo móre) is a marginal sea of the Northern Pacific Ocean. It forms, along with the Bering Strait, the divide between the two largest landmasses on Earth: Eurasia and The Americas.[4][5] It comprises a deep water basin, which then rises through a narrow slope into the shallower water above the continental shelves.  The Bering Sea is named for Vitus Bering, a Danish navigator in Russian service, who, in 1728, was the first European to systematically explore it, sailing from the Pacific Ocean northward to the Arctic Ocean.[6]","image":"LA2-Bering-Sea-UTM-zones.png.webp"}
