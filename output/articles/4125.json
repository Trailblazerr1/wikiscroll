{"title":"Apparent magnitude","summary":"Apparent magnitude (m) is a measure of the brightness of a star or other astronomical object observed from Earth. An object's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic luminosity, its distance from Earth, and any extinction of the object's light caused by interstellar dust along the line of sight to the observer.","image":"65Cyb-LB3-apmag.jpg.webp","url":"Apparent_magnitude"}
