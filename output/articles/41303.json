{"title":"Solvation","summary":"Solvation (or dissolution) describes the interaction of solvent with dissolved molecules. Both ionized and uncharged molecules interact strongly with solvent, and the strength and nature of this interaction influence many properties of the solute, including solubility, reactivity, and color, as well as influencing the properties of the solvent such as the viscosity and density.[1] In the process of solvation, ions are surrounded by a concentric shell of solvent.  Solvation is the process of reorganizing solvent and solute molecules into solvation complexes.  Solvation involves bond formation, hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces.  Solvation of a solute by water is called hydration.[2]","image":"Na%2BH2O.svg.png.webp","url":"Solvation"}
