{"title":"STS-134","summary":"STS-134 (ISS assembly flight ULF6)[9] was the penultimate mission of NASA's Space Shuttle program and the 25th and last spaceflight of Space Shuttle Endeavour.[10] This flight delivered the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier to the International Space Station.[11] Mark Kelly served as the mission commander. STS-134 was expected to be the final space shuttle mission if STS-135 did not receive funding from Congress. However, in February 2011, NASA stated that STS-135 would fly \"regardless\" of the funding situation.[12][13] STS-135, flown by Atlantis, took advantage of the processing for STS-335, the Launch on Need mission that would have been necessary if the STS-134 crew became stranded in orbit.","image":"Endeavour_docked_to_ISS.jpg.webp","url":"STS-134"}
