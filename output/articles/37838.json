{"title":"Ribose","summary":"Ribose is a simple sugar and carbohydrate with molecular formula C5H10O5 and the linear-form composition H−(C=O)−(CHOH)4−H.  The naturally-occurring form,  d-ribose, is a component of the ribonucleotides from which RNA is built, and so this compound is necessary for coding, decoding, regulation and expression of genes.  It has a structural analog, deoxyribose, which is a similarly essential component of DNA.   l-ribose is an unnatural sugar that was first prepared by Emil Fischer and Oscar Piloty in 1891.[3] It was not until 1909 that Phoebus Levene and Walter Jacobs recognised that  d-ribose was a natural product, the enantiomer of Fischer and Piloty's product, and an essential component of nucleic acids.[4][5][6] Fischer chose the name \"ribose\" as it is a partial rearrangement of the name of another sugar, arabinose, of which ribose is an epimer at the 2' carbon; both names also relate to gum arabic, from which arabinose was first isolated and from which they prepared  l-ribose.[6][7]","image":"D-Ribose.png.webp"}
