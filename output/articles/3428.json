{"title":"Amylin","summary":"Amylin, or islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), is a 37-residue peptide hormone.[4]  It is co-secreted with insulin from the pancreatic Î²-cells in the ratio of approximately 100:1 (insulin:amylin).  Amylin plays a role in glycemic regulation by slowing gastric emptying and promoting satiety, thereby preventing post-prandial spikes in blood glucose levels.","image":"Ideogram_human_chromosome_12.svg.png.webp","url":"Amylin"}
