{"title":"Silk Road (marketplace)","summary":"Silk Road was an online black market and the first modern darknet market.[7] As part of the dark web,[8] it was operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website was launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior.[9][10] Initially there were a limited number of new seller accounts available; new sellers had to purchase an account in an auction. Later, a fixed fee was charged for each new seller account.[11][12] Silk Road provided goods and services to over 100,000 buyers.[13]","image":"Silk_road_logo.svg.png.webp"}
