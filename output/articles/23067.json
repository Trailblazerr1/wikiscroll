{"title":"Japanese macaque","summary":"The Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata), also known as the snow monkey, is a terrestrial Old World monkey species that is native to Japan. They are colloquially referred to as \"snow monkeys\" because some live in areas where snow covers the ground for months each year â€“ no other non-human primate is more northern-living, nor lives in a colder climate.[3] Individuals have brownish grey fur, pinkish-red faces, and short tails. Two subspecies are known.[4]","image":"Japanese_Snow_Monkey_(Macaque)_Mother_Grooms_Her_Young.jpg.webp"}
