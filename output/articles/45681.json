{"title":"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus","summary":"The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (widely abbreviated and cited as TLP) is the only book-length philosophical work by the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein that was published during his lifetime. It is recognized by philosophers as a significant philosophical work of the twentieth century. The project had a broad goal: to identify the relationship between language and reality and to define the limits of science.[1] The work was originally published in German in 1921 as Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung (Logical-Philosophical Treatise). In 1922 it was published together with an English translation;  the English text and that book bear the Latin title, which was suggested by G. E. Moore as homage to Baruch Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1670).[2]","image":"Tractatus_title_page_1922_Harcourt.png.webp","url":"Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus"}
