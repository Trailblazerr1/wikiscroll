{"title":"Wu Chinese","summary":"The Wu languages (traditional Chinese: 吳語; simplified Chinese: 吴语; Wu romanization and IPA: ngu1 ngiu2 [ŋŋ̍.ȵy], Mandarin pinyin and IPA: Wúyǔ [u³⁵ y²¹⁴]) is a major group of Sinitic languages spoken primarily in Shanghai, Zhejiang Province and the part of Jiangsu Province south of the Yangtze River, which makes up the cultural region of Wu. The Suzhou dialect was the prestige dialect of Wu as of the 19th century and it formed the basis of Wu's koiné dialect, Shanghainese, at the turn of the 20th century. Speakers of various Wu languages sometimes inaccurately labelled their mother tongue as \"Shanghainese\" when introduced to foreigners. The languages of Northern Wu are mutually intelligible with each other, while those of Southern Wu are not.","image":"Idioma_wu.png.webp"}
