{"title":"State-space representation","summary":"In control engineering, a state-space representation is a mathematical model of a physical system as a set of input, output and state variables related by first-order differential equations or difference equations. State variables are variables whose values evolve over time in a way that depends on the values they have at any given time and on the externally imposed values of input variables. Output variablesâ€™ values depend on the values of the state variables.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"State-space_representation"}
