{"title":"Secretion","summary":"Secretion is the movement of material from one point to another, such as a secreted chemical substance from a cell or gland. In contrast, excretion, is the removal of certain substances or waste products from a cell or organism. The classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called porosomes.[1] Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.","image":"Porosome_for_wiki-2.jpg.webp"}
