{"title":"Disney's Nine Old Men","summary":"Disney's Nine Old Men were Walt Disney Productions' core animators,[1] some of whom later became directors, who created some of Disney's most famous animated cartoons, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) onward to The Rescuers (1977), and were referred to as such by Walt Disney himself.[Note 1]  They worked in both short films and feature films. Disney delegated more and more tasks to them in the animation department in the early 1950s when their interests expanded and diversified their scope. Eric Larson was the last to retire from Disney, after his role as animation consultant on The Great Mouse Detective in 1986.[2][3] All members of the group are now deceased, and are acknowledged as Disney Legends.","image":"Disney's_nine_old_men.png.webp"}
