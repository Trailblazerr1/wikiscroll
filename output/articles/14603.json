{"title":"Elliott wave principle","summary":"The Elliott wave principle is a form of technical analysis that finance traders may use to analyze financial market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective factors. Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871â€“1948), a professional accountant, believed he discovered underlying social principles and developed the analytical tools in the 1930s. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which practitioners today call Elliott waves, or simply waves. Elliott published his theory of market behavior in the book The Wave Principle in 1938, summarized it in a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939, and covered it most comprehensively in his final major work, Nature's Laws: The Secret of the Universe in 1946. Elliott stated that \"because man is subject to rhythmical procedure, calculations having to do with his activities can be projected far into the future with a justification and certainty heretofore unattainable.\"[1] The empirical validity of the Elliott wave principle remains the subject of debate.","image":"Elliott_wave.svg.png.webp"}
