{"title":"Legal person","summary":"In law, a legal person is any person or 'thing' (less ambiguously, any legal entity)[1][2] that can do the things a human person is usually able to do in law â€“ such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on.[3][4][5] The reason for the term \"legal person\" is that some legal persons are not people: companies and corporations are \"persons\" legally speaking (they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do), but they are clearly not people in the ordinary sense.","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp"}
