{"title":"Blogger (service)","summary":"Blogger is an American online content management system which enables multi-user blogs with time-stamped entries. Pyra Labs developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003. Google hosts the blogs, which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Blogs can also be accessed from a user-owned custom domain (such as www.example.com) by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google's servers.[3][4][5] A user can have up to 100 blogs or websites per account.[6]","image":"Blogger_icon_2017.svg.png.webp","url":"Blogger_(service)"}
