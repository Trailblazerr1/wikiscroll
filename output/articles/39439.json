{"title":"Sarin","summary":"Sarin (NATO designation GB [short for G-series, \"B\"]) is an extremely toxic synthetic organophosphorus compound.[4] A colourless, odourless liquid, it is used as a chemical weapon due to its extreme potency as a nerve agent. Exposure is lethal even at very low concentrations, where death can occur within one to ten minutes after direct inhalation of a lethal dose,[5][6] due to suffocation from respiratory paralysis, unless antidotes are quickly administered.[4] People who absorb a non-lethal dose, but do not receive immediate medical treatment, may suffer permanent neurological damage.","image":"Sarin-2D-by-AHRLS-2011.png.webp","url":"Sarin"}
