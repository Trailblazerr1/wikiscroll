{"title":"Hodgkin–Huxley model","summary":"The Hodgkin–Huxley model, or conductance-based model, is a mathematical model that describes how action potentials in neurons are initiated and propagated. It is a set of nonlinear differential equations that approximates the electrical characteristics of excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac myocytes. It is a continuous-time dynamical system.","image":"Hodgkin-Huxley.svg.png.webp","url":"Hodgkin–Huxley_model"}
