{"title":"Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy","summary":"Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)[1] is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects high-resolution spectral data over a wide spectral range. This confers a significant advantage over a dispersive spectrometer, which measures intensity over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time.","image":"FTIR_Spectrometer_%2B_ATR.jpg.webp","url":"Fourier-transform_infrared_spectroscopy"}
