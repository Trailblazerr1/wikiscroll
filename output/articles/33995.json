{"title":"Part of speech","summary":"In traditional grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech   (abbreviated as POS or PoS) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntaxic behavior—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes similar morphology in that they undergo inflection for similar properties.","image":"EnglishGrammarCategories.png.webp","url":"Part_of_speech"}
