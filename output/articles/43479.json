{"title":"Tax evasion","summary":"Tax evasion is an illegal attempt to defeat the imposition of taxes by individuals, corporations, trusts, and others. Tax evasion often entails the deliberate misrepresentation of the taxpayer's affairs to the tax authorities to reduce the taxpayer's tax liability, and it includes dishonest tax reporting, such as declaring less income, profits or gains than the amounts actually earned, or overstating deductions.","image":"10_Percent_Legacy_and_Succession_Duty_Impressed_Duty_Stamp.svg.png.webp","url":"Tax_evasion"}
