{"title":"Markup language","summary":"In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is visually distinguishable from the content.[1] It is used only to format the text, so that when the document is processed for display, the markup language does not appear.[2] The idea and terminology evolved from the \"marking up\" of paper manuscripts (i.e., the revision instructions by editors), which is traditionally written with a red pen or blue pencil on authors' manuscripts.[3] Such \"markup\" typically includes both content corrections (such as spelling, punctuation, or movement of content), and also typographic instructions, such as to make a heading larger or boldface.","image":"RecipeBook_XML_Example.png.webp"}
