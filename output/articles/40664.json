{"title":"Silencer (firearms)","summary":"A silencer, also known as a sound suppressor, suppressor or sound moderator, is a muzzle device that reduces the acoustic intensity of the muzzle report (sound of a gunshot) and the recoil when a gun (firearm or air gun) is discharged, by modulating the speed and pressure of the propellant gas from the muzzle and hence suppressing the muzzle blast.  Like other muzzle devices, a silencer can be a detachable accessory mounted to the muzzle, or an integral part of the barrel.","image":"GSL_Suppressors_.jpg.webp","url":"Silencer_(firearms)"}
