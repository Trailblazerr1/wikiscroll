{"title":"Solar eclipse of August 12, 2045","summary":"A total solar eclipse will occur on Saturday, August 12, 2045, when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.","image":"SE2045Aug12T.png.webp","url":"Solar_eclipse_of_August_12,_2045"}
