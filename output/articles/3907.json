{"title":"Anthropocentrism","summary":"Anthropocentrism (/ˌænθroʊpoʊˈsɛntrɪzəm/;[1] from Ancient Greek: ἄνθρωπος, ánthrōpos, \"human being\"; and Ancient Greek: κέντρον, kéntron, \"center\") is the belief that human beings are the central or most important entity in the universe.[2]  The term can be used interchangeably with humanocentrism, and some refer to the concept as human supremacy or human exceptionalism. From an anthropocentric perspective, humankind is seen as separate from nature and superior to it, and other entities (animals, plants, minerals, etc) are viewed as resources for humans to use.[2]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
