{"title":"Paleo-Hebrew alphabet","summary":"The Paleo-Hebrew script (Hebrew: הכתב העברי הקדום‎), also Palaeo-Hebrew, Proto-Hebrew or Old Hebrew, is the writing system found in Canaanite inscriptions from the region of Biblical Israel and Judah. It is considered to be the script used to record the original texts of the Hebrew Bible due to its similarity to the Samaritan script, as the Talmud stated that the Hebrew ancient script was still used by the Samaritans.[1] The Talmud described it as the \"Libona'a script\" (Hebrew: ליבונאה‎), translated by some as \"Lebanon script\".[2] Use of the term \"Paleo-Hebrew alphabet\" is due to a 1954 suggestion by Solomon Birnbaum, who argued that \"[t]o apply the term Phoenician to the script of the Hebrews is hardly suitable\".[3]","image":"Paleo-Hebrew_abjad.svg.png.webp"}
