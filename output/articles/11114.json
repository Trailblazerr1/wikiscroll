{"title":"Cooking banana","summary":"Cooking bananas[1] are banana cultivars in the genus Musa whose fruits are generally used in cooking. They may be eaten ripe or unripe and are generally starchy.[2] Many cooking bananas are referred to as plantains (/ˈplæntɪn/[3] US: /plænˈteɪn/,[3]UK: /ˈplɑːntɪn/[3]) or green bananas.[4] In botanical usage, the term \"plantain\" is used only for true plantains, while other starchy cultivars used for cooking are called \"cooking bananas\".[4] True plantains are cultivars belonging to the AAB Group, while cooking bananas are any cultivars belonging to AAB, AAA, ABB, or BBB groups.[4] The currently accepted scientific name for all such cultivars in these groups is Musa × paradisiaca.[4] Fe'i bananas (Musa × troglodytarum) from the Pacific Islands are often eaten roasted or boiled, and are thus informally referred to as \"mountain plantains,\" but they do not belong to any of the species from which all modern banana cultivars are descended.[5]","image":"Mega_racimos_de_guineos.jpg.webp"}
