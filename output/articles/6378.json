{"title":"Bethlehem","summary":"Bethlehem (/ˈbɛθlɪhɛm/; Arabic: بيت لحم‎ Bayt Laḥm, \"House of Meat\"; Hebrew: בֵּית לֶחֶם‎ Bet Leḥem, Hebrew pronunciation: [bet ˈleχem], \"House of Bread\"; Ancient Greek: Βηθλεέμ Greek pronunciation: [bɛːtʰle.ém]; Latin: Bethleem; initially named after Canaanite fertility god Laḫmu[3]) is a city in the central West Bank, Palestine, about 10 km (6.2 miles) south of Jerusalem. Its population is approximately 25,000,[4][5] and it is the capital of the Bethlehem Governorate. The economy is primarily tourist-driven, peaking during the Christmas season, when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity.[6][7] The important holy site of Rachel's Tomb is at the northern entrance of Bethlehem, though not freely accessible to the city's own inhabitants and in general Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank due to the Israeli West Bank barrier.","image":"Bethlehem_skyline%2C_West_Bank.jpg.webp","url":"Bethlehem"}
