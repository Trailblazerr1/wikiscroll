{"title":"Spandau Prison","summary":"Spandau Prison was located in the borough of Spandau in western Berlin. It was originally a military prison, but became a proto-concentration camp under the Nazis. After the war, it held seven top Nazi leaders convicted in the Nuremberg trials. It was constructed in 1876 and demolished in August 1987 to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine after the death of its last prisoner, Rudolf Hess, who had died from a suspected suicide aged 93. The site was later rebuilt as a shopping centre for the British forces stationed in Germany.","image":"6th_Inf_Regt_Spandau_Prison_1951.jpg.webp"}
