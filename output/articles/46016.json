{"title":"Trolling (fishing)","summary":"Trolling is a method of fishing where one or more fishing lines, baited with lures or bait fish, are drawn through the water. This may be behind a moving boat, or by slowly winding the line in when fishing from a static position, or even sweeping the line from side-to-side, e.g. when fishing from a jetty. Trolling is used to catch pelagic fish such as salmon, mackerel and kingfish.","image":"Trolling_drawing.jpg.webp","url":"Trolling_(fishing)"}
