{"title":"1926 United Kingdom general strike","summary":"The 1926 general strike in the United Kingdom was a general strike that lasted nine days, from 4 to 12 May 1926.[1] It was called by the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) in an unsuccessful attempt to force the British government to act to prevent wage reductions and worsening conditions for 1.2 million locked-out coal miners. Some 1.7 million workers went out, especially in transport and heavy industry. The government was prepared, and enlisted middle class volunteers to maintain essential services. There was little violence and the TUC gave up in defeat.","image":"Tyldesley_miners_outside_the_Miners_Hall_during_the_1926_General_Strike.jpg.webp","url":"1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike"}
