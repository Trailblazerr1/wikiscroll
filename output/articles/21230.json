{"title":"Hydride","summary":"In chemistry, a hydride is formally the anion of hydrogen, Hâˆ’.[1] The term is applied loosely. At one extreme, all compounds containing covalently bound H atoms are called hydrides: water (H2O) is a hydride of oxygen, ammonia is a hydride of nitrogen, etc. For inorganic chemists, hydrides refer to compounds and ions in which hydrogen is covalently attached to a less electronegative element. In such cases, the H centre has nucleophilic character, which contrasts with the protic character of acids.  The hydride anion is very rarely observed.","image":"TTMSS.png.webp"}
