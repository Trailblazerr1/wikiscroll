{"title":"Cato the Elder","summary":"Marcus Porcius Cato (/ˈkeɪtoʊ/; 234–149 BC), also known as Cato the Censor (Latin: Censorius), the Elder and the Wise, was a Roman soldier, senator, and historian known for his conservatism and opposition to Hellenization.[1] He was the first to write history in Latin with his Origines, a now lost work on the History of Rome.  His work De agri cultura, a rambling work on agriculture, farming, rituals, and recipes, is the oldest extant prose written in the Latin language.  His epithet \"Elder\" distinguishes him from his equally famous great-grandson Cato the Younger, who opposed Julius Caesar.","image":"Patrizio_Torlonia.jpg.webp","url":"Cato_the_Elder"}
