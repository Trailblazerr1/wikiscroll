{"title":"SpaceX Starship","summary":"Starship is a class of fully reusable launch vehicles in development by American aerospace company SpaceX. The launch vehicle consists of a reusable stainless-steel  Super Heavy booster and a Starship spacecraft, designed to hold liquid oxygen with liquid methane used by Raptor rocket engines. Starship's large payload capacity to space and full reusability should make it both extremely cost-competitive and able to serve many facets of spaceflight, including space tourism, interplanetary spaceflight, and fast point-to-point flights between places on Earth. With these capabilities, the rocket is incorporated into many space missions, such as the dearMoon project, NASA's Artemis program, and SpaceX's Mars program.","image":"Starship_SN16.jpeg.webp"}
