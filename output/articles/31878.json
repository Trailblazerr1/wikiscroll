{"title":"New York Cosmos (1970–1985)","summary":"The New York Cosmos (simply the Cosmos in 1977–1978) were an American professional soccer club based in New York City and its suburbs. The team played home games in three stadiums around New York before moving in 1977 to Giants Stadium in nearby East Rutherford, New Jersey, where it remained for the rest of its history. Founded in December 1970, the team competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) until 1984 and was the strongest franchise in that league, both competitively and financially – based largely around its backing by Warner Communications President Steve Ross, which enabled it to sign internationally famous stars such as the Brazilian forward Pelé, Italian striker Giorgio Chinaglia and the West German sweeper Franz Beckenbauer. The acquisition of these foreign players, particularly Pelé, made the Cosmos into what journalist Gavin Newsham called \"the most glamorous team in world football\", and contributed to the development of soccer across the United States, a country where it had previously been largely ignored.","image":"New_York_Cosmos_77.png.webp","url":"New_York_Cosmos_(1970–1985)"}
