{"title":"Newfoundland (island)","summary":"Newfoundland (/ˈnjuːfən(d)lənd, nuː-, -lænd, njuːˈfaʊnd-/, locally /ˌnjuːfəndˈlænd/;[5] French: Terre-Neuve; Mi'kmaq: Taqamkuk)[6] is a large island off the east coast of the North American mainland and the most populous part of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It has 29 percent of the province's land area. The island is separated from the Labrador Peninsula by the Strait of Belle Isle and from Cape Breton Island by the Cabot Strait. It blocks the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, creating the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, the world's largest estuary. Newfoundland's nearest neighbour is the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.","image":"Newfoundland_OSE2002210.jpg.webp","url":"Newfoundland_(island)"}
