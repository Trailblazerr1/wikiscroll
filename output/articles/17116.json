{"title":"Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout","summary":"In automotive design, a FR, or front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout is one where the engine is located at the front of the vehicle and driven wheels are located at the rear via a drive shaft. This was the traditional automobile layout for most of the 20th century.[1] Modern designs commonly use the front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout (FF). It is also used in high-floor buses and school buses.","image":"Automotive_diagrams_01_En.png.webp","url":"Front-engine,_rear-wheel-drive_layout"}
