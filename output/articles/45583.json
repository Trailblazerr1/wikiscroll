{"title":"Totalitarianism","summary":"Totalitarianism is a form of government and a political system that prohibits all opposition parties, outlaws individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control and regulation over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of authoritarianism. In totalitarian states, political power is often held by autocrats, such as dictators and absolute monarchs, who employ all-encompassing campaigns in which propaganda is broadcast by state-controlled mass media in order to control the citizenry.[2] It remains a useful word but the old 1950s theory was considered to be outdated by the 1980s,[3] and is defunct among scholars.[4] The proposed concept gained prominent influence in Western anti-communist and McCarthyist political discourse during the Cold War era as a tool to convert pre-World War II anti-fascism into post-war anti-communism.[5][6][7][8][9]","image":"Historical_totalitarian_leaders.jpg.webp","url":"Totalitarianism"}
