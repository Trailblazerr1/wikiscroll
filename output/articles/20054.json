{"title":"Henry (bishop of Finland)","summary":"Henry (Finnish: Henrik; Swedish: Henrik; Latin: Henricus; died c. 20 January 1156[1]) was a medieval English clergyman. He came to Sweden with Cardinal Nicholas Breakspeare in 1153 and was most likely designated to be the new Archbishop of Uppsala, but the independent church province of Sweden could only be established in 1164 after the civil war, and Henry would have been sent to organize the Church in Finland, where Christians had already existed for two centuries.","image":"Bishop_henry_from_taivassalo_church2.jpg.webp","url":"Henry_(bishop_of_Finland)"}
