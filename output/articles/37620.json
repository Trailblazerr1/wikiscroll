{"title":"Repertory theatre","summary":"A repertory theatre (also called repertory, rep, true rep or stock) is a Western theatre in which a resident company presents works from a specified repertoire, usually in alternation or rotation.[1] [2] While the origins are debated, the repertory theatre movement became popular in the early twentieth century.[1] Not to be confused with a similar term, \"weekly rep,\" which denotes a British movement started in the early 1900s that focused on shorter runs of a single new work, rather than having several plays ready to perform at any given time.[3][2]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Repertory_theatre"}
