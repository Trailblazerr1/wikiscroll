{"title":"House of Saud","summary":"The House of Saud (Arabic: آل سُعُود‎, romanized: ʾĀl Suʿūd IPA: [ʔaːl sʊʕuːd]) is the ruling royal family of Saudi Arabia. It is composed of the descendants of Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the Emirate of Diriyah, known as the First Saudi state (1744–1818), and his brothers, though the ruling faction of the family is primarily led by the descendants of Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman, the modern founder of Saudi Arabia.[2] The most influential position of the royal family is the King of Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarch. The family in total is estimated to comprise some 15,000 members; however, the majority of power, influence and wealth is possessed by a group of about 2,000 of them.[3][4] Some estimates of the royal family's wealth measure their net worth at $1.4 trillion,[5] this figure includes the market capitalization of Saudi Aramco, the state oil and gas company, and its vast assets in fossil fuel reserves.","image":"Royal_Standard_of_Kingdom_of_Saudi_Arabia.svg.png.webp","url":"House_of_Saud"}
