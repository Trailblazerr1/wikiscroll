{"title":"Timeline of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season","summary":"The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record in terms of number of named storms. Additionally, it was as an above-average season for tropical cyclones for the fifth consecutive year.[nb 1][2] The season officially began on June 1, 2020, and ended on November 30, 2020. These dates, adopted by convention, historically delimit the period each year when most Atlantic tropical systems form.[3] However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as was the case this season, when its first two named storms, Tropical Storm Arthur and Tropical Storm Bertha, formed on May 16 and May 27, respectively. The final storm, Hurricane Iota, dissipated on November 18.","image":"2020_Atlantic_hurricane_season_summary_map.png.webp"}
