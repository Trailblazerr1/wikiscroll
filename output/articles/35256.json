{"title":"Plot (narrative)","summary":"In a literary work, film, or other narrative, the plot is the sequence of events where each affects the next one through the principle of cause-and-effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of events linked by the connector \"and so\". Plots can vary from the simple—such as in a traditional ballad—to forming complex interwoven structures, with each part sometimes referred to as a subplot or imbroglio.","image":"Story_v._plot.png.webp","url":"Plot_(narrative)"}
