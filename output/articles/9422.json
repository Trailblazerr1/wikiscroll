{"title":"Chatsworth House","summary":"Chatsworth House is a stately home in the Derbyshire Dales, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) north-east of Bakewell and 9 miles (14 km) west of Chesterfield, England. The seat of the Duke of Devonshire, it has belonged to the Cavendish family since 1549. It stands on the east bank of the River Derwent, across from hills between the Derwent and Wye valleys, amid parkland backed by wooded hills that rise to heather moorland. The house holds major collections of paintings, furniture, Old Master drawings, neoclassical sculptures and books. Chosen several times as Britain's favourite country house,[2][3] it is a Grade I listed property from the 18th century, altered in the 19th.[4][5] In 2011–2012 it underwent a £14-million restoration.[4] The owner is the Chatsworth House Trust, an independent charitable foundation, on behalf of the Cavendish family.[6]","image":"Chatsworth_Bridge.jpg.webp","url":"Chatsworth_House"}
