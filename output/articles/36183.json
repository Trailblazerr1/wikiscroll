{"title":"Production–possibility frontier","summary":"A production–possibility frontier (PPF), production possibility curve (PPC), or production possibility boundary (PPB), or transformation curve/boundary/frontier is a curve which shows various combinations of the amounts of two goods which can be produced within the given resources and technology/a graphical representation showing all the possible options of output for two products that can be produced using all factors of production, where the given resources are fully and efficiently utilized per unit time. A PPF illustrates several economic concepts, such as allocative efficiency, economies of scale, opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency,  and scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face).[1]","image":"Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg.png.webp","url":"Production–possibility_frontier"}
