{"title":"Taliban","summary":"The Taliban (/ˈtælɪbæn, ˈtɑːlɪbɑːn/; Pashto: طالبان‎, romanized: ṭālibān, lit. 'students' or 'seekers'),[75][76] which refers to itself as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan,[77] is a Deobandi-Pashtun Islamic fundamentalist, militant Islamist,[5] and jihadist[5] political movement and military organization in Afghanistan. Currently one of two entities claiming to be the legitimate government of Afghanistan, alongside the internationally recognized Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, the Taliban have de facto control of the country. The Taliban's ideology has been described as combining an \"innovative\" form of Sharia Islamic law which is based on Deobandi fundamentalism[78] and militant Islamism, combined[78] with Pashtun social and cultural norms which are known as Pashtunwali,[1][2][79][80] because most Taliban are Pashtun tribesmen. The group is internally funded by its involvement in the illegal drug trade which it participates in by producing and trafficking in narcotics such as heroin,[81][82] extortion, and kidnapping for ransom.[83][84] They also seized control of mining operations in the mid-2010s that were illegal under the previous government.[85]","image":"Flag_of_the_Taliban.svg.png.webp"}
