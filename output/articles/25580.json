{"title":"Late Roman army","summary":"In modern scholarship, the \"late\" period of the Roman army begins with the accession of the Emperor Diocletian in AD 284, and ends in 476 with the deposition of Romulus Augustulus, being roughly coterminous with the Dominate. During the period 395–476, the army of the Roman Empire's western half progressively disintegrated, while its counterpart in the East, known as the East Roman army (or the early Byzantine army) remained largely intact in size and structure until the reign of Justinian I (r. AD 527–565).[1]","image":"Labarum_of_Constantine_the_Great.svg.png.webp","url":"Late_Roman_army"}
