{"title":"Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915","summary":"The deportation of Armenian intellectuals is conventionally held to mark the beginning of the Armenian genocide.[1] Leaders of the Armenian community in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (now Istanbul), and later other locations, were arrested and moved to two holding centers near Angora (now Ankara). The order to do so was given by Minister of the Interior Talaat Pasha on 24 April 1915. On that night, the first wave of 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals of Constantinople were arrested. With the adoption of the Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915, these detainees were later relocated within the Ottoman Empire; most of them were ultimately killed. More than 80 such as Vrtanes Papazian, Aram Andonian, and Komitas survived.","image":"April24Victims.jpg.webp","url":"Deportation_of_Armenian_intellectuals_on_24_April_1915"}
