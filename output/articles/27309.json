{"title":"Long Walk of the Navajo","summary":"The Long Walk of the Navajo, also called the Long Walk to Bosque Redondo (Navajo: Hwéeldi), refers to the 1864 deportation and attempted ethnic cleansing[1][2] of the Navajo people by the United States federal government. Navajos were forced to walk from their land in what is now Arizona to eastern New Mexico. Some 53 different forced marches occurred between August 1864 and the end of 1866. Some anthropologists claim that the \"collective trauma of the Long Walk...is critical to contemporary Navajos' sense of identity as a people\".[3][4]","image":"Navajo_on_Long_Walk.gif","url":"Long_Walk_of_the_Navajo"}
