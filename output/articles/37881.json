Kuklinski was engaged in criminal activities for most of his adult life. He ran a burglary ring and distributed pirated pornography. Kuklinski killed several people he lured with offers of a business deal so that he could rob them of their cash.[2] Law enforcement officials described him as someone who killed for profit.[3] Kuklinski lived with his wife and children in the New Jersey suburb of Dumont. They knew him as a loving father and husband but one who also had a violent temper. They stated that they were unaware of his crimes. He was given the moniker Iceman by authorities after they discovered that he had frozen the body of one of his victims in an attempt to disguise the time of death.[1][4]","image":"Richardkuklinski2.JPG.webp"}
