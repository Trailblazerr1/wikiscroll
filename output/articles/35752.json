{"title":"Power of a test","summary":"The statistical power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{0}}\n  \n) when a specific alternative hypothesis (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          H\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle H_{1}}\n  \n) is true. It is commonly denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        −\n        β\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1-\\beta }\n  \n, and represents the chances of a \"true positive\" detection conditional on the actual existence of an effect to detect. Statistical power ranges from 0 to 1, and as the power of a test increases, the probability \n  \n    \n      \n        β\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta }\n  \n of making a type II error by wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis decreases.","image":"43910602a221b7a4c373791f94793e3008622070.svg"}
