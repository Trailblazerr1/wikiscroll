{"title":"Power of a test","summary":"The statistical power of a binary hypothesis test is the probability that the test correctly rejects the null hypothesis ( H 0 {\\displaystyle H_{0}} ) when a specific alternative hypothesis ( H 1 {\\displaystyle H_{1}} ) is true. It is commonly denoted by 1 − β {\\displaystyle 1-\\beta } , and represents the chances of a \"true positive\" detection conditional on the actual existence of an effect to detect. Statistical power ranges from 0 to 1, and as the power of a test increases, the probability β {\\displaystyle \\beta } of making a type II error by wrongly failing to reject the null hypothesis decreases.","image":"43910602a221b7a4c373791f94793e3008622070.svg","url":"Power_of_a_test"}
