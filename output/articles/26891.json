{"title":"List of longest rivers of the United States (by main stem)","summary":"The longest rivers of the United States include 38 that have main stems of at least 500 miles (800 km) long. The main stem is \"the primary downstream segment of a river, as contrasted to its tributaries\".[1] The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines a main-stem segment by listing coordinates for its two end points, called the source and the mouth. Some well-known rivers like the Atchafalaya,[2] Willamette,[3] and Susquehanna[4] are not included in this list because their main stems are shorter than 500 miles.","image":"Mississippiriver-new-01.png.webp"}
