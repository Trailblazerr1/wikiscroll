{"title":"Narcotic","summary":"The term narcotic (/nɑːrˈkɒtɪk/, from ancient Greek ναρκῶ narkō, \"to make numb\") originally referred medically to any psychoactive compound with numbing or paralyzing properties.[1] In the United States, it has since become associated with opiates and opioids, commonly morphine and heroin, as well as derivatives of many of the compounds found within raw opium latex. The primary three are morphine, codeine, and thebaine (while thebaine itself is only very mildly psychoactive, it is a crucial precursor in the vast majority of semi-synthetic opioids, such as oxycodone or hydrocodone).","image":"Bayer_Heroin_bottle.jpg.webp"}
