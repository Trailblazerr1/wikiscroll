{"title":"Haast's eagle","summary":"The Haast's eagle (Hieraaetus moorei) is an extinct species of eagle that once lived in the South Island of New Zealand, commonly accepted to be the pouakai of Maori legend.[1] It was the largest eagle known to have existed, with an estimated weight of 15 kilograms (33 lb), compared to the 9 kg (20 lb) harpy eagle.[2] Its massive size is explained as an evolutionary response to the size of its prey, the flightless moa, the largest of which could weigh 230 kg (510 lb).[3] Haast's eagle became extinct around 1400, after the moa were hunted to extinction by the first Māori.[4]","image":"Canterbury_Museum%2C_Christchurch_-_Joy_of_Museums_-_Haast's_Eagle.jpg.webp","url":"Haast's_eagle"}
