{"title":"Liberté, égalité, fraternité","summary":"Liberté, égalité, fraternité (French pronunciation: [libɛʁˈte eɡaliˈte fʁatɛʁniˈte]), French for \"liberty, equality, fraternity\",[1] is the national motto of France and the Republic of Haiti, and is an example of a tripartite motto. Although it finds its origins in the French Revolution, it was then only one motto among others and was not institutionalized until the Third Republic at the end of the 19th century.[2] Debates concerning the compatibility and order of the three terms began at the same time as the Revolution. It is also the motto of the Grand Orient and the Grande Loge de France.","image":"Logo_RF.svg.png.webp","url":"Liberté,_égalité,_fraternité"}
