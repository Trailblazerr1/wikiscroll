{"title":"Tamaraw","summary":"The tamaraw or Mindoro dwarf buffalo (Bubalus mindorensis) is a small hoofed mammal belonging to the family Bovidae.[3] It is endemic to the island of Mindoro in the Philippines, and is the only endemic Philippine bovine. It is believed, however, to have once also thrived on the larger island of Luzon.  The tamaraw was originally found all over Mindoro, from sea level up to the mountains (2000Â m above sea level), but because of human habitation, hunting, and logging, it is now restricted to only a few remote grassy plains and is now a critically endangered species.[1]","image":"Tamaraw_(Inside_Philippine_National_Museum_of_Natural_History).jpg.webp","url":"Tamaraw"}
