{"title":"Methanogenesis","summary":"Methanogenesis or biomethanation is the formation of methane by microbes known as methanogens. Organisms capable of producing methane have been identified only from the domain Archaea, a group phylogenetically distinct from both eukaryotes and bacteria, although many live in close association with anaerobic bacteria. The production of methane is an important and widespread form of microbial metabolism. In anoxic environments, it is the final step in the decomposition of biomass.  Methanogenesis is responsible for significant amounts of natural gas accumulations, the remainder being thermogenic.[1][2][3]","image":"Methanogenesis_cycle.png.webp","url":"Methanogenesis"}
