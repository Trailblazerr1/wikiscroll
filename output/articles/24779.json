{"title":"Kim Peek","summary":"Laurence Kim Peek (November 11, 1951 – December 19, 2009) was an American savant. Known as a \"megasavant\",[1][2][3] he had an exceptional memory, but he also experienced social difficulties, possibly resulting from a developmental disability related to congenital brain abnormalities. He was the inspiration for the character Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 movie Rain Man. Although Peek was previously diagnosed with autism, he is now thought  to have had FG syndrome.[4][5] The Utah Film Center’s Peek Award honors his legacy.[6]","image":"Kim_Peek_on_Jan_16%2C_2007.png.webp"}
