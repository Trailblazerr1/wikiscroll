{"title":"Atomic nucleus","summary":"The atomic nucleus is the small, dense region consisting of protons and neutrons at the center of an atom, discovered in 1911 by Ernest Rutherford based on the 1909 Geigerâ€“Marsden gold foil experiment.  After the discovery of the neutron in 1932, models for a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons were quickly developed by Dmitri Ivanenko[1] and Werner Heisenberg.[2][3][4][5][6]  An atom is composed of a positively-charged nucleus, with a cloud of negatively-charged electrons surrounding it, bound together by electrostatic force.  Almost all of the mass of an atom is located in the nucleus, with a very small contribution from the electron cloud.  Protons and neutrons are bound together to form a nucleus by the nuclear force.","image":"NuclearReaction.svg.png.webp","url":"Atomic_nucleus"}
