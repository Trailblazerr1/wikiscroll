{"title":"Age of Discovery","summary":"The Age of Discovery (or the Age of Exploration) is an informal and loosely defined term for the early modern period, largely overlapping with the Age of Sail, approximately from the 15th century to the 18th century in European history, in which seafaring Europeans explored regions across the globe, most of which were already inhabited. More recently some scholars call it the Contact Period[1] or Age of European expansion.[2]","image":"Caravela_Vera_Cruz.jpg.webp","url":"Age_of_Discovery"}
