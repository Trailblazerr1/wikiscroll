{"title":"Pudendal nerve","summary":"The pudendal nerve is the main nerve of the perineum.[1]: 274  It carries sensation from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well as the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter. If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, lesions may cause sensory loss or fecal incontinence. The nerve may be temporarily blocked as part of an anaesthetic procedure.","image":"Pudendal_nerve.svg.png.webp","url":"Pudendal_nerve"}
