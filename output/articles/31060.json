{"title":"Möbius strip","summary":"In mathematics, a Möbius strip, band, or loop (US: /ˈmoʊbiəs, ˈmeɪ-/ MOH-bee-əs, MAY-, UK: /ˈmɜːbiəs/;[1] German: [ˈmøːbi̯ʊs]), also spelled Mobius or Moebius, is a surface with only one side (when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and only one boundary curve. The Möbius strip is the simplest non-orientable surface. It can be realized as a ruled surface. Its discovery is attributed independently to the German mathematicians Johann Benedict Listing and August Ferdinand Möbius in 1858,[2][3][4][5] though similar structures can be seen in Roman mosaics c. 200–250 AD.[6][7] Möbius published his results in his articles \"Theorie der elementaren Verwandtschaft\" (1863) and \"Ueber die Bestimmung des Inhaltes eines Polyëders\" (1865).[8]","image":"Möbius_strip.jpg.webp","url":"Möbius_strip"}
