{"title":"Tetanus","summary":"Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a bacterial infection characterized by muscle spasms.[1] In the most common type, the spasms begin in the jaw and then progress to the rest of the body.[1] Each spasm usually lasts a few minutes.[1] Spasms occur frequently for three to four weeks.[1] Some spasms may be severe enough to fracture bones.[6] Other symptoms of tetanus may include fever, sweating, headache, trouble swallowing, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate.[1][6] Onset of symptoms is typically three to twenty-one days following infection.[1] Recovery may take months.[1] About ten percent of cases prove to be fatal.[1]","image":"Opisthotonus_in_a_patient_suffering_from_tetanus_-_Painting_by_Sir_Charles_Bell_-_1809.jpg.webp","url":"Tetanus"}
