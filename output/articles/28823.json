{"title":"Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)","summary":"The Mass Rapid Transit system, known by the initialism MRT in common parlance, is a rapid transit system in Singapore and the island country's principal mode of railway transportation. The system commenced operations in November 1987 after two decades of planning with an initial 6-kilometre (3.7Â mi) stretch consisting of 5 stations. The network has since grown to span the length and breadth of the city-state's main island (with the exception of the forested core and the rural northwestern region) in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country's public transportation system,[note 10] averaging a daily ridership of 3.4 million in 2019.[note 11][1]","image":"Logo_of_Singapore_MRT.svg.png.webp","url":"Mass_Rapid_Transit_(Singapore)"}
