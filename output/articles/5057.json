{"title":"Autotroph","summary":"An autotroph or primary producer is an organism that produces complex organic compounds (such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) using carbon from simple substances such as carbon dioxide,[1] generally using energy from light (photosynthesis) or inorganic chemical reactions (chemosynthesis).[2] They convert an abiotic source of energy (e.g. light) into energy stored in organic compounds, which can be used by other organisms (e.g. heterotrophs).  Autotrophs do not need a living source of carbon or energy and are the producers in a food chain, such as plants on land or algae in water (in contrast to heterotrophs as consumers of autotrophs or other heterotrophs).  Autotrophs can reduce carbon dioxide to make organic compounds for biosynthesis and as stored chemical fuel.  Most autotrophs use water as the reducing agent, but some can use other hydrogen compounds such as hydrogen sulfide.","image":"Auto-and_heterotrophs.png.webp","url":"Autotroph"}
