{"title":"Dicynodont","summary":"Dicynodontia is an extinct clade of anomodont therapsids. Dicynodonts were herbivorous animals with a pair of tusks, hence their name, which means 'two dog tooth'. Members of the group possessed a horny, typically toothless beak, unique amongst synapsids. Dicynodonts first appeared during the mid-Permian, and became dominant in the Late Permian, they were devastated by the end-Permian Extinction that wiped out most other therapsids, before rebounding during the Triassic, dying out towards the end of the period. They were the most successful and diverse of the non-mammalian therapsids, with over 70 genera known, varying from rat- to elephant-sized.","image":"Iziko_Diictodon_Hibernating_Pair.JPG.webp","url":"Dicynodont"}
