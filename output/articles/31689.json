{"title":"Nero","summary":"Nero (/ˈnɪəroʊ/ NEER-oh; full name: Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus; 15 December 37 – 9 June 68 AD) was the fifth emperor of Rome. He was adopted by the Roman emperor Claudius at the age of thirteen, and succeeded him to the throne. Nero seems to have been popular with his Praetorian guards, and with lower-class commoners in Rome and the provinces, but was deeply resented by the Roman aristocracy. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent and debauched. He was overthrown by his Senate and committed suicide aged 30, last emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.","image":"Nero-black.png.webp"}
