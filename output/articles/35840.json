{"title":"Premature ejaculation","summary":"Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man expels semen (and most likely experiences orgasm) soon after beginning sexual activity, and with minimal penile stimulation. It has also been called early ejaculation, rapid ejaculation, rapid climax, premature climax and (historically) ejaculatio praecox. There is no uniform cut-off defining \"premature\", but a consensus of experts at the International Society for Sexual Medicine endorsed a definition of around one minute after penetration.[1] The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) applies a cut-off of 15 seconds from the beginning of sexual intercourse.[1]","image":"Lock-green.svg.png.webp","url":"Premature_ejaculation"}
