{"title":"Ford (crossing)","summary":"A ford is a shallow place with good footing where a river or stream may be crossed by wading, or inside a vehicle getting its wheels wet.[1] A ford may occur naturally or be constructed. Fords may be impassable during high water. A low water crossing is a low bridge that allows crossing over a river or stream when water is low but may be covered by deep water when the river is high.","image":"Rawney_Ford_(geograph_4388083).jpg.webp","url":"Ford_(crossing)"}
