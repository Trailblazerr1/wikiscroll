{"title":"Yogachara","summary":"Yogachara (IAST: Yogācāra; literally \"yoga practice\"; \"one whose practice is yoga\")[1] is an influential tradition of Buddhist philosophy and psychology emphasizing the study of cognition, perception, and consciousness through the interior lens of meditative and yogic practices.[2][3] It is also variously termed Vijñānavāda (the doctrine of consciousness), Vijñaptivāda (the doctrine of ideas or percepts) or Vijñaptimātratā-vāda (the doctrine of 'mere representation), which is also the name given to its major epistemic theory. There are several interpretations of this main theory, some scholars see it as a kind of Idealism while others argue that it is closer to a kind of phenomenology or representationalism, aimed at deconstructing the reification of our perceptions.","image":"Buddha-flower-color_(fill_color_d2d200).svg.png.webp"}
