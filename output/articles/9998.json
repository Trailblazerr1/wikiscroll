{"title":"Churches of Christ","summary":"The Churches of Christ are autonomous Christian congregations associated with one another through distinct beliefs and practices based on their interpretation of the Bible. Represented in the United States and one of several branches across the world, they believe in using only Bible texts for their doctrine and practices, citing examples from the early Christian church as described in the New Testament. Most typically, their distinguishing beliefs are that of adult baptismal regeneration and the prohibition of instruments in worship. They identify themselves as being nondenominational.[10]","image":"Family-bible.jpg.webp","url":"Churches_of_Christ"}
