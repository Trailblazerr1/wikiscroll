{"title":"Hellenistic period","summary":"The Hellenistic period spans the period of Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire, as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC[1] and the conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year.[2] The period of Greece prior to the Hellenistic era is known as Classical Greece, while the period afterwards is known as Roman Greece. The Ancient Greek word Hellas (Ἑλλάς, Ellás) was originally the widely recognized name of Greece, from which the word Hellenistic was derived.[3] \"Hellenistic\" is distinguished from \"Hellenic\" in that the first encompasses all territories under direct ancient Greek influence, while the latter refers to Greece itself. Instead, the term \"Hellenistic\" refers to that which is influenced by Greek culture, in this case, the East after the conquests of Alexander the Great.","image":"Nike_of_Samothrake_Louvre_Ma2369_n4.jpg.webp","url":"Hellenistic_period"}
