{"title":"Glutamic acid","summary":"Glutamic acid (symbol Glu or E;[4] the ionic form is known as glutamate) is an α-amino acid that is used by almost all living beings in the biosynthesis of proteins. It is non-essential in humans, meaning that the body can synthesize it. It is also an excitatory neurotransmitter, in fact the most abundant one, in the vertebrate nervous system. It serves as the precursor for the synthesis of the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in GABA-ergic neurons.","image":"L-Glutaminsäure_-_L-Glutamic_acid.svg.png.webp","url":"Glutamic_acid"}
