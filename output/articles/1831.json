{"title":"A priori and a posteriori","summary":"A priori and a posteriori ('from the earlier' and 'from the later', respectively) are Latin phrases used in philosophy to distinguish types of knowledge, justification, or argument by their reliance on empirical evidence or experience. A priori knowledge is that which is independent from experience. Examples include mathematics,[lower-roman 1] tautologies, and deduction from pure reason.[lower-roman 2] A posteriori knowledge is that which depends on empirical evidence. Examples include most fields of science and aspects of personal knowledge.","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"A_priori_and_a_posteriori"}
