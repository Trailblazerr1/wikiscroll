{"title":"Muhammad in Islam","summary":"Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbdul-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim (Arabic: مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ عَبْدِ ٱللهِ بْنِ عَبْدِ ٱلْمُطَّلِبِ بْنِ هَاشِمٍ‎) (c.570 – 8 June 632 CE), commonly known as Muhammad, is believed to be the seal of the Messengers and Prophets of God in all the main branches of Islam. Muslims believe that the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, was revealed to Muhammad by God, and that Muhammad was sent to restore Islam, which they believe did not originate with Muhammad but is the true unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.[2][3][4][5] The religious, social, and political tenets that Muhammad established with the Quran became the foundation of Islam and the Muslim world.[6]","image":"Calligraphic_representation_of_Muhammad's_name.jpg.webp","url":"Muhammad_in_Islam"}
