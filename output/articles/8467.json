{"title":"Cape Canaveral","summary":"Cape Canaveral (Spanish: Cabo Ca√±averal) is a prominent cape in Brevard County, Florida, in the United States, near the center of the state's Atlantic coast. Officially Cape Kennedy from 1963 to 1973, it lies east of Merritt Island, separated from it by the Banana River. It is part of a region known as the Space Coast, and is the site of the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. Since many U.S. spacecraft have been launched from both the station and the Kennedy Space Center on adjacent Merritt Island, the two are sometimes conflated with each other.","image":"Cape_canaveral.jpg.webp","url":"Cape_Canaveral"}
