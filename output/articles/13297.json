{"title":"Dog type","summary":"Dog types are broad categories of domestic dogs based on form, function or style of work, lineage, or appearance. Some may be locally adapted dog types (or landraces) that may have the visual characteristics of a modern purebred dog. In contrast, modern dog breeds strictly adhere to long established breed standards,[note 1] that began with documented foundation breeding stock sharing a common set of inheritable characteristics,[1][2] developed by long established, reputable kennel clubs that recognize the dog as a purebred.","image":"Pup-mobile01.jpg.webp","url":"Dog_type"}
