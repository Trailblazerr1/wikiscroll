{"title":"English cuisine","summary":"English cuisine encompasses the cooking styles, traditions and recipes associated with England. It has distinctive attributes of its own, but also shares much with wider British cuisine, partly through the importation of ingredients and ideas from the Americas, China, and India during the time of the British Empire and as a result of post-war immigration.","image":"Tea_at_the_Rittenhouse_Hotel.jpg.webp","url":"English_cuisine"}
