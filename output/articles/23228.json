{"title":"Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs","summary":"The beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses are based on the Bible teachings of Charles Taze Russell—founder of the Bible Student movement—and successive presidents of the Watch Tower Society, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, and Nathan Homer Knorr.[1][2][3] Since 1976 all doctrinal decisions have been made by the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses,[4] a group of elders at the denomination's headquarters. These teachings are disseminated through The Watchtower magazine and other publications of Jehovah's Witnesses, and at conventions and congregation meetings.[5]","image":"JW_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
