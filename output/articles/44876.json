{"title":"Thermodynamic potential","summary":"A thermodynamic potential (or more accurately, a thermodynamic potential energy)[1][2] is a scalar quantity used to represent the thermodynamic state of a system. The concept of thermodynamic potentials was introduced by Pierre Duhem in 1886. Josiah Willard Gibbs in his papers used the term fundamental functions. One main thermodynamic potential that has a physical interpretation is the internal energy U. It is the energy of configuration of a given system of conservative forces (that is why it is called potential) and only has meaning with respect to a defined set of references (or data). Expressions for all other thermodynamic energy potentials are derivable via Legendre transforms from an expression for U. In thermodynamics, external forces, such as gravity, are counted as contributing to total energy rather than to thermodynamic potentials. For example, the working fluid in a steam engine has higher total energy due to gravity while sitting on top of Mount Everest than it has at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, because the gravitational potential energy belongs to the total energy rather to thermodynamic potentials such as internal energy. In a large system under even homogeneous external force, like the earth atmosphere under gravity, the intensive parameters ( p , T , œÅ {\\displaystyle p,T,\\rho } , i.e. pressure, temperature, and density respectively) should be studied locally having even in equilibrium different values in different places far from each other (see thermodynamic models of troposphere).","image":"0e8bc6cf8d2bacfeb899df15760037162edd50ce.svg","url":"Thermodynamic_potential"}
