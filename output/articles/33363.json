{"title":"Osamu Tezuka","summary":"Osamu Tezuka (手塚 治虫, b. 手塚 治, Tezuka Osamu; (1928-11-03)3 November 1928 – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, and animator. Born in Osaka Prefecture, his prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as \"the Father of Manga\" (マンガの父, Manga no Chichi), \"the Godfather of Manga\" (マンガの教父, Manga no Kyōfu) and \"the God of Manga\" (マンガの神様, Manga no Kami-sama). Additionally, he is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, who served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.[1] Though this phrase praises the quality of his early manga works for children and animations, it also blurs the significant influence of his later, more literary, gekiga works.","image":"Osamu_Tezuka_1951_Scan10008-2.JPG.webp","url":"Osamu_Tezuka"}
