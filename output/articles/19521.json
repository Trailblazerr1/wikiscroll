{"title":"Han dynasty","summary":"The Han dynasty (Chinese: 漢朝; pinyin: Hàncháo) was the second imperial dynasty of China (202 BC–220 AD), established by Liu Bang and ruled by the House of Liu.  Preceded by the short-lived Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) and a warring interregnum known as the Chu–Han contention (206–202 BC), it was briefly interrupted by the Xin dynasty (9–23 AD) established by the usurping regent Wang Mang, and was separated into two periods—the Western Han (202 BC–9 AD) and the Eastern Han (25–220 AD)—before being succeeded by the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD). Spanning over four centuries, the Han dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history, and influenced the identity of the Chinese civilization ever since.[4] Modern China's majority ethnic group refers to themselves as the \"Han people\", the Sinitic language is known as \"Han language\", and the written Chinese is referred to as \"Han characters\".[5]","image":"Inscription_on_Imperial_Seal_of_China_\"受命於天_既壽永昌\".svg.png.webp"}
