{"title":"Suffragette","summary":"A suffragette was a member of an activist women's organisation in the early 20th century who, under the banner \"Votes for Women\", fought for the right to vote in public elections. The term refers in particular to members of the British Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), a women-only movement founded in 1903 by Emmeline Pankhurst, which engaged in direct action and civil disobedience.[1][2] In 1906, a reporter writing in the Daily Mail coined the term suffragette for the WSPU, derived from suffragistÎ± (any person advocating for voting rights), in order to belittle the women advocating women's suffrage.[3] The militants embraced the new name, even adopting it for use as the title of the newspaper published by the WSPU.[3]","image":"Suffragette_flag_(United_Kingdom).svg.png.webp"}
