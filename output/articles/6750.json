{"title":"Bitches Brew","summary":"Bitches Brew is the twenty-seventh full-length studio album by American jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, released on March 30, 1970 on Columbia Records. It marked his continuing experimentation with electric instruments that he had featured on his previous record, the critically acclaimed In a Silent Way (1969). With these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis departed from traditional jazz rhythms in favor of loose, rock-influenced arrangements based on improvisation.","image":"Bitches_brew.jpg.webp"}
