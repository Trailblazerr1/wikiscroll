{"title":"Bulldozer","summary":"A  bulldozer or dozer (also called a crawler) is a large, motorized machine that travels on continuous tracks or large tires and is equipped with a metal blade to the front for pushing material: soil, sand, snow, rubble, or rock during construction or conversion work. When needed, a hook-like device (termed a ripper) can be mounted on the rear to loosen dense materials.","image":"Zettelmeyer_ZD_3001.jpg.webp","url":"Bulldozer"}
