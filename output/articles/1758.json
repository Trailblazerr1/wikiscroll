{"title":"ATP synthase","summary":"ATP synthase is a protein that catalyzes the formation of the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi). It is classified under ligases as it changes ADP by the formation of P-O bond (phosphodiester bond). The overall reaction catalyzed by ATP synthase is:","image":"Atp_synthase.PNG.webp"}
