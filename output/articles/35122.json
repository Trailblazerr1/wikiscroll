{"title":"Place name changes in Turkey","summary":"Place name changes in Turkey have been undertaken, periodically, in bulk from 1913 to the present by successive Turkish governments. Thousands of names within the Turkish Republic or its predecessor the Ottoman Empire have been changed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably Turkish names, as part of Turkification policies. The governments have argued that such names are foreign or divisive, while critics of the changes have described them as chauvinistic. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Zazaki, Syriac[1] or Arabic origin.","image":"Enverpascha.jpg.webp","url":"Place_name_changes_in_Turkey"}
