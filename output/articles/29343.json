{"title":"Mennonites","summary":"Mennonites are members of certain Christian groups belonging to the church communities of Anabaptist denominations named after Menno Simons (1496â€“1561) of Friesland. Through his writings, Simons articulated and formalized the teachings of earlier Swiss founders, with the early teachings of the Mennonites founded on the belief in both the mission and ministry of Jesus, which the original Anabaptist followers held with great conviction, despite persecution by various Roman Catholic and Protestant states. An early set of Mennonite beliefs was codified in the Dordrecht Confession of Faith in 1632,[1] but the various groups do not hold to a common confession or creed.","image":"Mennonite_World_Conference_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Mennonites"}
