{"title":"Menai Strait","summary":"The Menai Strait (Welsh: Afon Menai, the \"river Menai\") is a narrow stretch of shallow tidal water about 25 km (16 mi)[1] long, which separates the island of Anglesey from the mainland of Wales. It varies in width from 400 metres (1,300 ft) from Fort Belan to Abermenai Point to 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) from Traeth Gwyllt[2] to Caernarfon Castle. It then narrows to 500 metres (1,600 ft) in the middle reaches (Y Felinheli and Menai Bridge) and then it broadens again. At Bangor, Garth Pier, it is 900 metres (3,000 ft) wide. It then widens out, and the distance from Puffin Island (Welsh: Ynys Seiriol) to Penmaenmawr is about 8 kilometres (5.0 mi).[1]","image":"Menai_Straights.jpg.webp","url":"Menai_Strait"}
