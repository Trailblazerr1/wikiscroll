{"title":"Sargon II","summary":"Sargon II (Neo-Assyrian cuneiform: ,Šarru-kīn,[2][3][4] probably meaning 'the faithful king'[3] or 'the legitimate king')[5] was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from the downfall of his predecessor Shalmaneser V in 722 BC to his death in battle in 705 BC. Though Sargon claimed to be the son of the previous king Tiglath-Pileser III (r. 745–727 BC), this is uncertain and he probably gained the throne through usurping it from Shalmaneser V. Sargon is recognized as one of the most important Neo-Assyrian kings due to his role in founding the Sargonid dynasty, which would rule the Neo-Assyrian Empire until its fall less than a century after Sargon's death.","image":"Sargon_in_Neo-Assyrian2.png.webp"}
