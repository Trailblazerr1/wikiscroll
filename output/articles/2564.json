{"title":"Al-Shabaab (militant group)","summary":"Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (HSM; Arabic: حركة الشباب المجاهدين‎, lit. 'Ḥarakat ash-Shabāb al-Mujāhidīn', Somali: Xarakada Mujaahidiinta Alshabaab, lit. 'Mujahideen Youth Movement' or 'Movement of Striving Youth'), more commonly known as al-Shabaab,[nb 1] is a Somalia-based terrorist jihadist fundamentalist group active in East Africa and Yemen.[11] The group describes itself as waging jihad against \"enemies of Islam\" and is engaged in combat against the Federal Government of Somalia and the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). The group has been suspected of having links with al-Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram. Due to its Wahhabi roots, al-Shabaab is hostile to Sufi traditions[12] and has often clashed with the Somali Sufi militia Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a.[13] Al-Shabaab’s leaders and commanders are mainly from the Hawiye clan, which is one of the largest clans in Somalia.[14] It has attracted some members from Western countries, including Briton Samantha Lewthwaite and American Abu Mansoor Al-Amriki.","image":"ShababLogo.png.webp","url":"Al-Shabaab_(militant_group)"}
