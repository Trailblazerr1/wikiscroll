{"title":"HIM (Finnish band)","summary":"HIM (sometimes stylized as H.I.M.) was a Finnish gothic rock band from Helsinki. First formed in 1991 by vocalist Ville Valo and bassist Mikko \"Mige\" Paananen under the name His Infernal Majesty, the band broke up after only a few years, only to be reformed in 1995 by Valo and guitarist Mikko \"Linde\" Lindström. After being rejoined by Mige, as well as keyboardist Antto Melasniemi and drummer Juhana \"Pätkä\" Rantala, the band, now called HIM, released its debut album Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666 in 1997. In 2000, now with drummer Mika \"Gas Lipstick\" Karppinen and keyboardist Juska Salminen, the band released Razorblade Romance, which reached the number one spot in Finland, Austria and Germany. The first single \"Join Me in Death\" also charted at number one in Finland and Germany, eventually going platinum and gold, respectively. Following the addition of Janne \"Burton\" Puurtinen on keyboards, HIM released Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights (2001) and Love Metal (2003). Both cracked the top ten in several countries and allowed the band to tour in the United Kingdom and the United States for the first time.","image":"HIM_-_Helsinki_Ice_Hall_2017_(2).jpg.webp","url":"HIM_(Finnish_band)"}
