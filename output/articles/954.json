{"title":"90377 Sedna","summary":"Sedna (minor-planet designation 90377 Sedna) is a dwarf planet or large planetoid in the outer reaches of the Solar System that is currently in the innermost part of its orbit; as of 2021 it is 84 astronomical units (1.26×1010 km; 0.00041 pc) from the Sun, almost three times farther than Neptune. Spectroscopy has revealed that Sedna's surface composition is similar to those of some other trans-Neptunian objects, being largely a mixture of water, methane, and nitrogen ices with tholins. Its surface is one of the reddest among Solar System objects. To within estimated uncertainties, Sedna is tied with Ceres as the largest planetoid not known to have a moon.","image":"Sedna_symbol_(Moskowitz%2C_fixed_width).svg.png.webp"}
