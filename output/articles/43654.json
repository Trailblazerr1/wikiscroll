{"title":"Tempura","summary":"Tempura (天ぷら or 天麩羅, tenpura, [tempɯɾa]) is a typical Japanese dish usually consisting of seafood, meat and vegetables that have been battered and deep fried. The dish was introduced by the Portuguese in Nagasaki through the fritter-cooking techniques in the 16th century. The name \"tempura\" may originate from the Portuguese Têmporas, which refer to the Ember Days, during which no meat is consumed,[1] or from the Portuguese word tempêro, meaning “seasoning”.[2]","image":"つな八_盛り付け_(25086067202).jpg.webp"}
