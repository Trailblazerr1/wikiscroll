{"title":"Debugger","summary":"A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program used to test and debug other programs (the \"target\" program). The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under controlled conditions that permit the programmer to track its operations in progress and monitor changes in computer resources (most often memory areas used by the target program or the computer's operating system) that may indicate malfunctioning code. Typical debugging facilities include the ability to run or halt the target program at specific points, display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices (such as disk drives), and modify memory or register contents in order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of faulty program execution.","image":"Winpdb-1.3.6.png.webp","url":"Debugger"}
