{"title":"Taro","summary":"Colocasia esculenta is a tropical plant grown primarily for its edible corms, a root vegetable most commonly known as taro (/ˈtɑːroʊ, ˈtæroʊ/), as yam in Malaysia and Singapore, kalo, dasheen, edo, madhumbe, marope, magogoya, patra, arbi or godere. It is the most widely cultivated species of several plants in the family Araceae that are used as vegetables for their corms, leaves, and petioles. Taro corms are a food staple in African, Oceanic, and South Asian cultures (similar to yams), and taro is believed to have been one of the earliest cultivated plants.","image":"Songe-Réunion.JPG.webp","url":"Taro"}
