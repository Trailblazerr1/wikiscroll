{"title":"Lactation","summary":"Lactation describes the secretion of milk from the mammary glands and the period of time that a mother lactates to feed her young. The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals.[1] The process of feeding milk in all animals (including humans) is called nursing, and in humans it is also called breastfeeding. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as witch's milk.","image":"White_Cat_Nursing_Four_Kittens_HQ.jpg.webp","url":"Lactation"}
