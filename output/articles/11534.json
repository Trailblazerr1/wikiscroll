{"title":"Croissant","summary":"A croissant (UK: /ˈkrwʌsɒ̃, ˈkrwæsɒ̃/,[3] US: /krəˈsɒnt, krwɑːˈsɒ̃/, French: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,[1] but mostly associated with France. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape and, like other viennoiseries, are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.","image":"2018_01_Croissant_IMG_0685.JPG.webp","url":"Croissant"}
