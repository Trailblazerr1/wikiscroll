{"title":"Galápagos tortoise","summary":"The Galápagos tortoise complex or Galápagos giant tortoise complex is a species complex of 15 (13 extant and 2 extinct) very large tortoise species in the genus Chelonoidis (which also contains three other species from mainland South America). They are the largest living species of tortoise, with some modern Galápagos tortoises weighing up to 417 kg (919 lb).[2] With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, they are one of the longest-lived vertebrates. Captive Galapagos tortoises can live up to 177 years.[3] For example, a captive individual,  Harriet, lived for at least 175 years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish galápago, meaning \"tortoise\".[4]","image":"Galapagos_giant_tortoise_Geochelone_elephantopus.jpg.webp","url":"Galápagos_tortoise"}
