{"title":"Stateless society","summary":"A stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state.[1] In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.[2] Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.[3]","image":"World_in_1000_BCE.png.webp"}
