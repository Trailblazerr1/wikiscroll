{"title":"Mantoux test","summary":"The Mantoux test or Mendelâ€“Mantoux test (also known as the Mantoux screening test, tuberculin sensitivity test, Pirquet test, or PPD test for purified protein derivative) is a tool for screening for tuberculosis (TB) and for tuberculosis diagnosis. It is one of the major tuberculin skin tests used around the world, largely replacing multiple-puncture tests such as the tine test. The Heaf test, a form of tine test, was used until 2005 in the UK, when it was replaced by the Mantoux test. The Mantoux test is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It was also used in the USSR and is now prevalent in most of the post-Soviet states.","image":"Mantoux_tuberculin_skin_test.jpg.webp","url":"Mantoux_test"}
