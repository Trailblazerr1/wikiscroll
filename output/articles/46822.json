Founded in 1209[9] and granted a royal charter by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university.[10] The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a dispute with the townspeople.[11] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge.","image":"University_of_Cambridge_coat_of_arms.svg.png.webp","url":"University_of_Cambridge"}
