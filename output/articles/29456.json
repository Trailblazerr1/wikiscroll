{"title":"Messerschmitt Me 262","summary":"The Messerschmitt Me 262, nicknamed Schwalbe (German: \"Swallow\") in fighter versions, or Sturmvogel (German: \"Storm Bird\") in fighter-bomber versions, was the world's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft. Design work started before World War II began, but problems with engines, metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944. The Me 262 was faster and more heavily armed than any Allied fighter, including the British jet-powered Gloster Meteor.[5] One of the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War II,[6] the Me 262's roles included light bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions.","image":"Messerschmitt_Me_262A_at_the_National_Museum_of_the_USAF.jpg.webp"}
