{"title":"Subcutaneous emphysema","summary":"Subcutaneous emphysema (SCE, SE) occurs when gas or air travels under the skin. Subcutaneous refers to the tissue beneath the skin, and emphysema refers to trapped air. Since the air generally comes from the chest cavity, subcutaneous emphysema usually occurs on the chest, neck and face, where it is able to travel from the chest cavity along the fascia.[1] Subcutaneous emphysema has a characteristic crackling-feel to the touch, a sensation that has been described as similar to touching warm Rice Krispies.[2] This sensation of air under the skin is known as subcutaneous crepitation, a form of Crepitus.","image":"Subcutaneous_emphysema_abdomen_arrows2.jpg.webp","url":"Subcutaneous_emphysema"}
