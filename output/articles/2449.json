{"title":"Ahmadiyya","summary":"Ahmadiyya (/ˌɑːməˈdiːə/, also UK: /-ˈdiːjə/),[1][2][3] officially the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community[4] or the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at (Arabic: الجماعة الإسلامية الأحمدية‎, romanized: al-Jamāʿah al-Islāmīyah al-Aḥmadīyah; Urdu: جماعت احمدیہ مسلمہ‎, romanized: Jamā'at Aḥmadiyyah Muslimah), is an Islamic revival[5] or messianic[6] movement originating in Punjab, British India, in the late 19th century.[7][8][9] It was founded by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835–1908), who claimed to have been divinely appointed as both the Promised Mahdi (Guided One) and Messiah expected by Muslims to appear towards the end times and bring about, by peaceful means, the final triumph of Islam;[10] as well as to embody, in this capacity, the expected eschatological figure of other major religious traditions.[11] Adherents of the Ahmadiyya—a term adopted expressly in reference to Muhammad's alternative name Aḥmad[12][13][14][15]—are known as Ahmadi Muslims or simply Ahmadis.","image":"Liwa-e-Ahmadiyya_1-2.svg.png.webp"}
