{"title":"Operation Blue Star","summary":"Operation Blue Star was the codename of a military operation carried out by Indian security forces between 1 and 10 June 1984 in order to remove Damdami Taksal leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his followers from the buildings of the Golden Temple, a holy site for Sikhs located in Amritsar, Punjab, India. The decision to launch the operation rested with the erstwhile Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi,[26] who had already authorized military preparation for a confrontation at the temple complex 18 months prior according to the then-Vice Chief of the Army Staff, S. K. Sinha.[27] In July 1982, Harchand Singh Longowal, the president of the Sikh political party Shiromani Akali Dal, had invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in the Golden Temple to evade arrest by government authorities.[28][29]","image":"Operation_Bluestar_Aftermath_on_Akal_Takht.jpg.webp"}
