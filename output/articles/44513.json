{"title":"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion","summary":"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (Протоколы сионских мудрецов) or The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion is a fabricated antisemitic text purporting to describe a Jewish plan for global domination. The hoax was plagiarized from several earlier sources, some not antisemitic in nature.[1] It was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century. It played a key part in popularizing belief in an international Jewish conspiracy.","image":"1905_2fnl_Velikoe_v_malom_i_antikhrist.jpg.webp","url":"The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion"}
