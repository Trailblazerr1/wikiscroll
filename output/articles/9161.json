{"title":"Cetacean surfacing behaviour","summary":"Cetacean surfacing behaviour or breaching is a group of behaviours demonstrated by the Cetacea infraorder when they come to the water's surface to breathe. Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive; some species have been known to dive for up to 85 minutes at a time when hunting,[1] and dives in excess of three hours have been observed in Cuvier's beaked whale under extreme circumstances.[2]","image":"Southern_right_whale.jpg.webp"}
