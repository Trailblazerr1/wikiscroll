{"title":"Haskell (programming language)","summary":"Haskell (/ˈhæskəl/[27]) is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.[28][29] Designed for teaching, research and industrial application, Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features such as type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading. Haskell's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). It is named after logician Haskell Curry.[1]","image":"Logo_of_the_Haskell_programming_language.svg.png.webp","url":"Haskell_(programming_language)"}
