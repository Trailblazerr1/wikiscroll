{"title":"Greatest Hits (Queen album)","summary":"Greatest Hits is a compilation album by the British rock band Queen, released worldwide on 26 October 1981.[1] The album consisted of Queen's biggest hits since their first chart appearance in 1974 with \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", up to their 1980 hit \"Flash\" (though in some countries \"Under Pressure\", the band's 1981 chart-topper with David Bowie, was included). There was no universal track listing or cover art for the album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles had been released there and which were successful. In 1992, the US version of the album Classic Queen was released following the band's rekindled popularity in the nation.[2]","image":"Queen_Greatest_Hits.png.webp","url":"Greatest_Hits_(Queen_album)"}
