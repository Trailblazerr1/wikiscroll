{"title":"IS–LM model","summary":"The IS–LM model, or Hicks–Hansen model, is a  two-dimensional macroeconomic tool that shows the relationship between interest rates and assets market (also known as real output in goods and services market plus money market). The intersection of the \"investment–saving\" (IS) and \"liquidity preference–money supply\" (LM) curves models \"general equilibrium\" where supposed simultaneous equilibria occur in both the goods and the asset markets.[1] Yet two equivalent interpretations are possible: first, the IS–LM model explains changes in national income when the price level is fixed in the short-run; second, the IS–LM model shows why an aggregate demand curve can shift.[2]\nHence, this tool is sometimes used not only to analyse economic fluctuations but also to suggest potential levels for appropriate stabilisation policies.[3]","image":"Islm.svg.png.webp"}
