{"title":"2011 Egyptian revolution","summary":"The 2011 Egyptian revolution, also known as the 25 January revolution (Arabic: ثورة ٢٥ يناير‎; Thawrat khamsa wa-ʿišrūn yanāyir),[21] began on 25 January 2011 and spread across Egypt. The date was set by various youth groups to coincide with the annual Egyptian \"Police holiday\" as a statement against increasing police brutality during the last few years of Hosni Mubarak's presidency. It consisted of demonstrations, marches, occupations of plazas, non-violent civil resistance, acts of civil disobedience and strikes. Millions of protesters from a range of socio-economic and religious backgrounds demanded the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Violent clashes between security forces and protesters resulted in at least 846 people killed and over 6,000 injured.[22][23] Protesters retaliated by burning over 90 police stations across the country.[24]","image":"Tahrir_Square_during_8_February_2011.jpg.webp","url":"2011_Egyptian_revolution"}
