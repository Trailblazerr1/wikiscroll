{"title":"Unitarian Universalism","summary":"Unitarian Universalism (UU)[2][3][4] is a liberal religion characterized by a \"free and responsible search for truth and meaning\".[5][6] Unitarian Universalists assert no creed, but instead are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth, guided by a dynamic, \"living tradition\". Currently, these traditions are summarized by the Six Sources and Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalism, documents recognized by all congregations who choose to be a part of the Unitarian Universalist Association. These documents are 'living', meaning always open for revisiting and reworking. Unitarian Universalist (U.U.) congregations include many atheists, agnostics, and theists within their membership. There are U.U. churches, fellowships, congregations, and societies around the world. The roots of Unitarian Universalism lie in liberal Christianity, specifically unitarianism and universalism. Unitarian Universalists state that from these traditions comes a deep regard for intellectual freedom and inclusive love. Congregations and members seek inspiration and derive insight from all major world religions.[7]","image":"Flaming_Chalice.svg.png.webp","url":"A%2fUnitarian_Universalism"}
