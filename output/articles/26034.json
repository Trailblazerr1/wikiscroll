{"title":"Li (unit)","summary":"Li (Chinese: 里, lǐ, or 市里, shìlǐ), also known as the Chinese mile, is a traditional Chinese unit of distance. The li has varied considerably over time but was usually about one third of an English mile and now has a standardized length of a half-kilometer (500 meters or 1,640 feet). This is then divided into 1,500 chi or \"Chinese feet\".","image":"Anping_Bridge_-_west-central_part_-_looking_west_-_DSCF9094.JPG.webp"}
