{"title":"Holocene","summary":"The Holocene ( /ˈhɒl.əˌsiːn, ˈhɒl.oʊ-, ˈhoʊ.lə-, ˈhoʊ.loʊ-/ HOL-ə-seen, HOL-oh-, HOH-lə-, HOH-loh-)[2][3] is the current geological epoch. It began approximately 11,650  cal years before present, after the last glacial period, which concluded with the Holocene glacial retreat.[4] The Holocene and the preceding Pleistocene[5] together form the Quaternary period. The Holocene has been identified with the current warm period, known as MIS 1. It is considered by some to be an interglacial period within the Pleistocene Epoch, called the Flandrian interglacial.[6]","image":"Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png.webp"}
