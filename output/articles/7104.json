{"title":"Bodyline","summary":"Bodyline, also known as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932â€“33 Ashes tour of Australia. It was designed to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's leading batsman, Don Bradman. A bodyline delivery was one in which the cricket ball was bowled, at pace, at the body of the batsman in the expectation that when he defended himself with his bat a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by on the leg side.","image":"4th_Test_Woodfull.jpg.webp"}
