{"title":"Ubuntu philosophy","summary":"Ubuntu (Zulu pronunciation: [ùɓúntʼù])[1] is a Nguni Bantu term meaning \"humanity\". It is sometimes translated as \"I am because we are\" (also \"I am because you are\"),[2] or \"humanity towards others\" (in Zulu, umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu). In Xhosa, the latter term is used, but is often meant in a more philosophical sense to mean \"the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity\".[3]","image":"Elephant_parade_ubuntu_1.jpg.webp","url":"Ubuntu_philosophy"}
