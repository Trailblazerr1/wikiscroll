{"title":"Libor","summary":"The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate is an interest-rate average calculated from estimates submitted by the leading banks in London.  Each bank estimates what it would be charged were it to borrow from other banks.[1][lower-alpha 1] The resulting average rate is usually abbreviated to Libor (/ˈlaɪbɔːr/) or LIBOR, or more officially to ICE LIBOR (for Intercontinental Exchange Libor). It was formerly known as BBA Libor (for British Bankers' Association Libor or the trademark bba libor) before the responsibility for the administration was transferred to Intercontinental Exchange. It is the primary benchmark, along with the Euribor, for short-term interest rates around the world.[2][3] Libor will be phased out at the end of 2021, and market participants are being encouraged to transition to risk-free interest rates.[4][5][6]","image":"Londres_353..jpg.webp"}
