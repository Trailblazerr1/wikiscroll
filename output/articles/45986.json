{"title":"Triptan","summary":"Triptans are a family of tryptamine-based drugs used as abortive medication in the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. This drug class was first introduced in the 1990s. While effective at treating individual headaches, they do not provide preventive treatment and are not considered a cure. They are not effective for the treatment of tensionâ€“type headache,[1] except in persons who also experience migraines.[2] Triptans do not relieve other kinds of pain.","image":"Sumatriptan.svg.png.webp"}
