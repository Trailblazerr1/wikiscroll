{"title":"Federal Court of Justice","summary":"The Federal Court of Justice (German: Bundesgerichtshof, BGH)  is the highest court in the system of ordinary jurisdiction (ordentliche Gerichtsbarkeit) in Germany, founded in 1950. It has its seat in Karlsruhe with two panels being situated in Leipzig since 1997 and 2020, respectively. It is the supreme court (court of last resort) in all matters of criminal law and private law. A decision handed down by the BGH can be reversed only by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in the rare cases that the Constitutional Court rules on constitutionality (compatibility with the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany).","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_Germany.svg.png.webp"}
