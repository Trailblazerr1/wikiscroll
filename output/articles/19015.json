{"title":"Grimsby","summary":"Grimsby, also Great Grimsby, is a port town and administrative centre of North East Lincolnshire, England, on the South Bank of the Humber Estuary close to the North Sea. It was the home port for the world's largest fishing fleet by the mid-20th century,[1] but fishing then fell sharply. The Cod Wars denied UK access to Icelandic fishing grounds and the European Union used its Common Fisheries Policy to parcel out fishing quotas to other European countries in waters within 200-nautical-mile (370 km) of the UK coast. Grimsby has since suffered post-industrial decline,[2] but food production has risen since the 1990s. The Grimsby–Cleethorpes conurbation acts as a cultural and economic centre for much of north and east Lincolnshire. Grimsby people are called Grimbarians;[3] the term codhead is also used jokingly, often for football supporters.[4][5][6] Great Grimsby Day is 22 January.[3]","image":"Grimsby%2C_Alexandra_Dock-_aerial_2015_(geograph_4402556).jpg.webp"}
