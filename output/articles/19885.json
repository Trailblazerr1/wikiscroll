{"title":"Heat pump and refrigeration cycle","summary":"Thermodynamic heat pump cycles or refrigeration cycles are the conceptual and mathematical models for heat pump, air conditioning and refrigeration systems. A heat pump is a mechanical system that allows for the transmission of heat from one location (the \"source\") at a lower temperature  to another location (the \"sink\" or \"heat sink\") at a higher temperature.[1]  Thus a heat pump may be thought of as a \"heater\" if the objective is to warm the heat sink (as when warming the inside of a home on a cold day), or a \"refrigerator\" or “cooler” if the objective is to cool the heat source (as in the normal operation of a freezer). In either case, the operating principles are close.[2] Heat is moved from a cold place to a warm place.","image":"Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Heat_pump_and_refrigeration_cycle"}
