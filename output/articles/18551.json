{"title":"Gothic architecture","summary":"Gothic architecture (or pointed architecture) is an architectural style that was popular in Europe from the late 12th to the 16th century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some areas.[1] It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture. It originated in the ÃŽle-de-France region of northern France as a development of Norman architecture.[2] The style at the time was sometimes known as opus Francigenum (lit. French work);[3] the term Gothic was first applied contemptuously during the later Renaissance, by those ambitious to revive the architecture of classical antiquity.","image":"Sainte_Chapelle_Interior_Stained_Glass.jpg.webp","url":"Gothic_architecture"}
