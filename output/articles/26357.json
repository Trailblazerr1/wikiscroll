{"title":"List of Arsenal F.C. players","summary":"Arsenal Football Club, an association football club based in Islington, London, was founded in 1886 as Royal Arsenal. They became the first southern member[nb 1] admitted into the Football League in 1893, having spent their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies.[3] The club's name, which shortly changed to Woolwich Arsenal, was shortened to Arsenal in 1914, a year after moving to Highbury.[4] Despite finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1914â€“15, Arsenal rejoined the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur when football resumed after the First World War.[5] Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight.[6] The club's first team has competed in numerous nationally and internationally organised competitions, and all players who have played in 100 or more such matches are listed below.","image":"Ian_Wright_from_Lee_Dixon_interview_1.jpg.webp"}
