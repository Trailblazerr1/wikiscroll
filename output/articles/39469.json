In the Buddhist tradition, especially Theravada Buddhism, applying mindful attention to four domains, the body, feelings, the mind, and key principles or categories of the Buddha's teaching (dhammās),[1] is thought to aid the elimination of the five hindrances and the development of the seven aspects of wakefulness.","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp"}
