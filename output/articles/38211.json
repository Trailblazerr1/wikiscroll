{"title":"Robert Rauschenberg","summary":"Milton Ernest \"Robert\" Rauschenberg (October 22, 1925 – May 12, 2008) was an American painter and graphic artist whose early works anticipated the Pop art movement. Rauschenberg is well known for his Combines (1954–1964), a group of artworks which incorporated everyday objects as art materials and which blurred the distinctions between painting and sculpture. Rauschenberg was both a painter and a sculptor, but he also worked with photography, printmaking, papermaking and performance.[1][2]","image":"Robert_Rauschenberg_(1968).jpg.webp","url":"Robert_Rauschenberg"}
