{"title":"The Resistance (album)","summary":"The Resistance is the fifth studio album by English rock band Muse. It was released on 14 September 2009 through the band's own Helium-3 imprint as well as Warner Bros. Records. Produced by the band and mixed by Mark Stent,[3][4] the album was recorded from September 2008 to May 2009 at Studio Bellini in Lake Como, Italy. Musically, the record is similar to some of the band's previous material, mixing orchestral elements with rock and electronic music. The album also saw the band craft a three-part, 15-minute long symphony piece titled \"Exogenesis\". Lyrically, it is a concept record, as well as continuation of the themes from their previous records, being influenced by politics and more oppressive subjects.","image":"Theresistance.jpg.webp","url":"The_Resistance_(album)"}
