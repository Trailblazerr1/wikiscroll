{"title":"Blastocyst","summary":"The blastocyst is a structure formed in the early development of mammals. It possesses an inner cell mass (ICM) which subsequently forms the embryo. The outer layer of the blastocyst consists of cells collectively called the trophoblast. This layer surrounds the inner cell mass and a fluid-filled cavity known as the blastocoel. The trophoblast gives rise to the chorion and amnion that surround the embryo. The placenta derives from the embryonic chorion (the portion of the chorion that develops villi) and the underlying uterine tissue of the mother.[1] [2]The name \"blastocyst\" arises from the Greek βλαστός blastos (\"a sprout\") and κύστις kystis (\"bladder, capsule\"). In other animals this is called a blastula.","image":"Blastocyst_English.svg.png.webp"}
