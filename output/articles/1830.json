{"title":"A cappella","summary":"A cappella[nb 1] (/ˌɑː kəˈpɛlə/, also UK: /ˌæ -/, Italian: [a kkapˈpɛlla]; Italian for 'in the style of the chapel')[1] music is a performance by a singer or a singing group without instrumental accompaniment, or a piece intended to be performed in this way. The term a cappella was originally intended to differentiate between Renaissance polyphony and Baroque concertato musical styles. In the 19th century, a renewed interest in Renaissance polyphony coupled with an ignorance of the fact that vocal parts were often doubled by instrumentalists led to the term coming to mean unaccompanied vocal music.[1] The term is also used, rarely, as a synonym for alla breve.[2]","image":"Roskilde_Cathedrals_Boys_Choir.jpg.webp"}
