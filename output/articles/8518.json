{"title":"Captain Marvel (DC Comics)","summary":"Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam (/ʃəˈzæm/), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comics originally published by Fawcett Comics, and currently published by DC Comics. Artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Shazam first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. He is the alter ego of Billy Batson, a boy who, by speaking or thinking the magic word \"SHAZAM!\" (acronym of six \"immortal elders\": Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury), can transform himself into a costumed adult (Powers do not require transformation) with the powers of superhuman strength, speed, flight and other abilities. The character battles an extensive rogues' gallery, most of them working in tandem as the Monster Society of Evil, including primary archenemies Doctor Sivana, Black Adam, and Mister Mind. Billy often shares his powers with other children, primarily his sister Mary Batson and their best friend/foster brother Freddy Freeman, who also transform into superheroes and fight crime with Billy as members of the Marvel Family, also known as the Shazam Family.","image":"Shazam_Captain_Marvel.png.webp","url":"Captain_Marvel_(DC_Comics)"}
