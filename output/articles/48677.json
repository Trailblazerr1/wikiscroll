{"title":"Window","summary":"A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the passage of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air. Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame[1] in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.[2] Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.","image":"Window_of_the_house_with_number_17_on_strada_MÃ¢ntuleasa%2C_from_Bucharest_(Romania).jpg.webp"}
