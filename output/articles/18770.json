{"title":"Great Britain road numbering scheme","summary":"The Great Britain road numbering scheme is a numbering scheme used to classify and identify all roads in Great Britain. \nEach road is given a single letter (which represents the road's category) and a subsequent number (between 1 and 4 digits). Introduced to arrange funding allocations, the numbers soon became used on maps and as a method of navigation. Two sub-schemes exist: one for motorways, and another for non-motorway roads. While some major roads form part of the International E-road network, no E-routes are signposted in Great Britain, or the rest of the UK. Due to changes in local road designation, in some cases roads are numbered out of zone. There are also instances where road numbers in one area are also found in another location. For example the A594 is designated as the Leicester Ring Road and also allocated to a road in Cumbria.","image":"United_Kingdom_A_road_zones.svg.png.webp"}
