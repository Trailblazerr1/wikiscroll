{"title":"Dannii Minogue","summary":"Danielle Jane Minogue (born 20 October 1971)[2][3] is an Australian singer, actress, and television personality. She came to prominence for her appearances on the television talent show Young Talent Time (1982–1988) and went on to play the role of Emma Jackson in the soap opera Home and Away (1989–1990). Minogue began her music career in the early 1990s, achieving early success with her debut studio album, Love and Kisses (1991), which included the singles \"Love and Kisses\", \"Baby Love\", \"Jump to the Beat\" and \"Success\". Following the release of her second studio album, Get into You (1993), Minogue's popularity as a singer had declined, only producing one hit single \"This Is It\". This led her to make a name for herself with award-winning performances in the stage shows Grease (1997), Notre-Dame de Paris (1999), The Vagina Monologues and Macbeth (both 2000).","image":"Dannii_Minogue_arrives_at_the_58th_Annual_Logie_Awards_at_Crown_Palladium_(26904220225)_cropped.jpg.webp"}
