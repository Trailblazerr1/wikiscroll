{"title":"Cryptosporidiosis","summary":"Cryptosporidiosis, sometimes informally called crypto,[1] is a parasitic disease caused by Cryptosporidium, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough.[2] In immunosuppressed individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water;[2][3] recent evidence suggests that it can also be transmitted via fomites contaminated with respiratory secretions.[2]","image":"Cryptosporidiosis_-_very_high_mag_-_cropped.jpg.webp"}
