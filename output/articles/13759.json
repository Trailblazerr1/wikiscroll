{"title":"Dune","summary":"A dune is a landform composed of wind- or water-driven sand. It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or hill.[1] An area with dunes is called a dune system[2][3][4][5] or a dune complex.[6]  A large dune complex is called a dune field,[7] while broad, flat regions covered with wind-swept sand or dunes with little or no vegetation are called ergs or sand seas.[8][9][10] Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, but most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter slip face in the lee side.[11] The valley or trough between dunes is called a dune slack.[12]","image":"Panorama_depanne.jpg.webp"}
