King's was established in 1829 by King George IV and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, when it received its first royal charter (as a university college - though the roots of King's medical school, St. Thomas, date back to the 16th century with recorded first teaching in 1561[2]). King's is one of the oldest universities in England.[7][8] In 1836, King's became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London.[9][10][11] In the late 20th century, King's grew through a series of mergers, including with Queen Elizabeth College and Chelsea College of Science and Technology (in 1985), the Institute of Psychiatry (in 1997), the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals and the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing and Midwifery (in 1998).","image":"Arms_of_King's_College_London.svg.png.webp"}
