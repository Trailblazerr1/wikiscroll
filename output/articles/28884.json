{"title":"Mathematical economics","summary":"Mathematical economics is the application of mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics.  By convention, these applied methods are beyond simple geometry, such as differential and integral calculus, difference and differential equations, matrix algebra, mathematical programming, and other computational methods.[1][2] Proponents of this approach claim that it allows the formulation of theoretical relationships with rigor, generality, and simplicity.[3]","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp","url":"Mathematical_economics"}
