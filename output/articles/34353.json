{"title":"Penguin Books","summary":"Penguin Books was originally a British publishing house. It was co-founded in 1935 by Sir Allen Lane with his brothers Richard and John,[3] as a line of the publishers The Bodley Head, only becoming a separate company the following year.[4] Penguin revolutionised publishing in the 1930s through its inexpensive paperbacks, sold through Woolworths and other high street stores for sixpence, bringing high-quality fiction and non-fiction to the mass market.[5] Its success showed that large audiences existed for serious books. It also had a significant impact on public debate in Britain through its books on culture, politics, the arts, and science.[6]","image":"Penguin_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Penguin_Books"}
