{"title":"List of chief ministers of Chhattisgarh","summary":"The Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh is the chief executive of the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. In accordance with the Constitution of India, the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister. Following elections to the legislative assembly, the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government. The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits.[2]","image":"..Chhattisgarh_Flag(INDIA).png.webp","url":"List_of_chief_ministers_of_Chhattisgarh"}
