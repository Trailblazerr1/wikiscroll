{"title":"Marvel Science Stories","summary":"Marvel Science Stories was an American pulp magazine that ran for a total of fifteen issues in two separate runs, both edited by Robert O. Erisman. The publisher for the first run was Postal Publications, and the second run was published by Western Publishing; both companies were owned by Abraham and Martin Goodman. The first issue was dated August 1938, and carried stories with more sexual content than was usual for the genre, including several stories by Henry Kuttner, under his own name and also under pseudonyms. Reaction was generally negative, with one reader referring to Kuttner's story \"The Time Trap\" as \"trash\". This was the first of several titles featuring the word \"Marvel\", and Marvel Comics came from the same stable in the following year.","image":"Marvel_science_stories_193904-05.jpg.webp","url":"Marvel_Science_Stories"}
