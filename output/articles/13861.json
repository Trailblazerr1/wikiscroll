{"title":"Dyslexia","summary":"Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is a disorder characterized by difficulty reading in individuals with otherwise unaffected intelligence.[1][6] Different people are affected to different degrees.[3] Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, \"sounding out\" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.[3][7] Often these difficulties are first noticed at school.[2] When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as \"alexia\".[3] The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn.[3] People with dyslexia have higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental language disorders, and difficulties with numbers.[2][8] Dyslexia is believed to be caused by the interaction of genetic and environmental factors.[2] Some cases run in families.[3] Dyslexia that develops due to a traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia is called \"acquired dyslexia\".[1] The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia result from differences within the brain's language processing.[3] Dyslexia is diagnosed through a series of tests of memory, vision, spelling, and reading skills.[4] Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching or opportunity to learn.[2]","image":"Dyslexia_handwriting_Greek.jpg.webp","url":"Dyslexia"}
