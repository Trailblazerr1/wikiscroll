{"title":"Styx","summary":"In Greek mythology, Styx (/ˈstɪks/; Ancient Greek: Στύξ [stýks]) is a deity and a river that forms the boundary between Earth (Gaia) and the Underworld. The rivers Acheron, Cocytus, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Styx all converge at the centre of the underworld on a great marsh, which sometimes is also called the Styx. According to Herodotus, the river Styx originates near Pheneus.[4] Styx is also a goddess with prehistoric roots in Greek mythology as a daughter of Tethys, after whom the river is named and because of whom it had miraculous powers.","image":"Paestum_tombe_lucanienne_1.jpg.webp"}
