{"title":"Solvent","summary":"A solvent (from the Latin solv≈ç, \"loosen, untie, solve\") is a substance that dissolves a solute, resulting in a solution. A solvent is usually a liquid but can also be a solid, a gas, or a supercritical fluid. Water is a solvent for polar molecules and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within the cell.","image":"Acetato_de_etilo.jpg.webp","url":"Solvent"}
