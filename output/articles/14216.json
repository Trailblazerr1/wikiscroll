{"title":"Edmund Evans","summary":"Edmund Evans (23 February 1826 â€“ 21 August 1905) was an English wood-engraver and colour printer during the Victorian era. Evans specialized in full-colour printing, which, in part because of his work, became popular in the mid-19th century. He employed and collaborated with illustrators such as Walter Crane, Randolph Caldecott, Kate Greenaway and Richard Doyle to produce what are now considered to be classic children's books. Although little is known about his life, he wrote a short autobiography before his death in 1905 in which he described his life as a printer in Victorian London.","image":"Randolph_Caldecott_illustration2.jpg.webp"}
