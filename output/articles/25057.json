The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.","image":"KRAK_DES_CHEVALIERS_-_GAR_-_6-00.jpg.webp"}
