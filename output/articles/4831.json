{"title":"Atmosphere of Jupiter","summary":"The atmosphere of Jupiter is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. It is mostly made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts and include methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and water. Although water is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere, its directly measured concentration is very low. The nitrogen, sulfur, and noble gas abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three.[2]","image":"Jupiter's_swirling_colourful_clouds.jpg.webp","url":"Atmosphere_of_Jupiter"}
