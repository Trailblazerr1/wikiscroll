{"title":"Pranayama","summary":"Pranayama is the yogic practice of focusing on breath. In Sanskrit, prana means \"vital life force\", and yama means to gain control. In yoga, breath is associated with the prana, thus, pranayama is a means to elevate the prana shakti, or life energies. Pranayama is described in Hindu texts like the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Later in Hatha yoga texts, it meant the complete suspension of breathing.","image":"Nadishodhana_Pranayama_-_International_Day_of_Yoga_Celebration_-_NCSM_-_Kolkata_2017-06-21_2455.JPG.webp","url":"Pranayama"}
