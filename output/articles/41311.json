{"title":"Somaliland","summary":"Somaliland (Somali: Soomaaliland; Arabic: صوماليلاند‎ Ṣūmālīlānd, أرض الصومال‎ Arḍ aṣ-Ṣūmāl), officially the Republic of Somaliland (Somali: Jamhuuriyadda Soomaaliland, Arabic: جمهورية صوماليلاند‎ Jumhūrīyat Ṣūmālīlānd), is a de facto sovereign state in the Horn of Africa, considered by most states[10][11] to be part of Somalia. Somaliland lies in the Horn of Africa, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden. It is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Ethiopia to the south and west, and Somalia to the east.[12] Its claimed territory has an area of 176,120 square kilometres (68,000 sq mi),[13] with approximately 5.7 million residents as of 2021.[14] The capital and largest city is Hargeisa. The government of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to British Somaliland, which, as the briefly independent State of Somaliland, united in 1960 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.[15]","image":"Flag_of_Somaliland.svg.png.webp","url":"Somaliland"}
