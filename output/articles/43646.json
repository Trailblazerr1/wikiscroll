{"title":"Tempo","summary":"In musical terminology, tempo (Italian for \"time\"; plural tempos, or tempi from the Italian plural) is the speed or pace of a given piece. In classical music, tempo is typically indicated with an instruction at the start of a piece (often using conventional Italian terms) and is usually measured in beats per minute (or bpm). In modern classical compositions, a \"metronome mark\" in beats per minute may supplement or replace the normal tempo marking, while in modern genres like electronic dance music, tempo will typically simply be stated in bpm.","image":"Electronic-metronome(scale).jpg.webp","url":"Tempo"}
