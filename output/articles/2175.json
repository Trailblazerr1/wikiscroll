{"title":"Adenocarcinoma","summary":"Adenocarcinoma[1] (/ˌædɪnoʊkɑːrsɪˈnoʊmə/; plural adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinomata /ˌædɪnoʊkɑːrsɪˈnoʊmɪtə/) (AC) is a type of cancerous tumor that can occur in several parts of the body. It is defined as neoplasia of epithelial tissue that has glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenocarcinomas are part of the larger grouping of carcinomas, but are also sometimes called by more precise terms omitting the word, where these exist. Thus invasive ductal carcinoma, the most common form of breast cancer, is adenocarcinoma but does not use the term in its name—however, esophageal adenocarcinoma does to distinguish it from the other common type of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several of the most common forms of cancer are adenocarcinomas, and the various sorts of adenocarcinoma vary greatly in all their aspects, so that few useful generalizations can be made about them.","image":"Adenocarcinoma_on_pap_test_1.jpg.webp"}
