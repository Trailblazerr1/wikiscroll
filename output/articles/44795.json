{"title":"Theatre Royal, Drury Lane","summary":"The Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, commonly known as Drury Lane, is a West End theatre and Grade I listed building in Covent Garden, London, England. The building faces Catherine Street (earlier named Bridges or Brydges Street) and backs onto Drury Lane. The building is the most recent in a line of four theatres which were built at the same location, the earliest of which dated back to 1663, making it the oldest theatre site in London still in use.[1] According to the author Peter Thomson, for its first two centuries, Drury Lane could \"reasonably have claimed to be London's leading theatre\".[2] For most of that time, it was one of a handful of patent theatres, granted monopoly rights to the production of \"legitimate\" drama in London (meaning spoken plays, rather than opera, dance, concerts, or plays with music).","image":"Theatre_Royal%2C_Drury_Lane_20130408_022.jpg.webp"}
