{"title":"Prussia","summary":"Prussia[lower-alpha 1] was a historically prominent German state that originated in 1525 with a duchy centered on the region of Prussia on the southeast coast of the Baltic Sea. It was de facto dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and de jure by an Allied decree in 1947. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organized and effective army. Prussia, with its capital first in KÃ¶nigsberg and then, when it became the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, in Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany.","image":"Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Prussia_(1803-1892).svg.png.webp","url":"Prussia"}
