{"title":"Gretchen Carlson","summary":"Gretchen Elizabeth Carlson (born June 21, 1966[2]) is an American broadcast journalist, author, television personality, violinist, Miss America winner, and female empowerment advocate. Carlson appeared as the host of numerous television programs, most notably on the Saturday edition of The Early Show on CBS News from 2002 to 2005, Fox Newsâ€™ morning show Fox & Friends from 2005 to 2013 and The Real Story with Gretchen Carlson on Fox News from 2013 to 2016.  Most recently she founded a campaign, Lift Our Voices, to ban non-disclosure agreements and forced arbitration clauses in employment agreements in the American workplace so that victims of sexual harassment, pay inequity, and workplace toxicity would not be forcibly silenced by an NDA, which she and the other founders of the movement regard as a type of retaliation on victims.","image":"Photo_of_Gretchen_Carlson_in_2017.jpg.webp","url":"Gretchen_Carlson"}
