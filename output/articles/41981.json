{"title":"Standard state","summary":"In chemistry, the standard state of a material (pure substance, mixture or solution) is a reference point used to calculate its properties under different conditions. A superscript circle is used to designate a thermodynamic quantity in the standard state, such as change in enthalpy (ΔH°), change in entropy (ΔS°), or change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG°).[1][2] (See discussion about typesetting below.)","image":"60f7bc29238b21553311d8359274b4782ecb3f73.svg","url":"Standard_state"}
