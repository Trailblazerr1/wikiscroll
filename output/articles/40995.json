{"title":"Slow Train Coming","summary":"Slow Train Coming is the 19th studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 20, 1979, by Columbia Records.  Slow Train is the title song of the album.  It was Dylan's first album following his brief flirtation with Christianity, and the songs either express personal faith, or stress the importance of Christian teachings and philosophy. The evangelical nature of the record alienated many of Dylan's existing fans; at the same time, many Christians were drawn into his fan base. Slow Train Coming was listed at No.â€‰16 in the 2001 book CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music.","image":"Bob_Dylan_-_Slow_Train_Coming.jpg.webp","url":"Slow_Train_Coming"}
