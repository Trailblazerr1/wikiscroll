{"title":"Magic in Harry Potter","summary":"In J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, magic is depicted as a supernatural force that can be used to override the usual laws of nature. Many fictional magical creatures exist in the series, while ordinary creatures also sometimes exhibit magical properties. Magical objects are also described. The small number of humans who are able to perform magic (witches and wizards) refer to the rest of the population, oblivious to the existence of magic, as \"Muggles\" in the United Kingdom and \"No-Maj\" in the United States.","image":"The_Making_of_Harry_Potter_29-05-2012_(7415388714).jpg.webp","url":"Magic_in_Harry_Potter"}
