{"title":"Thesis","summary":"A thesis, or dissertation[note 1] (abbreviated diss.),[2] is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings.[3] In some contexts, the word \"thesis\" or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while \"dissertation\" is normally applied to a doctorate. This is the typical arrangement in American English. In other contexts, such as within most institutions of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, the reverse is true.[4] The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.[5]","image":"1721_PhD_Ceremony_at_Leiden_University.jpg.webp","url":"Thesis"}
