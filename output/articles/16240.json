{"title":"Firefly","summary":"The Lampyridae are a family of insects in the beetle order Coleoptera with more than 2,000 described species. They are soft-bodied beetles that are commonly called fireflies, glowworms, or lightning bugs for their conspicuous use of bioluminescence during twilight to attract mates or prey. Fireflies produce a \"cold light\", with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies. This chemically produced light from the lower abdomen may be yellow, green, or pale red, with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers.[5] Some species such as the dimly glowing \"blue ghost\" of the Eastern U.S. may seem to emit blueish-white light from a distance and in low light conditions, but their glow is bright green when observed up close.[6] Their perceived blue tint may be due to the Purkinje effect.[7]","image":"Photuris_lucicrescens.jpg.webp"}
