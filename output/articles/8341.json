The capital of the Campania region is Naples.[6] As of 2018, the region had a population of around 5,820,000 people, making it Italy's third most populous region,[7] and, with an area of 13,590 km2 (5,247 sq mi), its most densely populated region. Based on its GDP, Campania is also the most economically productive region in southern Italy and the 7th most productive in the whole country. Naples' urban area, which is in Campania, is the seventh most populous in the European Union.[8] The region is home to 10 of the 58 UNESCO sites in Italy, including Pompeii and Herculaneum, the Royal Palace of Caserta, the Amalfi Coast and the Historic Centre of Naples. In addition, Campania's Mount Vesuvius is part of the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves.[9]","image":"Flag_of_Campania.svg.png.webp"}
