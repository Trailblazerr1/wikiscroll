{"title":"Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration","summary":"The main event by far shaping the foreign policy of the United States during the presidency of George W. Bush (2001â€“2009) was the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent War On Terror. There was massive domestic and international support for destroying the attackers. With UN approval, US and NATO forces quickly invaded the attackers' base in Afghanistan and drove out them and the Taliban government that harbored them. It was the start of a 20-year quagmire that finally ended in failure with the withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan.","image":"George-W-Bush.jpeg.webp"}
