{"title":"Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659)","summary":"The Franco-Spanish War (1635–1659) was a military conflict fought by France and Spain, with other powers participating at different points. The first phase which began in 1635 and ended with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia is considered a related conflict of the Thirty Years' War. The second phase continued until 1659 when France and Spain agreed the Treaty of the Pyrenees; most historians view its results as largely inconclusive.[6][7][8]","image":"Rocroi%2C_el_último_tercio%2C_por_Augusto_Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg.webp","url":"Franco-Spanish_War_(1635–1659)"}
