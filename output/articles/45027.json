{"title":"Thou shalt not covet","summary":"\"Thou shalt not covet\" is the most common translation of one (or two, depending on the numbering tradition) of the Ten Commandments or Decalogue,[1] which are widely understood as moral imperatives by legal scholars, Jewish scholars, Catholic scholars, and Protestant scholars.[2][3][4][5] The Book of Exodus and the Book of Deuteronomy both describe the Ten Commandments as having been spoken by God,[6] inscribed on two stone tablets by the finger of God,[7] and, after Moses broke the original tablets, rewritten by God on replacements.[8]","image":"lossy-page1-144px-MCC-31231_Mozes_toont_de_wetstafelen_(1).tif.jpg.webp"}
