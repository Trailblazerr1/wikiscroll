{"title":"Botswana pula","summary":"The pula is the currency of Botswana. It has the ISO 4217 code BWP and is subdivided into 100 thebe. Pula literally means \"rain\" in Setswana, because rain is very scarce in Botswana—home to much of the Kalahari Desert—and therefore valuable and a blessing.[1][2] The word also serves as the national motto of the country.","image":"Botswana_2-pula_banknote_(1980s).png.webp","url":"Botswana_pula"}
