{"title":"Yad Vashem","summary":"Yad Vashem (Hebrew: יָד וַשֵׁם‎; literally, \"a memorial and a name\") is Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. It is dedicated to preserving the memory of the Jews who were murdered; honoring Jews who fought against their Nazi oppressors and Gentiles who selflessly aided Jews in need; and researching the phenomenon of the Holocaust in particular and genocide in general, with the aim of avoiding such events in the future.[4]","image":"Yad_Vashem_Logo.svg.png.webp"}
