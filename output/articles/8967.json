{"title":"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel","summary":"The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small breed of spaniel classed in the toy group of The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club[1] that originated in the United Kingdom. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 17th most popular pure-breed in the United States.[2]   It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolour (black/white/tan), black and tan, and ruby.[1] The breed is generally friendly, placid, and good with both children and other animals; however, they require much human interaction. Since they are family dogs, it is recommended to not leave one alone for long periods at a time. The expected lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is between nine and fourteen years.[3]","image":"CarterBIS.Tiki.13.6.09.jpg.webp","url":"Cavalier_King_Charles_Spaniel"}
