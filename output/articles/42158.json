{"title":"Stationary process","summary":"In mathematics and statistics, a stationary process (or a strict/strictly stationary process or strong/strongly stationary process) is a stochastic process whose unconditional joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time.[1] Consequently, parameters such as mean and variance also do not change over time. To get an intuition of stationarity, one can imagine a frictionless pendulum. It swings back and forth in an oscillatory motion, yet the amplitude and frequency remain constant. Although the pendulum is moving, the process is stationary as its \"statistics\" are constant (frequency and amplitude). However, if a force were to be applied to the pendulum, either the frequency or amplitude would change, thus making the process non-stationary.[2]","image":"e7d06db272f40cad57e421e3a38af88597d0709a.svg","url":"Stationary_process"}
