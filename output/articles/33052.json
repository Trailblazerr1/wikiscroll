{"title":"Opal","summary":"Opal is a hydrated amorphous form of silica (SiO2Â·nH2O); its water content may range from 3 to 21% by weight, but is usually between 6 and 10%. Because of its amorphous character, it is classed as a mineraloid, unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are classed as minerals. It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of rock, being most commonly found with limonite, sandstone, rhyolite, marl, and basalt.","image":"Opal-53714.jpg.webp","url":"Opal"}
