{"title":"Oocyte","summary":"An oocyte (UK: /ˈoʊəsaɪt/, US: /ˈoʊoʊ-/), oöcyte, ovocyte, or rarely ocyte, is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is produced in the ovary during female gametogenesis. The female germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC), which then undergoes mitosis, forming oogonia.  During oogenesis, the oogonia become primary oocytes. An oocyte is a form of genetic material that can be collected for cryoconservation.","image":"Gray5.png.webp","url":"Oocyte"}
