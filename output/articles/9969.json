{"title":"Chrysotile","summary":"Chrysotile or white asbestos is the most commonly encountered form of asbestos,[4] accounting for approximately 95% of the asbestos in the United States[5] and a similar proportion in other countries.[6] It is a soft, fibrous silicate mineral in the serpentine subgroup of phyllosilicates; as such, it is distinct from other asbestiform minerals in the amphibole group. Its idealized chemical formula is Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4.[4] The material has physical properties which make it desirable for inclusion in building materials, but poses serious health risks when dispersed into air and inhaled.","image":"Chrysotile_1.jpg.webp","url":"Chrysotile"}
