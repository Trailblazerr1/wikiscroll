{"title":"Afrikaners","summary":"Afrikaners (Afrikaans: [afriˈkɑːnərs]) are a South African ethnic group descended from predominantly Dutch settlers first arriving at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th and 18th centuries.[8] They traditionally dominated South Africa's politics and commercial agricultural sector prior to 1994.[9] Afrikaans, South Africa's third[10] most widely spoken home language, evolved as the mother tongue of Afrikaners and most Cape Coloureds.[9] It originated from the Dutch vernacular[11][12] of South Holland, incorporating words brought from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and Madagascar by slaves.[13] Afrikaners make up approximately 5.2% of the total South African population, based upon the number of white South Africans who speak Afrikaans as a first language in the South African National Census of 2011.[2]","image":"Flag_of_South_Africa.svg.png.webp"}
