{"title":"Legislation","summary":"Legislation is the process or product of enrolling, enacting, or promulgating law by a legislature, parliament, or analogous governing body.[1] Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as \"legislation\" while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare, or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a non-legislative act by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act.[2]","image":"Constitution_of_the_United_States%2C_page_1.jpg.webp","url":"Legislation"}
