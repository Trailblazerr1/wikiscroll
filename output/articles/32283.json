{"title":"Nonmetal","summary":"In chemistry, a nonmetal is a chemical element that usually gains  electrons when reacting with a metal, and which forms an acid if combined with oxygen and hydrogen. Nonmetals display more variety in color and state than do metals. About half are colored or colorless gases whereas nearly all metals are silvery-gray solids. They tend to be poor conductors of heat and electricity with no structural uses, in contrast to most metals.[4]","image":"Sulfur-sample.jpg.webp","url":"Nonmetal"}
