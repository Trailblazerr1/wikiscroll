{"title":"Chablis wine","summary":"The Chablis (pronounced [ʃabli]) region is the northernmost wine district of the Burgundy region in France. The cool climate of this region produces wines with more acidity and flavors less fruity than Chardonnay wines grown in warmer climates. These wines often have a \"flinty\" note, sometimes described as \"goût de pierre à fusil\" (\"tasting of gunflint\"), and sometimes as \"steely\". The Chablis Appellation d'origine contrôlée is required to use Chardonnay grapes solely.","image":"Chablis_and_Premier_Cru_Vaulorent.jpg.webp","url":"Chablis_wine"}
