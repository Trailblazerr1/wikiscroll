{"title":"Midway Atoll","summary":"Midway Atoll (colloquial: Midway Islands; Hawaiian: Kauihelani, lit. 'the backbone of heaven'; Pihemanu, 'the loud din of birds')[2][3] is a 2.4-square-mile (6.2 km2) atoll in the North Pacific Ocean. Midway Atoll is an insular area of the United States and is an unorganized and unincorporated territory. The largest island is Sand Island, which has housing and an airstrip. Immediately to the east of Sand Island across the narrow Brooks Channel is Eastern Island, which is uninhabited and has no facilities. Forming a rough, incomplete circle around the two main islands and creating Midway Lagoon is Spit Island, a narrow reef.[1]","image":"Midway_Atoll_aerial_photo_2008.JPG.webp"}
