{"title":"Lysozyme","summary":"Lysozyme, also known as muramidase or N-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase, is an antimicrobial enzyme produced by animals that forms part of the innate immune system. Lysozyme is a glycoside hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in peptidoglycan, which is the major component of gram-positive bacterial cell wall.[1] This hydrolysis in turn compromises the integrity of bacterial cell walls causing lysis of the bacteria.","image":"Lysozymecrystals1.png.webp"}
