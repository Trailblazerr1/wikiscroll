{"title":"The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)","summary":"The Spy Who Loved Me is the ninth novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first published by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It is the shortest and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, as well as a clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.","image":"Spy_Who_Loved_Me-Ian_Fleming.jpg.webp","url":"The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(novel)"}
