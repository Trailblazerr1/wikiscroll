{"title":"Fish processing","summary":"The term fish processing refers to the processes associated with fish and fish products between the time fish are caught or harvested, and the time the final product is delivered to the customer. Although the term refers specifically to fish, in practice it is extended to cover any aquatic organisms harvested for commercial purposes, whether caught in wild fisheries or harvested from aquaculture or fish farming.","image":"Bartolomeo_Passarotti_-_The_fish_stall.jpg.webp","url":"Fish_processing"}
