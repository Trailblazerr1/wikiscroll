{"title":"Salmon run","summary":"The salmon run is the time when salmon, which have migrated from the ocean, swim to the upper reaches of rivers where they spawn on gravel beds. After spawning, all Pacific salmon and most Atlantic salmon[1] die, and the salmon life cycle starts over again. The annual run can be a major event for grizzly bears, bald eagles and sport fishermen. Most salmon species migrate during the fall (September through November).[2]","image":"Grizzly_Bear_Fishing_Brooks_Falls_(flipped).jpg.webp"}
