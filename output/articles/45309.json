{"title":"Titration","summary":"Titration (also known as titrimetry[1] and volumetric analysis) is a common laboratory method of quantitative chemical analysis to determine the concentration of an identified analyte (a substance to be analyzed).  A reagent, termed the titrant or titrator,[2] is prepared as a standard solution of known concentration and volume. The titrant reacts with a solution of analyte (which may also be termed the titrand[3]) to determine the analyte's concentration. The volume of titrant that reacted with the analyte is termed the titration volume.","image":"Acid_and_Base_Titration.jpg.webp","url":"Titration"}
