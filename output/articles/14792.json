{"title":"Endemism","summary":"Endemism is the state of a species being native to a single defined geographic location, such as an island, state, nation, country or other defined zone; organisms that are indigenous to a place are not endemic to it if they are also found elsewhere.[1] For example, the Cape sugarbird is found exclusively in southwestern South Africa and is therefore said to be endemic to that particular part of the world.[2]","image":"Orange-breasted_Sunbird_(Nectarinia_violacea).jpg.webp","url":"Endemism"}
