{"title":"English landscape garden","summary":"The English landscape garden, also called English landscape park or simply the English garden (French: Jardin à l'anglaise, Italian: Giardino all'inglese, German: Englischer Landschaftsgarten, Portuguese: Jardim inglês, Spanish: Jardín inglés), is a style of \"landscape\" garden which emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical French formal garden which emerged in the 17th century as the principal gardening style of Europe.[1] The English garden presented an idealized view of nature. Created and pioneered by William Kent and others, the “informal” garden style originated as a revolt against the architectural garden and drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by Salvator Rosa, Claude Lorrain, and Nicolas Poussin.[2][3][4]","image":"Stowe_Park%2C_Buckinghamshire_(4664560360).jpg.webp","url":"English_landscape_garden"}
