{"title":"Merlin","summary":"Merlin (Welsh: Myrddin, Cornish: Marzhin, Breton: Merzhin) is a mythic figure prominently featured in the legend of King Arthur and best known as an enchanter or wizard.[note 1] His usual depiction, based on an amalgamation of historic and legendary figures, was introduced by the 12th-century British author Geoffrey of Monmouth. It is believed that Geoffrey combined earlier tales of Myrddin and Ambrosius, two legendary Briton prophets with no connection to Arthur, to form the composite figure called Merlinus Ambrosius (Welsh: Myrddin Emrys, Breton: Merzhin Ambroaz). Geoffrey's rendering of the character became immediately popular, especially in Wales.[2] Later writers in France and elsewhere expanded the account to produce a fuller image, creating one of the most important figures in the imagination and literature of the Middle Ages.","image":"Arthur-Pyle_The_Enchanter_Merlin.JPG.webp","url":"Merlin"}
