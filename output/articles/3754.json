{"title":"Ankle","summary":"The ankle, or the talocrural region,[1] or the jumping bone (informal) is the  area where the foot and the leg meet.[2] The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the inferior tibiofibular joint.[3][4][5] The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, \"ankle\" (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint.[1][6]","image":"Ankle_en.svg.png.webp","url":"Ankle"}
