{"title":"Miscarriage","summary":"Miscarriage, also known in medical terms as a spontaneous abortion and pregnancy loss, is the natural loss of an embryo or fetus before it is able to survive independently.[1][4] Some use the cutoff of 20 weeks of gestation, after which fetal death is known as a stillbirth.[13] The most common symptom of a miscarriage is vaginal bleeding with or without pain.[1] Sadness, anxiety, and guilt may occur afterwards.[3][14] Tissue and clot-like material may leave the uterus and pass through and out of the vagina.[15] Recurrent miscarriage may also be considered a form of infertility.[16]","image":"Anembryonic_gestation.jpg.webp","url":"Miscarriage"}
