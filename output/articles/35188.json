{"title":"Plantations of Ireland","summary":"Plantations in 16th- and 17th-century Ireland involved the confiscation of Church and Irish-held land by the Irish Crown and the later colonisation of this land with settlers from Great Britain. The Crown saw the plantations as a means of controlling, romanizing, anglicising and 'civilising' parts of Ireland. The main plantations took place from the 1550s to the 1620s, the biggest of which was the plantation of Ulster. The plantations led to the founding of many towns, demographic and economic changes, changes in land ownership and the landscape, and also to ethnic and sectarian conflict.","image":"Plantations_in_Ireland.png.webp","url":"Plantations_of_Ireland"}
