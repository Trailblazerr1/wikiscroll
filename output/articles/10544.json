{"title":"Colony (biology)","summary":"In biology, a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey.[1] It is a cluster of identical cells (clones) on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell, as in bacterial colony.[2] In contrast, solitary organisms are ones in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce.","image":"Phalacrocorax_penicillatus_(Brandt's_Cormorant)_colony%2C_Point_Lobos_-_Diliff.jpg.webp","url":"Colony_(biology)"}
