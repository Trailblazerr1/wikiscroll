{"title":"Ohm's law","summary":"Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the resistance,[1] one arrives at the usual mathematical equation that describes this relationship:[2]","image":"ccb6636ea16861f62089604333e92855888f0db2.svg","url":"Ohm's_law"}
