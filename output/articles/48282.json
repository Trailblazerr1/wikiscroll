{"title":"Western United States","summary":"The Western United States (also called the American West, the Far West, and the West) is the region comprising the westernmost states of the United States. As American settlement in the U.S. expanded westward, the meaning of the term the West changed. Before about 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier. The frontier moved westward and eventually the lands west of the Mississippi River were considered the West.[5]","image":"Map_of_the_U.S.%2C_highlighting_the_West.svg.png.webp","url":"Western_United_States"}
