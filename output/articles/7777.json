{"title":"Bryozoa","summary":"Bryozoa (also known as the Polyzoa, Ectoprocta or commonly as moss animals)[5] are a phylum of simple, aquatic invertebrate animals, nearly all living in sedentary colonies. Typically about 0.5 millimetres (1⁄64 inch) long, they have a special feeding structure called a lophophore, a \"crown\" of tentacles used for filter feeding. Most marine bryozoans live in tropical waters, but a few are found in oceanic trenches and polar waters. The bryozoans are classified as the marine bryozoans (Stenolaemata), freshwater bryozoans (Phylactolaemata), and mostly-marine bryozoans (Gymnolaemata), a few members of which prefer brackish water. 5,869 living species are known.[6] One genus is solitary; all the rest are colonial.","image":"Haeckel_Bryozoa.jpg.webp","url":"Bryozoa"}
