{"title":"Starling","summary":"Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family Sturnidae. The name \"Sturnidae\" comes from the Latin word for starling, sturnus. Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they generally compete for habitats with native birds and are considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling, and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is indeed common.","image":"Lamprotornis_hildebrandti_-Tanzania-8-2c.jpg.webp","url":"Starling"}
