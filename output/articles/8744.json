{"title":"Carriage","summary":"A carriage is a private four-wheeled vehicle for people and is most commonly horse-drawn. Second-hand private carriages were common public transport, the equivalent of modern cars used as taxis. Carriage suspensions are by leather strapping and, on those made in recent centuries, steel springs.  Two-wheeled carriages are informal and usually owner-driven.","image":"Horse_of_Buckingham_Palace%2C_Londres_cropped_straightened.jpg.webp","url":"Carriage"}
