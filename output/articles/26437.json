{"title":"List of Formula One drivers who set a fastest lap","summary":"Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform.[2] The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] Drivers are awarded points based on their position at the end of each race, and the driver who accumulates the most points over each calendar year is crowned that year's World Champion.[4] At each Grand Prix, the driver who completes the quickest lap of the circuit is said to have completed the fastest lap. The driver who set the fastest lap in a Grand Prix was awarded a point from the 1950 season to 1959. This was reintroduced in the 2019 season.[5][lower-alpha 1] As of the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 135 different drivers have set a fastest lap in a Formula One Grand Prix.[6]","image":"Schumacher_china_2012.jpg.webp"}
