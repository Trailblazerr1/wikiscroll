{"title":"Lotka–Volterra equations","summary":"The Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the predator–prey equations, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations:","image":"eba353633616971f427b13e175bfbdb1b99bcff0.svg"}
