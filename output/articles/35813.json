{"title":"Precipitation hardening","summary":"Precipitation hardening, also called age hardening or particle hardening, is a heat treatment technique used to increase the yield strength of malleable materials, including most structural alloys of aluminium, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and some steels and stainless steels. In superalloys, it is known to cause yield strength anomaly providing excellent high-temperature strength.","image":"a8ec31045a53717030ef1f32b7ee332ae8da74d2.svg"}
