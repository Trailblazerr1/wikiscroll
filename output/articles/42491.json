{"title":"Stress (biology)","summary":"Stress, either physiological, biological, or psychological is an organism's response to a stressor such as an environmental condition.[1] Stress is the body's method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. Stimuli that alter an organism's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body.[2] In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress.[3]","image":"Classes_of_stresses_that_plants_are_exposed_to.jpg.webp"}
