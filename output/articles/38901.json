{"title":"SMS Schleswig-Holstein","summary":"SMS Schleswig-Holstein[lower-alpha 1] (pronounced [ˈʃleːsvɪç ˈhɔlʃtaɪn]) was the last of the five  Deutschland-class battleships built by the German Kaiserliche Marine. The ship, named for the province of Schleswig-Holstein, was laid down in the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel in August 1905 and commissioned into the fleet nearly three years later. The ships of her class were already outdated by the time they entered service, being inferior in size, armor, firepower and speed to the new generation of dreadnought battleships.","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-63-47%2C_Linienschiff_\"Schleswig-Holstein\".jpg.webp","url":"SMS_Schleswig-Holstein"}
