{"title":"Abolitionism in the United States","summary":"Abolitionism in the United States was a movement that sought to end gradually or immediately slavery in the United States. It was active from the late colonial era until the American Civil War, which brought about the abolition of American slavery through the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The anti-slavery movement originated during the Age of Enlightenment, focused on ending the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In Colonial America, a few German Quakers issued the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery, which marks the beginning of the American abolitionist movement. Before the Revolutionary War, evangelical colonists were the primary advocates for the opposition to slavery and the slave trade, doing so on humanitarian grounds. James Oglethorpe, the founder of the colony of Georgia, originally tried to prohibit slavery upon its founding, a decision that was eventually reversed.","image":"Remember_Your_Weekly_Pledge_Massachusetts_Anti-Slavey_Society_collection_box.jpg.webp","url":"Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"}
