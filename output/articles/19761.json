{"title":"Hashish","summary":"Hashish (Arabic: حشيش‎, (IPA: [ħæʃiːʃ])), also known as hash, is a drug made by compressing and processing trichomes of the cannabis plant.[2][3] It is consumed by smoking, typically in a pipe, bong, vaporizer or joint, or via oral ingestion. Hash has a long history of usage in countries such as Israel, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Morocco, and Lebanon.[4] Hash consumption is also popular in Europe. In the United States, dried flowers or concentrates are more popular, though hash has seen a rise in popularity following changes in law.[5][6] Like many recreational drugs, multiple synonyms and alternative names for hash exist, and vary greatly depending on the country and native language.[7]","image":"Hashish.jpg.webp"}
