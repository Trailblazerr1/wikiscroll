{"title":"Philae (spacecraft)","summary":"Philae (/ˈfaɪliː/[6] or /ˈfiːleɪ/[7]) is a robotic European Space Agency lander that accompanied the Rosetta spacecraft[8][9] until it separated to land on comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, ten years and eight months after departing Earth.[10][11][12] On 12 November 2014, Philae touched down on the comet, but it bounced when its anchoring harpoons failed to deploy and a thruster designed to hold the probe to the surface did not fire.[13]  After bouncing off the surface twice, Philae achieved the first-ever \"soft\" (nondestructive) landing on a comet nucleus,[14][15][16] although the lander's final, uncontrolled touchdown left it in a non-optimal location and orientation.[17]","image":"Philae_lander_(transparent_bg).png.webp"}
