{"title":"Land of Israel","summary":"The Land of Israel (Hebrew: אֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל‎, Modern: Eretz Yisrael, Tiberian: ʼÉreṣ Yiśrāʼēl) is the traditional Jewish name for an area of indefinite geographical extension in the Southern Levant. Related biblical, religious and historical English terms include the Land of Canaan, the Promised Land, the Holy Land, and Palestine (see also Israel (disambiguation)). The definitions of the limits of this territory vary between passages in the Hebrew Bible, with specific mentions in Genesis 15, Exodus 23, Numbers 34 and Ezekiel 47. Nine times elsewhere in the Bible, the settled land is referred as \"from Dan to Beersheba\", and three times it is referred as \"from the entrance of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt\" (1 Kings 8:65, 1 Chronicles 13:5 and 2 Chronicles 7:8).","image":"Elah_Valley_below_Adullam.jpg.webp","url":"Land_of_Israel"}
