{"title":"My Prerogative","summary":"\"My Prerogative\" is a song by American singer Bobby Brown from his second studio album, Don't Be Cruel (1988). It was released on October 11, 1988, as the second single from the album. After recording sessions were completed, Brown and producer Gene Griffin traveled to New York City, since he felt something was \"missing\" from the record. \"My Prerogative\" was written by Brown as a response to the criticism he received for his departure from New Edition. He explained the song was about making decisions in one's life and not caring about other people's judgment. \"My Prerogative\" is often considered as new jack swing.[1]","image":"MyPrerogative-BBrown.jpg.webp"}
