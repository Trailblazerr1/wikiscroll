{"title":"Cultural impact of the Beatles","summary":"The English rock band the Beatles are commonly regarded as the foremost and most influential band in popular music history. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they sparked the \"Beatlemania\" phenomenon in 1963, gained international superstardom in 1964, and remained active until their break-up in 1970. Over the latter half of the decade, they were often viewed as orchestrators of society's developments. Their recognition concerns their effect on the era's youth and counterculture, British identity, popular music's evolution into an art form, and their unprecedented following.","image":"Aankomst_Beatles_op_Schiphol%2C_de_Beatles_op_de_vliegtuigtrap_met_aan_hun_voeten_%2C_Bestanddeelnr_916-5123.jpg.webp"}
