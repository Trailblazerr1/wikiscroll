{"title":"Davisson–Germer experiment","summary":"The Davisson–Germer experiment was a 1923-27 experiment by Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer at Western Electric (later Bell Labs),[1] in which electrons, scattered by the surface of a crystal of nickel metal, displayed a diffraction pattern. This confirmed the hypothesis, advanced by Louis de Broglie in 1924, of wave-particle duality, and was an experimental milestone in the creation of quantum mechanics.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Davisson–Germer_experiment"}
