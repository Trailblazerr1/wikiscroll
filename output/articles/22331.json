{"title":"Intravenous therapy","summary":"Intravenous therapy (abbreviated as IV therapy) is a medical technique that delivers fluids, medications and nutrition directly into a person's vein. The intravenous route of administration is commonly used for rehydration or to provide nutrition for those who cannot, or will not—due to reduced mental states or otherwise—consume food or water by mouth. It may also be used to administer medications or other medical therapy such as blood products or electrolytes to correct electrolyte imbalances. Attempts at providing intravenous therapy have been recorded as early as the 1400s, but the practice did not become widespread until the 1900s after the development of techniques for safe, effective use.","image":"ICU_IV_1.jpg.webp"}
