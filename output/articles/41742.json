{"title":"Spina bifida","summary":"Spina bifida (Latin for \"split spine\"; SB[9]) is a birth defect in which there is incomplete closing of the spine and the membranes around the spinal cord during early development in pregnancy.[1] There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, meningocele and myelomeningocele.[1] Meningocele and myelomeningocele may be grouped as spina bifida cystica.[10] The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases it may be in the middle back or neck.[11] Occulta has no or only mild signs, which may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot or swelling on the back at the site of the gap in the spine.[5][1] Meningocele typically causes mild problems, with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine.[1] Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form.[2] Problems associated with this form include poor ability to walk, impaired bladder or bowel control, accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), a tethered spinal cord and latex allergy.[2] Learning problems are relatively uncommon.[2]","image":"Spina-bifida.jpg.webp"}
