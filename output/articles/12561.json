{"title":"Democratic socialism","summary":"Democratic socialism is a political philosophy that supports political democracy within a socially owned economy,[1] with a particular emphasis on economic democracy, workplace democracy, and workers' self-management[2] within a market socialist economy, or an alternative form of decentralised planned socialist economy.[3] Democratic socialists argue that capitalism is inherently incompatible with the values of freedom, equality, and solidarity and that these ideals can only be achieved through the realisation of a socialist society.[4] Although most democratic socialists seek a gradual transition to socialism,[5] democratic socialism can support either revolutionary or reformist politics as means to establish socialism.[6] Democratic socialism was popularised by socialists who were opposed to the backsliding towards a one-party state in the Soviet Union and other nations during the 20th century.[7]","image":"Red_flag_waving.svg.png.webp"}
