He was also an important figure in Latin American literature. He was very politically active and is considered an important revolutionary philosopher and political theorist.[1][2] Through his writings and political activity, he became a symbol of Cuba's bid for independence from the Spanish Empire in the 19th century, and is referred to as the \"Apostle of Cuban Independence\".[3] From adolescence, he dedicated his life to the promotion of liberty, political independence for Cuba, and intellectual independence for all Spanish Americans; his death was used as a cry for Cuban independence from Spain by both the Cuban revolutionaries and those Cubans previously reluctant to start a revolt.","image":"José_Martí_retrato_más_conocido_Jamaica_1892.jpg.webp","url":"José_Martí"}
