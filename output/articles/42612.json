{"title":"Substitute (association football)","summary":"In association football, a substitute is a player who is brought on to the pitch during a match in exchange for an existing player. Substitutions are generally made to replace a player who has become tired or injured, or who is performing poorly, or for tactical reasons (such as bringing a striker on in place of a defender). Unlike some sports (such as American football, ice hockey or kabaddi), but like in baseball, a player who has been substituted during a match takes no further part in it.","image":"Argentina_substitute_bench_â€“_Portugal_vs._Argentina%2C_9th_February_2011_(1).jpg.webp","url":"Substitute_(association_football)"}
