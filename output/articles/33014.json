{"title":"Onomatopoeia","summary":"Onomatopoeia[note 1] (also onomatopeia in American English), is the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. Such a word itself is also called an onomatopoeia. Common onomatopoeias include animal noises such as oink, meow (or miaow), roar, and chirp. Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system;[6][7] hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as tick tock in English, tic tac in Spanish and Italian (shown in the picture), dī dā in Mandarin, katchin katchin in Japanese, or tik-tik in Hindi.","image":"Clocks_no_tic_tac.JPG.webp"}
