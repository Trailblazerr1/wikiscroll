{"title":"Velocity","summary":"The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time. Velocity is equivalent to a specification of an object's speed and direction of motion (e.g. 60Â km/h to the north). Velocity is a fundamental concept in kinematics, the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of bodies.","image":"US_Navy_040501-N-1336S-037_The_U.S._Navy_sponsored_Chevy_Monte_Carlo_NASCAR_leads_a_pack_into_turn_four_at_California_Speedway.jpg.webp"}
