{"title":"Medici Bank","summary":"The Medici Bank (Italian: Banco dei Medici [ˈbaŋko dei ˈmɛːditʃi]) was a financial institution created by the Medici family in Italy during the 15th century (1397–1494). It was the largest and most respected bank in Europe during its prime.[1] There are some estimates that the Medici family was, for a period of time, the wealthiest family in Europe. Estimating their wealth in today's money is difficult and imprecise, considering that they owned art, land, and gold. With this monetary wealth, the family acquired political power initially in Florence, and later in the wider spheres of Italy and Europe.","image":"Augmented_Arms_of_Medici.svg.png.webp","url":"Medici_Bank"}
