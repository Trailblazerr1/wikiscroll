{"title":"Tropicbird","summary":"Tropicbirds are a family, Phaethontidae, of tropical pelagic seabirds. They are the sole living representatives of the order Phaethontiformes. For many years they were considered part of the Pelecaniformes, but genetics indicates they are most closely related to the Eurypygiformes. There are three species in one genus, Phaethon. The scientific names are derived from Ancient Greek phaethon, \"sun\".[2] They have predominantly white plumage with elongated tail feathers and small feeble legs and feet.","image":"Red-billed_Tropicbird_(Phaethon_aethereus)_(4089464789).jpg.webp"}
