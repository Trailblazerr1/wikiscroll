{"title":"Theanine","summary":"Theanine /ˈθiːəniːn/, also known as L-γ-glutamylethylamide and N5-ethyl-L-glutamine, is an amino acid analogue of the proteinogenic amino acids L-glutamate and L-glutamine and is found primarily in particular plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of green tea in 1949; in 1950, it was isolated from gyokuro leaves.[4] Theanine provides a unique brothy or savory (umami) flavor to green tea infusions.","image":"L-Theanine.svg.png.webp","url":"Theanine"}
