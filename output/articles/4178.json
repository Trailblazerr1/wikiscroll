{"title":"Aquaculture","summary":"Aquaculture (less commonly spelled aquiculture[2]), also known as aquafarming, is the controlled cultivation (\"farming\") of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae and other organisms of value such as aquatic plants (e.g. lotus). Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled or semi-natural conditions, and can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish.[3]  Mariculture, commonly known as marine farming, refers specifically to aquaculture practiced in seawater habitats, opposed to in freshwater aquaculture.","image":"Aquaculturechile.jpg.webp"}
