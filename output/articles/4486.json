{"title":"Artery","summary":"An artery (plural  arteries) (from Greek  ἀρτηρία (artēríā) 'windpipe, artery')[1] is a blood vessel in humans, and most other animals that takes blood  away from the heart to one or more parts of the body (tissues, lungs, brain etc.). Most arteries carry oxygenated blood; the two exceptions are the pulmonary and the umbilical arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood to the organs that oxygenate it (lungs and placenta, respectively). The effective arterial blood volume is that extracellular fluid which fills the arterial system.","image":"Artery.svg.png.webp","url":"Artery"}
