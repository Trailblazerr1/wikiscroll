{"title":"Ethylenediamine","summary":"Ethylenediamine (abbreviated as en when a ligand) is the organic compound with the formula C2H4(NH2)2. This colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor is a basic amine. It is a widely used building block in chemical synthesis, with approximately 500,000 tonnes produced in 1998.[6] Ethylenediamine readily reacts with moisture in humid air to produce a corrosive, toxic and irritating mist, to which even short exposures can cause serious damage to health (see safety).  Ethylenediamine is the first member of the so-called polyethylene amines.","image":"Ethane-1%2C2-diamine_200.svg.png.webp","url":"Ethylenediamine"}
