{"title":"Rashtrakuta dynasty","summary":"Rashtrakuta (IAST: rāṣṭrakūṭa) (r. 753-982 CE) was a royal Indian dynasty ruling large parts of the Indian subcontinent between the sixth and 10th centuries. The earliest known Rashtrakuta inscription is a 7th-century copper plate grant detailing their rule from Manapura, a city in Central or West India. Other ruling Rashtrakuta clans from the same period mentioned in inscriptions were the kings of Achalapur and the rulers of Kannauj. Several controversies exist regarding the origin of these early Rashtrakutas, their native homeland and their language.","image":"Indian_Rashtrakuta_Empire_map.svg.png.webp","url":"Rashtrakuta_dynasty"}
