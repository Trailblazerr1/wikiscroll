{"title":"Virginity","summary":"Virginity is the state of a person who has never engaged in sexual intercourse.[1][2] The term virgin originally only referred to sexually inexperienced women, but has evolved to encompass a range of definitions, as found in traditional, modern and ethical concepts.[3][4][5][6] Heterosexual individuals may or may not consider loss of virginity to occur only through penile-vaginal penetration,[3][5][7][8] while people of other sexual orientations often include oral sex, anal sex, or mutual masturbation in their definitions of losing one's virginity.[3][6][9]","image":"William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_(1825-1905)_-Youth_(1893).jpg.webp"}
