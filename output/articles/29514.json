{"title":"Methadone","summary":"Methadone, sold under the brand names Dolophine and Methadose among others, is a synthetic opioid agonist used for opioid maintenance therapy in opioid dependence and for chronic pain management.[6] It is most commonly used in the treatment of addiction to heroin.[8] Detoxification using methadone can be accomplished in less than a month, or it may be done gradually over as long as six months.[6] While a single dose has a rapid effect, maximum effect can take up to five days of use.[6] The pain-relieving effects last about six hours after a single dose.[6][9] After long-term use, in people with normal liver function, effects last 8 to 36 hours.[6][7] Methadone is usually taken by mouth and rarely by injection into a muscle or vein.[6]","image":"Methadone.svg.png.webp"}
