{"title":"Here I Stand (Usher album)","summary":"Here I Stand is the fifth studio album by the American singer Usher, released on May 13, 2008, by LaFace Records. Inspired by love for his new wife—Tameka Foster—and son, Usher recorded many ballads for the album. Prior to the album's recording, Usher split with his mother, Jonnetta Patton, as manager and hired Benny Medina. Usher's estranged father died months before the release of Here I Stand; this also influenced themes of the album. It was originally to be titled \"Measure of a Man\", but Usher named it Here I Stand to mark \"a new chapter in life\".[1]","image":"Here_I_Stand_(Usher_album).jpg.webp","url":"Here_I_Stand_(Usher_album)"}
