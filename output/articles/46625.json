{"title":"Unit of measurement","summary":"A unit of measurement is a definite magnitude of a quantity, defined and adopted by convention or by law, that is used as a standard for measurement of the same kind of quantity.[1] Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement.[2] For example, a length is a physical quantity. The metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metres (or 10 m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \"metre\". Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind.[3]","image":"Weights_and_Measures_office.jpg.webp","url":"Unit_of_measurement"}
