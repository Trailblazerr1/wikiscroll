{"title":"German cruiser Admiral Hipper","summary":"Admiral Hipper, the first of five ships of her class, was the lead ship of the  Admiral Hipper class of heavy cruisers which served with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The ship was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in July 1935 and launched February 1937; Admiral Hipper entered service shortly before the outbreak of war, in April 1939. The ship was named after Admiral Franz von Hipper, commander of the German battlecruiser squadron during the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and later commander-in-chief of the German High Seas Fleet. She was armed with a main battery of eight 20.3 cm (8.0 in) guns and, although nominally under the 10,000-long-ton (10,000 t) limit set by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, actually displaced over 16,000 long tons (16,000 t).","image":"Bundesarchiv_DVM_10_Bild-23-63-24%2C_Schwerer_Kreuzer_\"Admiral_Hipper\".jpg.webp","url":"German_cruiser_Admiral_Hipper"}
