{"title":"Ethnic groups in Europe","summary":"Europeans are the focus of European ethnology, the field of anthropology related to the various indigenous groups that reside in the nations of Europe. Groups may be defined by common genetic ancestry, common language, or both. According to the German monograph Minderheitenrechte in Europa co-edited by Pan and Pfeil (2002) there are 87 distinct indigenous peoples of Europe, of which 33 form the ethnic majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. The total number of national or linguistic minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans.[1] The Russians are the most populous among Europeans, with a population over 134 million.[2]\nThere are no universally accepted and precise definitions of the terms \"ethnic group\" and \"nationality\". In the context of European ethnography in particular, the terms ethnic group, people, nationality and ethno-linguistic group, are used as mostly synonymous, although preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual countries of Europe.[3]","image":"Simplified_Languages_of_Europe_map.svg.png.webp"}
