{"title":"Sempron","summary":"Sempron has been the marketing name used by AMD for several different budget desktop CPUs, using several different technologies and CPU socket formats. The Sempron replaced the AMD Duron processor and competed against Intel's Celeron series of processors. AMD coined the name from the Latin semper, which means \"always\", to suggest the Sempron is suitable for \"daily use, practical, and part of everyday life\".[2] The last Semprons were launched in April 2014. The brand was retired with the launch of the AMD A-Series APUs.","image":"Sempron_logo.png.webp"}
