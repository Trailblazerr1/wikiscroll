{"title":"Linear trend estimation","summary":"Linear trend estimation is a statistical technique to aid interpretation of data. When a series of measurements of a process are treated as, for example, a sequences or time series, trend estimation can be used to make and justify statements about tendencies in the data, by relating the measurements to the times at which they occurred. This model can then be used to describe the behaviour of the observed data, without explaining it. In this case linear trend estimation expresses data as a linear function of time, and can also be used to determine the significance of differences in a set of data linked by a categorical factor. An example of the latter from biomedical science would be levels of a molecule in the blood or tissues of patients with incrementally worsening disease â€“ such as mild, moderate and severe.[1] This is in contrast to an ANOVA, which is reserved for three or more independent groups (e.g. heart disease, cancer, arthritis) (see below).","image":"65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560.svg"}
