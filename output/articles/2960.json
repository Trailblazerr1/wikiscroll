{"title":"All Hope Is Gone","summary":"All Hope Is Gone is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Slipknot, released on August 20, 2008 by Roadrunner Records. The album was published in two versions: the standard album in a CD case and a special edition packaged in a six-fold digipak containing three bonus tracks, a 40Â page booklet, and a bonus DVD with a documentary of the album's recording. Preparation for the album began in 2007, while recording started in February 2008 in the band's home state of Iowa. Before the album's launch, Slipknot released a series of promotional images and audio samples from the album through various websites. All Hope Is Gone was considered the band's most eclectic-sounding album at the time of release, incorporating elements from their previous three. The album shows Slipknot completely abandoning the nu metal genre, moving to a groove metal style. Songs such as the opening track \"Gematria (The Killing Name)\" and the title track espouse the band's more brutal, death metal-influenced edge, reminiscent of songs such as \"(sic)\" from their debut self-titled album; slow burning, \"trippy\" elements such as \"Gehenna\", recalling \"Skin Ticket\" from their second album Iowa; and more tragic, sentimental tracks such as \"Dead Memories\" and \"Snuff\".","image":"All_Hope_is_Gone_(original).jpg.webp","url":"All_Hope_Is_Gone"}
