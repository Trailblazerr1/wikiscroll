{"title":"Algorithm","summary":"In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm (/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ (listen)) is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.[1] Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, automated decision-making and other tasks. In contrast, a heuristic is an approach to problem solving that may not be fully specified or may not guarantee correct or optimal results, especially in problem domains where there is no well-defined correct or optimal result.[2]","image":"Euclid_flowchart.svg.png.webp","url":"Algorithm"}
