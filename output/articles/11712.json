{"title":"Curate","summary":"A curate (/ˈkjʊərɪt/, sometimes /ˈkjʊərət/) is a person who is invested with the care or cure (cura) of souls of a parish. In this sense, \"curate\" correctly means a parish priest; but in English-speaking countries the term curate is commonly used to describe clergy who are assistants to the parish priest. The duties or office of a curate are called a curacy.","image":"Johnvianney.jpg.webp"}
