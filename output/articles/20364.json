{"title":"Hip dysplasia","summary":"Hip dysplasia is an abnormality of the hip joint where the socket portion does not fully cover the ball portion, resulting in an increased risk for joint dislocation.[1] Hip dysplasia may occur at birth or develop in early life.[1] Regardless, it does not typically produce symptoms in babies less than a year old.[3] Occasionally one leg may be shorter than the other.[1] The left hip is more often affected than the right.[3] Complications without treatment can include arthritis, limping, and low back pain.[3]","image":"Congenitaldislocation10.JPG.webp"}
