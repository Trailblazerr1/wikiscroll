{"title":"Demonym","summary":"A demonym (/ˈdɛmənɪm/; from Ancient Greek δῆμος, dêmos, \"people, tribe\" and ὄνυμα, ónuma, \"name\") or gentilic (from Latin gentilis, \"of a clan, or gens\")[1] is a word that identifies a group of people (inhabitants, residents, natives) in relation to a particular place.[2] Demonyms are usually derived from the name of the place (hamlet, village, town, city, region, province, state, country, continent, planet, and beyond).[3] Demonyms are used to designate all people (the general population) of a particular place, regardless of ethnic, linguistic, religious or other cultural differences that may exist within the population of that place. Examples of demonyms include Cochabambino, for someone from the city of Cochabamba; American for a person from the United States of America; and Swahili, for a person of the Swahili coast.","image":"Symbol_portal_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Demonym"}
