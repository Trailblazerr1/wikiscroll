{"title":"Apostasy","summary":"Apostasy (/əˈpɒstəsi/; Greek: ἀποστασία apostasía, \"a defection or revolt\") is the formal disaffiliation from, abandonment of, or renunciation of a religion by a person. It can also be defined within the broader context of embracing an opinion that is contrary to one's previous religious beliefs.[1] One who undertakes apostasy is known as an apostate. Undertaking apostasy is called apostatizing (or apostasizing – also spelled apostacizing). The term apostasy is used by sociologists to mean the renunciation and criticism of, or opposition to, a person's former religion, in a technical sense, with no pejorative connotation.","image":"Apostasy_laws_world_map.svg.png.webp","url":"Apostasy"}
