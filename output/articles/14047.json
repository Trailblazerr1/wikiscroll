{"title":"Eastern brown snake","summary":"The eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis), often referred to as the common brown snake, is a species of highly venomous snake in the family Elapidae. The species is native to eastern and central Australia and southern New Guinea. It was first described by André Marie Constant Duméril, Gabriel Bibron, and Auguste Duméril in 1854. The adult eastern brown snake has a slender build and can grow to 2 m (7 ft) in length. The colour of its surface ranges from pale brown to black, while its underside is pale cream-yellow, often with orange or grey splotches. The eastern brown snake is found in most habitats except dense forests. They are found often in farmland and on the outskirts of urban areas, as such places are populated by their main prey, the house mouse. The species is oviparous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the snake as a least-concern species, though its status in New Guinea is unclear.","image":"Eastern_Brown_Snake_-_Kempsey_NSW.jpg.webp","url":"Eastern_brown_snake"}
