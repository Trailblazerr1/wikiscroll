{"title":"You and I (Lady Gaga song)","summary":"\"You and I\"  (stylized as \"Yo√º and I\") is a song written and recorded by American singer-songwriter Lady Gaga, taken from her second studio album, Born This Way (2011). She also co-produced it with Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange. The track samples Queen's \"We Will Rock You\" (1977) and features electric guitar by Queen's Brian May. Gaga debuted \"You and I\" in June 2010 during her performance at Elton John's White Tie and Tiara Ball. Footage of the performance appeared on the Internet, and positive response encouraged her to include the song on her setlist for The Monster Ball Tour. She later performed the song on Today  to a record crowd in July 2010, and on The Oprah Winfrey Show in May 2011. On August 23, 2011, Interscope Records released the song as the fourth single from the album.","image":"Lady_Gaga_-_You_and_I_(single).png.webp"}
