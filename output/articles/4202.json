{"title":"Arab Peace Initiative","summary":"The Arab Peace Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السلام العربية‎; Hebrew: יוזמת השלום הערבית‎), also known as the Saudi Initiative (Arabic: مبادرة السعودية‎; Hebrew: היוזמה הסעודית‎), is a 10 sentence proposal for an end to the Arab–Israeli conflict that was endorsed by the Arab League in 2002 at the Beirut Summit and re-endorsed at the 2007 and at the 2017 Arab League summits.[1] The initiative offers normalisation of relations by the Arab world with Israel, in return for a full withdrawal by Israel from the occupied territories (including the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan Heights, and Lebanon), a \"just settlement\" of the Palestinian refugee problem based on UN Resolution 194, and the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.[2] The Initiative was initially overshadowed by the Passover massacre, a major Palestinian attack that took place on 27 March 2002, the day before the Initiative was published.[3]","image":"Israel-Palestine_peace.svg.png.webp","url":"Arab_Peace_Initiative"}
