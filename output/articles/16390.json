{"title":"Flag of Ohio","summary":"The Ohio Burgee is the official flag of the U.S. state of Ohio. It is a triangular swallowtail flag, the only non-rectangular U.S. state flag. Its red, white, and blue elements symbolize the state's natural features and order of admission into the Union. A prominent disc in the flag's triangular canton is suggestive of the state's name.","image":"Flag_of_Ohio.svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_Ohio"}
