{"title":"Horse colic","summary":"Colic in horses is defined as abdominal pain,[1] but it is a clinical symptom rather than a diagnosis. The term colic can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract. The most common forms of colic are gastrointestinal in nature and are most often related to colonic disturbance. There are a variety of different causes of colic, some of which can prove fatal without surgical intervention. Colic surgery is usually an expensive procedure as it is major abdominal surgery, often with intensive aftercare. Among domesticated horses, colic is the leading cause of premature death.[2] The incidence of colic in the general horse population has been estimated between 4[2] and 10[3] percent over the course of the average lifespan. Clinical signs of colic generally require treatment by a veterinarian.  The conditions that cause colic can become life-threatening in a short period of time.[4]","image":"Equine_Ultrasound_UFL_2006-09.jpg.webp"}
