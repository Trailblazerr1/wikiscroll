{"title":"Bogeyman","summary":"The Bogeyman (/ˈbəʊɡimæn, ˈboʊɡi-/;[1] also spelled boogeyman, bogyman, bogieman, boogie monster, boogie man, or boogie woogie) is a type of mythic creature used by adults to frighten children into good behavior. Bogeymen have no specific appearance and conceptions vary drastically by household and culture, but they are most commonly depicted as masculine or androgynous monsters that punish children for misbehavior.[2] The Bogeyman or conceptually similar monsters can be found in many cultures around the world. Bogeymen may target a specific act or general misbehaviour, depending on what purpose needs serving, often based on a warning from the child's authority figure. The term \"Bogeyman\" is sometimes used as a non-specific personification or metonym for terror, and in some cases, the Devil.[3]","image":"Francisco_de_Goya%2C_Que_viene_el_coco_(Here_Comes_the_Bogey-Man)%2C_published_1799%2C_NGA_7459.jpg.webp","url":"Bogeyman"}
