{"title":"Evolution of cetaceans","summary":"The evolution of cetaceans is thought to have begun in the Indian subcontinent from even-toed ungulates 50 million years ago and to have proceeded over a period of at least 15 million years. Cetaceans are fully aquatic marine mammals belonging to the order Artiodactyla and branched off from other artiodactyls around 50Â mya (million years ago). Cetaceans are thought to have evolved during the Eocene or earlier and to share a relatively recent closest common ancestor with hippopotamuses. Being mammals, they surface to breathe air; they have 5 finger bones (even-toed) in their fins; they nurse their young; and, despite their fully aquatic life style, they retain many skeletal features from their terrestrial ancestors. Research conducted in the late 1970s in Pakistan revealed several stages in the transition of cetaceans from land to sea.","image":"Cetaceans.svg.png.webp","url":"Evolution_of_cetaceans"}
