He served as administrator of the Navy of England and Member of Parliament and is most famous for the diary he kept for a decade while still a young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, diligence, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy.[2]","image":"Samuel_Pepys.jpg.webp","url":"Samuel_Pepys"}
