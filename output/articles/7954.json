{"title":"Bus","summary":"A bus (contracted from omnibus,[1] with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.) is a public transport road vehicle designed to carry significantly more passengers than the average cars or vans. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers,[2] although the average bus usually carries between 30 to 100. The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads for double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads for midibuses and minibuses, while coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence.","image":"LT_471_(LTZ_1471)_Arriva_London_New_Routemaster_(19522859218).jpg.webp"}
