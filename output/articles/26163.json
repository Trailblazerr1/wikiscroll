{"title":"Like a Rolling Stone","summary":"\"Like a Rolling Stone\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on July 20, 1965 by Columbia Records. Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \"Like a Rolling Stone\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album Highway 61 Revisited.","image":"Bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-1965-15-s.jpg.webp"}
