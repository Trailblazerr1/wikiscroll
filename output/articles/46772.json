The team was formerly organised by the United States of America Cricket Association (USACA), which became an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1965.[6] In June 2017, the USACA was expelled by the ICC due to governance and financing issues, with the U.S. team being temporarily overseen by ICC Americas until a new sanctioning body was established.[7] In January 2019, associate membership was officially granted to USA Cricket.[8]","image":"USA_Cricket_logo.svg.png.webp"}
