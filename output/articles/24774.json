{"title":"Kim Jong-nam","summary":"Kim Jong-nam (Korean: 김정남; Hanja: 金正男, Korean: [kim.dzʌŋ.nam];[lower-alpha 1] 10 May 1971 – 13 February 2017) was the eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. From roughly 1994 to 2001, he was considered the heir apparent to his father.[1] He was thought to have fallen out of favour after embarrassing the regime in 2001 with a failed attempt to visit Tokyo Disneyland with a false passport, although Kim Jong-nam himself said his loss of favour had been due to advocating reform.","image":"Kim_Jong-nam.jpg.webp","url":"Kim_Jong-nam"}
