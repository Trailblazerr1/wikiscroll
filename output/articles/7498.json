{"title":"Breakout (Miley Cyrus album)","summary":"Breakout is the second studio album by American recording artist Miley Cyrus, released on July 22, 2008, by Hollywood Records. Despite being her second album, it is her first record that is not affiliated with the television series Hannah Montana, as Meet Miley Cyrus was released as part of a joint album with her character.  The majority of the record was composed as she traveled during her headlining Best of Both Worlds Tour (2007â€“08). Overall, Breakout is dominant on pop rock but explores a variety of other musical genres. Lyrical themes addressed in the album relate to breakups and coming of age. Most of the album was produced by Rock Mafia. Matthew Wiler and Scott Cutler also produced. Cyrus co-wrote 8 out of 13 tracks.","image":"Miley_Cyrus_-_Breakout.png.webp"}
