{"title":"Jeff Buckley","summary":"Jeffrey Scott Buckley (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as Scott Moorhead,[1] was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as Sin-é, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels[2] and Herb Cohen, the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley,[3] he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994.","image":"Jeff_Buckley.jpg.webp"}
