{"title":"List of archbishops of Canterbury","summary":"The Archbishop of Canterbury is the \"Primate of All England\" (the \"first bishop\" of England),[1] effectively serving as the head of the established Church of England and, symbolically, of the worldwide Anglican Communion. From the 6th century to the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the Bishops of Rome, the Popes.[2] Eighteen Archbishops have been canonised by the Roman Catholic Church. During the English Reformation the English church broke away from the authority of the Pope, at first temporarily, later permanently,[2] recognising only the English monarch as a source of superior temporal authority.","image":"Liste_archevÃªques_Canterbury.jpg.webp"}
