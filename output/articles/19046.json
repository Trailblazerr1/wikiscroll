{"title":"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals","summary":"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785; German: Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten; also known as the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, Grounding of the Metaphysics of Morals, and the Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals) is the first of Immanuel Kant's mature works on moral philosophy and remains one of the most influential in the field. Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethicsâ€”one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory, and showing that they are normative for rational agents.","image":"Kant_Groundwork_Title.jpg.webp"}
