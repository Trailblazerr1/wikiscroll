{"title":"Kyphosis","summary":"Kyphosis is an abnormally excessive convex curvature of the spine as it occurs in the thoracic and sacral regions.[1][2] Abnormal inward concave lordotic curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis. It can result from degenerative disc disease; developmental abnormalities, most commonly Scheuermann's disease; osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra; multiple myeloma; or trauma. A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st thoracic to the 12th thoracic vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle, ranging from 20° to 45°. When the \"roundness\" of the upper spine increases past 45° it is called kyphosis or \"hyperkyphosis\". Scheuermann's kyphosis is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence. The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females.[3]","image":"Scheuermanns_diseasebl.jpg.webp","url":"Kyphosis"}
