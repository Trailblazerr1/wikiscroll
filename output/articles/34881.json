{"title":"Phototroph","summary":"Phototrophs (Gr: φῶς, φωτός = light, τροϕή = nourishment) are organisms that carry out photon capture to produce complex organic compounds (such as carbohydrates) and acquire energy.  They use the energy from light to carry out various cellular metabolic processes.  It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily photosynthetic.  Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they anabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later catabolic processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats).  All phototrophs either use electron transport chains or direct proton pumping to establish an electrochemical gradient which is utilized by ATP synthase, to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. Phototrophs can be either autotrophs or heterotrophs. If their electron and hydrogen donors are inorganic compounds (e.g. Na2S2O3, as in some purple sulfur bacteria, or H2S, as in some green sulfur bacteria) they can be also called lithotrophs, and so, some photoautotrophs are also called photolithoautotrophs. Examples of phototroph organisms are:  Rhodobacter capsulatus, Chromatium, Chlorobium etc.","image":"Dead_tree_river.jpg.webp","url":"Phototroph"}
