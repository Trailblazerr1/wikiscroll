{"title":"Gene Ontology","summary":"The Gene Ontology (GO) is a major bioinformatics initiative to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.[1] More specifically, the project aims to: 1) maintain and develop its controlled vocabulary of gene and gene product attributes; 2) annotate genes and gene products, and assimilate and disseminate annotation data; and 3) provide tools for easy access to all aspects of the data provided by the project, and to enable functional interpretation of experimental data using the GO, for example via enrichment analysis.[2][3] GO is part of a larger classification effort, the Open Biomedical Ontologies, being one of the Initial Candidate Members of the OBO Foundry.[4]","image":"Database.png.webp","url":"Gene_Ontology"}
