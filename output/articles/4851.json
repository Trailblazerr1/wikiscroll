{"title":"Atopic dermatitis","summary":"Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a long-term type of inflammation of the skin (dermatitis).[2] It results in itchy, red, swollen, and cracked skin.[2] Clear fluid may come from the affected areas, which often thickens over time.[2] While the condition may occur at any age, it typically starts in childhood, with changing severity over the years.[2][3] In children under one year of age, much of the body may be affected.[3] As children get older, the areas on the insides of the knees and elbows are most commonly affected.[3] In adults, the hands and feet are most commonly affected.[3] Scratching the affected areas worsens the symptoms, and those affected have an increased risk of skin infections.[2] Many people with atopic dermatitis develop hay fever or asthma.[2]","image":"Atopy2010.JPG.webp","url":"Atopic_dermatitis"}
