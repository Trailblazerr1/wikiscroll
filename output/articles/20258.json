{"title":"Hibernian F.C.","summary":"Hibernian Football Club (/hɪˈbɜːrniən/), commonly known as Hibs, is a professional football club based in the Leith area of Edinburgh, Scotland. The club plays in the Scottish Premiership, the top tier of the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). The club was founded in 1875 by members of Edinburgh's Irish community, and named after the Roman word for Ireland.[4] Nowadays, while the Irish heritage of Hibernian is still reflected in the name, colours and badge,[4] support for the club is now based more on geography than ethnicity or religion.[5][6][7][8] Their local rivals are Heart of Midlothian, with whom they contest the Edinburgh derby.","image":"Hibernian_FC_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Hibernian_F.C."}
