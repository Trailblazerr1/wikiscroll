{"title":"Golden Age of Science Fiction","summary":"The first Golden Age of Science Fiction, often recognized in the United States as the period from 1938 to 1946,[1] was an era during which the science fiction genre gained wide public attention and many classic science fiction stories were published.  In the history of science fiction, the Golden Age follows the \"pulp era\" of the 1920s and 1930s, and precedes New Wave science fiction of the 1960s and 1970s. The 1950s are a transitional period in this scheme; however, Robert Silverberg, who came of age in the 1950s, saw that decade as the true Golden Age.[2]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Golden_Age_of_Science_Fiction"}
