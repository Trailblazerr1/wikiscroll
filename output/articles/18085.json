{"title":"Gilbert Stuart","summary":"Gilbert Charles Stuart (born Stewart; December 3, 1755 â€“ July 9, 1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island Colony who is widely considered one of America's foremost portraitists.[2] His best-known work is an unfinished portrait of George Washington, begun in 1796, which is sometimes referred to as the Athenaeum Portrait. Stuart retained the portrait and used it to paint scores of copies that were commissioned by patrons in America and abroad. The image of George Washington featured in the painting has appeared on the United States one-dollar bill for more than a century[2] and on various postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.[3]","image":"Gilbert_Stuart_crop.jpg.webp"}
