{"title":"Aerogel","summary":"Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas without significant collapse of the gel structure.[4] The result is a solid with extremely low density[5] and extremely low thermal conductivity. Nicknames include frozen smoke,[6] solid smoke, solid air, solid cloud, and blue smoke, owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material. Silica aerogels feel like fragile expanded polystyrene to the touch, while some polymer-based aerogels feel like rigid foams. Aerogels can be made from a variety of chemical compounds.[7]","image":"Aerogel_hand.jpg.webp","url":"Aerogel"}
