{"title":"Second Boer War","summary":"The Second Boer War (Afrikaans: Tweede Vryheidsoorlog, lit. \"Second Freedom War\", 11 October 1899 – 31 May 1902), also known as the Boer War, the Anglo-Boer War, or the South African War, was a conflict fought between the British Empire and the two Boer Republics (the South African Republic and the Orange Free State) over the Empire's influence in Southern Africa from 1899 to 1902. Triggered by the discovery of diamond and gold deposits in the Boer republics, the Boers launched successful attacks against British outposts in the opening stages of the war before being pushed back by imperial reinforcements. Though the British swiftly occupied the Boer republics, numerous Boers refused to accept defeat and engaged in guerrilla warfare. Eventually, British scorched earth policies brought the remaining Boer guerillas to the negotiating table, ending the war.[9][10]","image":"Boers_at_Spion_Kop%2C_1900_-_Project_Gutenberg_eText_16462.jpg.webp","url":"Second_Boer_War"}
