{"title":"Stratus cloud","summary":"Stratus clouds are low-level clouds characterized by horizontal layering with a uniform base, as opposed to convective or cumuliform clouds that are formed by rising thermals. More specifically, the term stratus is used to describe flat, hazy, featureless clouds at low altitudes varying in color from dark gray to nearly white.[2] The word stratus comes from the Latin prefix strato-, meaning \"layer\".[3] Stratus clouds may produce a light drizzle or a small amount of snow. These clouds are essentially above-ground fog formed either through the lifting of morning fog or through cold air moving at low altitudes over a region. Some call these clouds \"high fog\" for their fog-like form. While light rain may fall, this cloud does not indicate much meteorological precipitation.","image":"Stratus-Opacus-Uniformis.jpg.webp","url":"Stratus_cloud"}
