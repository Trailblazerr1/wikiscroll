{"title":"Whippet","summary":"The Whippet (also English Whippet or Snaphound) is a dog breed of medium size. They are a sighthound breed that originated in England, where they descended from Greyhounds. Whippets today still strongly resemble a smaller Greyhound. Part of the Hound group, Whippets have relatively few health problems other than arrhythmia. Whippets also participate in dog sports such as lure coursing, agility, dock diving and flyball. The name is derived from an early-17th-century word, now obsolete, meaning \"to move briskly\".[4]","image":"WhippetWhiteSaddled_wb.jpg.webp","url":"Whippet"}
