{"title":"Dracunculiasis","summary":"Dracunculiasis, also called Guinea-worm disease, is a parasitic infection by the Guinea worm, Dracunculus medinensis. A person becomes infected from drinking water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae. After ingestion, the worms penetrate the digestive tract and escape into the body, where they develop over the course of a year. Eventually, the adult worm migrates to an exit site – usually a lower limb – and induces an intensely painful blister on the skin. When an infected person submerges the wound in water to ease the pain, the blister bursts open and the worm spews her larvae into the water, then slowly crawls out of the wound over the course of a few weeks. The wound remains painful over the course of the worm's emergence, disabling the infected person for the three to ten weeks it takes the worm to emerge. During this time, the open wound can become infected with bacteria, leading to death in around 1% of cases.[2]","image":"Dracunculus_medinensis.jpg.webp"}
