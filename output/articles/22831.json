{"title":"Jadwiga of Poland","summary":"Jadwiga (Polish: [jadˈvʲiɡa] (listen); 1373 or 1374 – 17 July 1399), also known as Hedwig (Hungarian: Hedvig), was the first female monarch of the Kingdom of Poland, reigning from 16 October 1384 until her death. She was the youngest daughter of Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland, and his wife Elizabeth of Bosnia. Jadwiga was a member of the Capetian House of Anjou, but she had more close forebears among the Polish Piasts than among the Angevins.  In 1997 she was canonized by the Catholic Church.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
