{"title":"Wedding dress","summary":"A wedding dress or bridal gown is the dress worn by the bride during a wedding ceremony. The color, style and ceremonial importance of the gown can depend on the religion and culture of the wedding participants. Weddings are often religious events. Therefore, the influence of religion is significant. The \"white wedding\" in Europe and the United States, which has become mainstream worldwide, is deeply related to Christianity values. The white dress has become as much a symbol of a Christian wedding as wedding bands and diamond engagement rings, if not more.[1]","image":"Wedding_of_Queen_Victoria_and_Prince_Albert.jpg.webp"}
