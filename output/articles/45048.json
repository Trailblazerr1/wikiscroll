The Three Gorges Dam has been the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW) since 2012.[5][6] The dam generates an average 95±20 TWh of electricity per year, depending on annual amount of precipitation in the river basin.[7] After the extensive monsoon rainfalls of 2020, the dam's annual production nearly reached 112 TWh, breaking the previous world record of ~103 TWh set by Itaipu Dam in 2016.[8][9]","image":"ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg.webp","url":"Three_Gorges_Dam"}
