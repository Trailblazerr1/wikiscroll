{"title":"Sac spider","summary":"The sac spiders of the family Clubionidae[1] have a very confusing taxonomic history. Once, this family was a large catch-all taxon for a disparate collection of spiders, similar only in that they had eight eyes arranged in two rows[2] and conical anterior spinnerets that touched, and were wandering predators that built silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark, or under rocks. These are now recognized to include several families, some of which are more closely related to the three-clawed spiders, like lynx and wolf spiders, than to Clubionidae and related families.[3]","image":"Clubiona_trivialis2.jpg.webp","url":"Sac_spider"}
