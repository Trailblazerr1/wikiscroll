{"title":"Desert climate","summary":"The desert climate or arid climate (in the KÃ¶ppen climate classification BWh and BWk), is a climate in which there is an excess of evaporation over precipitation. The typically bald, rocky, or sandy surfaces in desert climates hold little moisture and evaporate the little rainfall they receive. Covering 14.2% of earth's land area, hot deserts are the second most common type of climate on earth[1] after polar climate.","image":"BW_climate.png.webp","url":"Desert_climate"}
