{"title":"Ballad","summary":"A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French chanson ballad√©e or ballade, which were originally \"dance songs\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of Britain and Ireland from the Late Middle  Ages until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in Australia, North Africa, North America and South America. Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated, in alternating eight and six syllable lines.","image":"Maria_Wiik_-_Ballad.jpg.webp"}
