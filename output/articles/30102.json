{"title":"Mirror neuron","summary":"A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another.[1][2][3] Thus, the neuron \"mirrors\" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in human[4] and primate species,[5] and birds.[6]","image":"Makak_neonatal_imitation.png.webp","url":"Mirror_neuron"}
