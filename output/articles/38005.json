{"title":"Rings of Power","summary":"The Rings of Power (also known as the Great Rings)[T 1] are fictional magical artefacts in J. R. R. Tolkien's writings about Middle-earth, especially his high fantasy book The Lord of the Rings. The Ruling Ring first appeared as a plot device, a magic ring in his children's book, The Hobbit; Tolkien later gave it a backstory and much greater power, as well as 19 other Rings that it could control, including the Three Rings of the Elves, Seven Rings for the Dwarves, and Nine for Men. A key story-element in The Lord of the Rings is the addictive power of the One Ring, made secretly by the Dark Lord Sauron, while the Nine Rings enslave their bearers as Ringwraiths, Sauron's most deadly servants.","image":"Rings_of_Power.svg.png.webp","url":"Rings_of_Power"}
