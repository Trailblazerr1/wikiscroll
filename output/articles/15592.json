{"title":"Ezra","summary":"Ezra (/ˈɛzrə/; Hebrew: עֶזְרָא‎, ʿEzrāʾ;[1] fl. 480–440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe (עֶזְרָא הַסּוֹפֵר‎, ʿEzrāʾ hasSōfēr) and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe (sofer) and priest (kohen). In Greco-Latin Ezra is called Esdras (Greek: Ἔσδρας). According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Sraya,[2] the last High Priest to serve in the First Temple,[3] and a close relative of Joshua, the first High Priest of the Second Temple.[4] He returned from Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem.[5] According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a High Priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was an ordinary member of the priesthood.[6]","image":"109.Ezra_Reads_the_Law_to_the_People.jpg.webp","url":"Ezra"}
