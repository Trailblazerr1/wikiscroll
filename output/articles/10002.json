{"title":"Chylothorax","summary":"A chylothorax is an abnormal accumulation of chyle, a type of lipid-rich lymph, in the space surrounding the lung.  The lymphatics of the digestive system normally returns lipids absorbed from the small bowel via the thoracic duct, which ascends behind the esophagus to drain into the left brachiocephalic vein.  If normal thoracic duct drainage is disrupted, either due to obstruction or rupture, chyle can leak and accumulate within the negative-pressured pleural space.  In people on a normal diet, this fluid collection can sometimes be identified by its turbid, milky white appearance, since chyle contains emulsified triglycerides.","image":"Chylothorax.jpg.webp"}
