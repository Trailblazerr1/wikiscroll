{"title":"Grantha script","summary":"The Grantha script (Tamil: கிரந்த எழுத்து, romanized: Granta eḻuttu; Malayalam: ഗ്രന്ഥലിപി, romanized: granthalipi) is a South Indian script, found particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Originating from the Pallava script, the Grantha script is related to the Tamil and the Vatteluttu scripts.[5] The modern Malayalam script of Kerala is a direct descendant of the Grantha script.[5] The Southeast Asian and Indonesian scripts such as Thai and Javanese respectively, as well as South Asian Tigalari and Sinhala scripts are derived or closely related to the Grantha through the early Pallava script.[6][7][8] The Pallava script or Pallava Grantha, emerged in the 4th century CE and was used until the 7th century CE, in India.[9][2] This early Grantha script was used to write Sanskrit texts, inscriptions on copper plates and stones of Hindu temples and monasteries.[10][5] It was also used for classical Manipravalam – a language that is a blend of Sanskrit and Tamil.[11] From it evolved Middle Grantha by the 7th century, and Transitional Grantha by about the 8th century, which remained in use until about the 14th century. Modern Grantha has been in use since the 14th century and into the modern era, to write classical texts in Sanskrit and Dravidian languages.[10][5] It is also used to chant hymns and in traditional Vedic schools.[12]","image":"Mandakapattu_Inscription.jpg.webp"}
