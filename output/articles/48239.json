{"title":"West Indian manatee","summary":"The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) or \"sea cow\", also known as North American manatee, is the largest surviving member of the aquatic mammal order Sirenia (which also includes the dugong and the extinct Steller's sea cow).[8][9][10][11][12]  It is further divided into two subspecies, the Florida manatee (T. m. latirostris) and the Antillean or Caribbean manatee (T. m. manatus), based on genetic and morphological studies.[13][14] The Florida subspecies is primarily found along the coasts of Florida, but its range extends as far west as Texas and as far north as Massachusetts.[15] The Antillean subspecies has a sparse distribution throughout the Caribbean, ranging as far north as Mexico and as far south as Brazil.[16][17]","image":"Manatee_with_calf.PD_-_colour_corrected.jpg.webp","url":"West_Indian_manatee"}
