{"title":"Mac Mini","summary":"The Mac Mini (stylized as Mac mini) is a small form-factor desktop computer developed and marketed by Apple Inc. As of 2021, it is positioned between the consumer all-in-one iMac and the professional Mac Pro as one of three current Macintosh desktop computers. It is the company's only consumer desktop computer since 2005 to ship without a display, a keyboard, and a mouse. The machine was initially branded as \"BYODKM\" (Bring Your Own Display, Keyboard, and Mouse) as a strategic pitch to encourage users to switch from PCs running operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Linux.","image":"Mac-mini-2018-logo.png.webp","url":"Mac_Mini"}
