{"title":"Trigeminal neuralgia","summary":"Trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN) is a long-term pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve,[1] the nerve responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. It is a form of neuropathic pain.[7] There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia.[1] The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes.[1] Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours.[1] The atypical form results in a constant burning pain that is less severe.[1] Episodes may be triggered by any touch to the face.[1] Both forms may occur in the same person.[1] It is regarded to be one of the most painful disorders known to medicine, and often results in depression.[5]","image":"Gray778.png.webp"}
