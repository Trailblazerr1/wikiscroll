{"title":"Dopamine agonist","summary":"A dopamine agonist (DA) is a compound that activates dopamine receptors. There are two families of dopamine receptors, D2-like and D1-like, and they are all G protein-coupled receptors. D1- and D5-receptors belong to the D1-like family and the D2-like family includes D2, D3 and D4 receptors.[1] Dopamine agonists are used in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and, to a lesser extent, to treat depression, hyperprolactinemia and restless legs syndrome.[2]","image":"Dopamine.svg.png.webp","url":"Dopamine_agonist"}
