{"title":"Tajik language","summary":"Tajik (Tajik: забо́ни тоҷикӣ́, zaboni tojikī, [zaˈbɔni tɔdʒiˈki]),[2] also called Tajiki Persian (Tajik: форси́и тоҷикӣ́, forsii tojikī, [fɔrˈsiji tɔdʒiˈki]), Tajiki, and Tadzhiki, is the variety of Persian spoken in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by Tajik people. It is closely related to neighbouring Dari with which it forms a continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of the Persian language. Several scholars consider Tajik as a dialectal variety of Persian rather than a language on its own.[3][4][5] The popularity of this conception of Tajik as a variety of Persian was such that, during the period in which Tajik intellectuals were trying to establish Tajik as a language separate from Persian, prominent intellectual Sadriddin Ayni counterargued that Tajik was not a \"bastardised dialect\" of Persian.[6] The issue of whether Tajik and Persian are to be considered two dialects of a single language or two discrete languages[7] has political sides to it.[6]","image":"\"Tajik\"%2C_written_in_Cyrillic_(Tоҷикӣ)_and_Nastaliq_(تاجیکی).svg.png.webp"}
