{"title":"Fundamental theorem of calculus","summary":"The fundamental theorem of calculus is a theorem that links the concept of differentiating a function (calculating the gradient) with the concept of integrating a function (calculating the area under the curve). The two operations are inverses of each other apart from a constant value which depends where one starts to compute area.","image":"FTC_geometric.svg.png.webp"}
