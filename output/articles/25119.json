{"title":"Kundalini yoga","summary":"Kundalini yoga (kuṇḍalinī-yoga) derives from kundalini, defined in Vedantic culture as energy that lies dormant at the base of the spine until it is activated (as by the practice of yoga, blunt force trauma, breath work, or psychological trauma leading to spiritual awakening) and channeled upward through the chakras in the process of spiritual perfection.[1] Kundalini is believed by adherents to be power associated with the divine feminine, Shakti.[2][3][4][5] Kundalini yoga as a school of yoga is influenced by Shaktism and Tantra schools of Hinduism.[6] It derives its name through a focus on awakening kundalini energy through regular practice of mantra, tantra, yantra, yoga, or meditation.[7][8]","image":"Oriental_MS_Indic_beta_511_Wellcome_L0029118.jpg.webp"}
