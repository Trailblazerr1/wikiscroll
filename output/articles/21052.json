{"title":"Human skeleton","summary":"The human skeleton is the internal framework of the human body. It is composed of around 270 bones at birth â€“ this total decreases to around 206 bones by adulthood after some bones get fused together.[1] The bone mass in the skeleton reaches maximum density around age 21. The human skeleton can be divided into the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is formed by the vertebral column, the rib cage, the skull  and other associated bones. The appendicular skeleton, which is attached to the axial skeleton, is formed by the shoulder girdle, the pelvic girdle and the bones of the upper and lower limbs.","image":"Human-Skeleton.jpg.webp","url":"Human_skeleton"}
