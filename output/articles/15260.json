{"title":"Eucharist","summary":"The Eucharist (/ˈjuːkərɪst/; also known as Holy Communion and the Lord's Supper among other names) is a Christian rite that is considered a sacrament in most churches, and as an ordinance in others. According to the New Testament, the rite was instituted by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper; giving his disciples bread and wine during a Passover meal, he commanded them to \"do this in memory of me\" while referring to the bread as \"my body\" and the cup of wine as \"the new covenant in my blood\".[1][2][3] Through the eucharistic celebration Christians remember Christ's sacrifice of himself on the cross.[4]","image":"St_Michael_the_Archangel%2C_Findlay%2C_OH_-_bread_and_wine_crop_1.jpg.webp"}
