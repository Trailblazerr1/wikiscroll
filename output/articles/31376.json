{"title":"National Health Service","summary":"The National Health Service (NHS) is the umbrella term for the publicly funded healthcare systems of the United Kingdom (UK). Since 1948, they have been funded out of general taxation. There are three systems which are referred to using the \"NHS\" name (the NHS in England, NHS Scotland and NHS Wales). Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland was created separately[2] and is often locally referred to as \"the NHS\". The four systems were established in 1948 as part of major social reforms following the Second World War. The founding principles were that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of deliveryâ€”a health service based on clinical need, not ability to pay.[3] Each service provides a comprehensive range of health services, free at the point of use for people ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom apart from dental treatment and optical care.[4] In England, NHS patients have to pay prescription charges; some, such as those aged over 60 and certain state benefit recipients, are exempt.","image":"National_Health_Service_(England)_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"National_Health_Service"}
