{"title":"Cadillac CTS","summary":"The Cadillac CTS is an executive car that was manufactured and marketed by General Motors from 2003 to 2019 across three generations. Historically, it was priced similarly to cars on the compact luxury spectrum; but it has always been sized closely to its mid-size rivals. The third generation competes directly with the mid-size luxury cars. Initially available only as a 4-door sedan on the GM Sigma platform, GM had offered the second generation CTS in three body styles: 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, and 5-door sport wagon also using the Sigma platform â€” and the third generation was offered only as a sedan, using a stretched version of the GM Alpha platform.","image":"2008_Cadillac_CTS_--_NHTSA_1.jpg.webp"}
