{"title":"Genetic history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas","summary":"The genetic history of Indigenous peoples of the Americas (also named Amerindians or Amerinds in physical anthropology) is divided into two sharply distinct episodes: \nthe initial peopling of the Americas during about 20,000 to 14,000 years ago (20â€“14 kya), and European contact, after about 500 years ago.[1][2] The former is the determinant factor for the number of genetic lineages, zygosity mutations and founding haplotypes present in today's Indigenous Amerindian populations.[3]","image":"Global_frequency_distribution_map_of_haplogroup_Q-M242_(Y-DNA).png.webp"}
