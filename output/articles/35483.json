{"title":"Ponte Vecchio","summary":"The Ponte Vecchio (\"Old Bridge\", Italian pronunciation: [ˈponte ˈvɛkkjo])[1][2] is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River, in Florence, Italy. It is noted for the shops built along it; building shops on such bridges was once a common practice. Butchers, tanners, and farmers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewelers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers.[3]  The Ponte Vecchio's two neighboring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie.","image":"Ponte_Vecchio_from_East.jpg.webp","url":"Ponte_Vecchio"}
