{"title":"Russian battleship Potemkin","summary":"The Russian battleship Potemkin (Russian: Князь Потёмкин Таврический, romanized: Kniaz Potyomkin Tavricheskiy, \"Prince Potemkin of Taurida\") was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy's Black Sea Fleet. She became famous when the crew rebelled against the officers in June 1905 (during that year's revolution), which is now viewed as a first step towards the Russian Revolution of 1917. The mutiny later formed the basis of Sergei Eisenstein's 1925 silent film Battleship Potemkin.","image":"Panteleimon%2C_1906.jpg.webp","url":"Russian_battleship_Potemkin"}
