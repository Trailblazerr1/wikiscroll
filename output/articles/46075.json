{"title":"Trump wall","summary":"The Trump wall, commonly referred to as \"The Wall\", is an expansion of the Mexico–United States barrier that started during the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump.[1] Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump called for the construction of a border wall. He said that, if elected, he would \"build the wall and make Mexico pay for it\". Then-Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto said that Mexico would not pay for the wall, therefore the US paid for the wall to be constructed.[2][3][4]","image":"President_Trump_Travels_to_Arizona_(50040937841).jpg.webp","url":"Trump_wall"}
