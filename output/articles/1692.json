{"title":"ABO blood group system","summary":"The ABO blood group system is used to denote the presence of one, both, or neither of the A and B antigens on erythrocytes.[1] In human blood transfusions it is the most important of the 38 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized.[2] A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant.[3] The associated anti-A and anti-B antibodies are usually IgM antibodies, produced in the first years of life by sensitization to environmental substances such as food, bacteria, and viruses.","image":"ABO_blood_type.svg.png.webp","url":"ABO_blood_group_system"}
