{"title":"Democratic Socialists of America","summary":"The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is a multi-tendency socialist and labor-oriented nonprofit organization.[4] Its roots are in the Socialist Party of America (SPA), whose leaders included Eugene V. Debs, Norman Thomas and Michael Harrington.[5] In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's transformation into the Social Democrats, USA (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC). The DSOC, which Harrington described as \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the New American Movement (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the New Left movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the Old Left.[6]","image":"Democratic_Socialists_of_America_Logo_(official).svg.png.webp"}
