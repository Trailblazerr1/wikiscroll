{"title":"Lumen (unit)","summary":"The lumen (symbol: lm) is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source per unit of time. Luminous flux differs from power (radiant flux) in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted, while luminous flux is weighted according to a model (a \"luminosity function\") of the human eye's sensitivity to various wavelengths. One lux is one lumen per square metre.","image":"V-LIGHT_A314.JPG.webp","url":"Lumen_(unit)"}
