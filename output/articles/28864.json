{"title":"Mata Hari","summary":"Margaretha Geertruida MacLeod (née Zelle; 7 August 1876 – 15 October 1917), better known by the stage name Mata Hari (/ˈmɑːtə ˈhɑːri/), was a Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy for Germany during World War I. Many people still believe she was innocent,[1] and condemned only because the French Army needed a scapegoat.[2][3] She was executed by firing squad in France.[4]","image":"Mata_Hari_13.jpg.webp"}
