{"title":"Greater Iran","summary":"Greater Iran (Persian: ایران بزرگ‎, romanized: Irān-e Bozorg) refers to the regions of Western Asia, Central Asia, South Asia and Transcaucasia where both Iranian culture and Iranian languages have had a significant presence and impact. Historically, these were regions long-ruled by dynasties of various Iranian empires[note 1][2][3][4] which incorporated considerable aspects of Persian culture through extensive contact with them,[note 2] or where sufficient Iranian peoples settled to still maintain communities who patronize their respective cultures.[note 3] It roughly corresponds to the Iranian Plateau and its bordering plains.[1][5] The Encyclopædia Iranica uses the term Iranian Cultural Continent to describe this region.[6]","image":"Greater_Iran_Map.png.webp","url":"Greater_Iran"}
