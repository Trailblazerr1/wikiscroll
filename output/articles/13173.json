{"title":"Distance","summary":"Distance is a numerical measurement of how far apart objects or points are. In physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g. \"two counties over\"). The distance from a point A to a point B is sometimes denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n        A\n        B\n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |AB|}\n  \n. In most cases, \"distance from A to B\" is interchangeable with \"distance from B to A\". In mathematics, a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance; it is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be \"close to\", or \"far away from\" each other.\nIn psychology and social sciences, distance is a non-numerical measurement; Psychological distance is defined as \"the different ways in which an object might be removed from\" the self along dimensions such as \"time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality.[1]","image":"fa0bf6dba77a8b8734eb4356cac20b49e9a80c3c.svg"}
