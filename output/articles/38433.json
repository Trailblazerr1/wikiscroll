{"title":"Romanization of Japanese","summary":"The romanization of Japanese is the use of Latin script to write the Japanese language.[1] This method of writing is sometimes referred to in Japanese as rōmaji (ローマ字, literally, \"Roman letters\"; [ɾoːma(d)ʑi] (listen) or [ɾoːmaꜜ(d)ʑi]). There are several different romanization systems. The three main ones are Hepburn romanization, Kunrei-shiki romanization (ISO 3602), and Nihon-shiki romanization (ISO 3602 Strict). Variants of the Hepburn system are the most widely used.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
