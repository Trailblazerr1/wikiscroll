{"title":"Qin dynasty","summary":"The Qin dynasty, or Ch'in[4] dynasty in Wade–Giles romanization, was the first dynasty of Imperial China,[5] lasting from 221 to 206 BC. Named for its heartland in Qin state (modern Gansu and Shaanxi), the dynasty was founded by Qin Shi Huang, the First Emperor of Qin. The strength of the Qin state was greatly increased by the Legalist reforms of Shang Yang in the fourth century BC, during the Warring States period. In the mid and late third century BC, the Qin state carried out a series of swift conquests, first ending the powerless Zhou dynasty and eventually conquering the other six of the Seven Warring States. Its 15 years was the shortest major dynasty in Chinese history, consisting of only two emperors, and its territory was the Yellow and Yangzi river heartland, not the modern China familiar from our maps.[6] Despite its short reign, however, the lessons and strategies of the Qin shaped the Han dynasty and became the starting point of the Chinese imperial system that lasted from 221 BC, with interruption, development, and adaptation, until 1912 AD.","image":"Inscription_on_Imperial_Seal_of_China_\"受命於天_既壽永昌\".svg.png.webp","url":"Qin_dynasty"}
