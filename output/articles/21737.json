{"title":"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea","summary":"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the second album by American rock band Neutral Milk Hotel, released on February 10, 1998 by Merge Records. The music is predominantly indie rock and psychedelic folk, and is characterized by an intentionally low quality sound. Traditional instruments like the guitar and drums are paired with less conventional instruments such as a singing saw, zanzithophone, and uilleann pipes. The lyrics are surrealistic and opaque, with themes ranging from nostalgia to love.","image":"In_the_aeroplane_over_the_sea_album_cover_copy.jpg.webp","url":"In_the_Aeroplane_Over_the_Sea"}
