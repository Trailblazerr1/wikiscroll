{"title":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions","summary":"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962; second edition 1970; third edition 1996; fourth edition 2012) is a book about the history of science by the philosopher Thomas S. Kuhn. Its publication was a landmark event in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science.  Kuhn challenged the then prevailing view of progress in science in which scientific progress was viewed as \"development-by-accumulation\" of accepted facts and theories. Kuhn argued for an episodic model in which periods of conceptual continuity where there is cumulative progress, which Kuhn referred to as periods of \"normal science\", were interrupted by periods of revolutionary science. The discovery of \"anomalies\" during revolutions in science leads to new paradigms.  New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere \"puzzle-solving\" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the \"map\" directing new research.[1]","image":"Structure-of-scientific-revolutions-1st-ed-pb.png.webp","url":"The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions"}
