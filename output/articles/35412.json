{"title":"Pollen","summary":"Pollen is a powdery substance consisting of pollen grains which are microsporophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the gametophytes during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil of flowering plants, or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates, producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics. \nPollen in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the anther of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination.[1] In a case of self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower.[1]","image":"Misc_pollen_colorized.jpg.webp"}
