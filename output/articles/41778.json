{"title":"Split-complex number","summary":"In algebra, a split complex number (or hyperbolic number, also perplex number, double number) has two real number components x and y, and is written z = x + y j, where j2 = 1.  The conjugate of z is z∗ = x − y j. Since j2 = 1, the product of a number z with its conjugate is zz∗ = x2 − y2, an isotropic quadratic form, N(z) = x2 − y2.","image":"87302196546348a03821e4a3c01ceb85a301a834.svg","url":"Split-complex_number"}
