{"title":"Convertible","summary":"A convertible or cabriolet (/ˌkæbrioʊˈleɪ/) is a passenger car that can be driven with or without a roof in place. The methods of retracting and storing the roof vary between models.\nA convertible allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. Potential drawbacks of convertibles are reduced structural rigidity (requiring significant engineering and modification to counteract the effects of removing a car's roof)[1] and cargo space.[2]","image":"2006-2007_galaxy_gray.jpg.webp"}
