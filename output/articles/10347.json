{"title":"Clubfoot","summary":"Clubfoot is a birth defect where one or both feet are rotated inward and downward.[1][2] The affected foot and leg may be smaller than the other.[1] Approximately 50% of cases of clubfoot affect both feet.[1][5] Most of the time, it is not associated with other problems.[1] Without treatment, the foot remains deformed, and people walk on the sides of their feet.[3] This may lead to pain and difficulty walking.[6]","image":"Pied_bot%2C_varus_Ã©quin_(bilateral).jpg.webp"}
