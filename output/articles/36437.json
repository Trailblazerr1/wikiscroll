{"title":"Pterosaur","summary":"Pterosaurs (/ˈtɛrəsɔːr, ˈtɛroʊ-/;[5][6] from Greek pteron and sauros, meaning \"wing lizard\") were flying reptiles of the extinct clade or order Pterosauria. They existed during most of the Mesozoic: from the late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous (228 to 66 million years ago[7]). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger.[8]","image":"Pteranodon_sternbergi_pair.jpg.webp","url":"Pterosaur"}
