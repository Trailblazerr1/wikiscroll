{"title":"Suicide attack","summary":"A suicide attack is any violent attack, usually involving an explosion, in which attackers accept their own death as a direct result of the attacking method used. Suicide attacks have occurred throughout history, often as part of a military campaign (as with the Japanese kamikaze pilots of 1944â€“1945 during World War II),  and more recently as part of terrorist campaigns (such as the September 11 attacks in 2001).","image":"USS_Bunker_Hill_(CV-17)_afire_after_being_hit_by_Kamikazes_off_Okinawa%2C_11_May_1945_(80-G-274266).jpg.webp"}
