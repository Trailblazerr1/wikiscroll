{"title":"Martin Buber","summary":"Martin Buber (Hebrew: מרטין בובר‎; German: Martin Buber; Yiddish: מארטין בובער‎; February 8, 1878 – June 13, 1965) was an Austrian Jewish and Israeli philosopher best known for his philosophy of dialogue, a form of existentialism centered on the distinction between the I–Thou relationship and the I–It relationship.[2] Born in Vienna, Buber came from a family of observant Jews, but broke with Jewish custom to pursue secular studies in philosophy. In 1902, he became the editor of the weekly Die Welt, the central organ of the Zionist movement, although he later withdrew from organizational work in Zionism. In 1923, Buber wrote his famous essay on existence, Ich und Du (later translated into English as I and Thou),[3] and in 1925, he began translating the Hebrew Bible into the German language reflecting the patterns of the Hebrew language.","image":"Martin_Buber_portrait.jpg.webp","url":"Martin_Buber"}
