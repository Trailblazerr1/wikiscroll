{"title":"Advance-fee scam","summary":"An advance-fee scam is a form of fraud and one of the most common types of confidence tricks. The scam typically involves promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster claims will be used to obtain the large sum. If a victim makes the payment, the fraudster either invents a series of further fees for the victim to pay or simply disappears.[1]","image":"Scam_letter_posted_within_South_Africa.jpg.webp"}
