{"title":"Alloy steel","summary":"Alloy steel is steel that is alloyed with a variety of elements in total amounts between 1.0% and 50% by weight to improve its mechanical properties. Alloy steels are broken down into two groups: low alloy steels and high alloy steels. The difference between the two is disputed. Smith and Hashemi define the difference at 4.0%, while Degarmo, et al., define it at 8.0%.[1][2] Most commonly, the phrase \"alloy steel\" refers to low-alloy steels.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Alloy_steel"}
