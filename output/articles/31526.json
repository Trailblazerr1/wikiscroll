{"title":"Nazca Lines","summary":"The Nazca Lines /ˈnæzkɑː/ are a group of very large geoglyphs made in the soil of the Nazca Desert in southern Peru.[1] They were created between 500 BC and AD 500 by people making depressions or shallow incisions in the desert floor, removing pebbles and leaving differently colored dirt exposed.[2] In the years leading up to 2020, between 80 and 100 new figures had been found with the use of drones, and archaeologists believe that there are more to be found.[3]","image":"Líneas_de_Nazca%2C_Nazca%2C_Perú%2C_2015-07-29%2C_DD_49.JPG.webp","url":"Nazca_Lines"}
