{"title":"Terrorism","summary":"Terrorism is, in its broadest sense, the unlawful use of intentional violence to achieve political aims.[1] The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel).[2] The terms \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century[3] but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the Northern Ireland conflict, the Basque conflict, and the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States.","image":"UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg.webp","url":"Terrorism"}
