{"title":"Arctic wolf","summary":"The Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos), also known as the white wolf or polar wolf, is a subspecies of grey wolf native to the High Arctic tundra of Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands, from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island.[1][2] Unlike some populations that move between tundra and forest regions,[3] Arctic wolves spend their entire lives north of the northern treeline.[4][5] Their distribution to south is limited to the northern fringes of the Middle Arctic tundra on the southern half of Prince of Wales and Somerset Islands.[6] It is a medium-sized subspecies, distinguished from the northwestern wolf by its smaller size, its whiter colouration, its narrower braincase,[7] and larger carnassials.[8] Since 1930, there has been a progressive reduction in size in Arctic wolf skulls, which is likely the result of wolf-dog hybridization.[8]","image":"Polarwolf004.jpg.webp"}
