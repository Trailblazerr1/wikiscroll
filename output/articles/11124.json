{"title":"Cooper Car Company","summary":"The Cooper Car Company is a British car manufacturer founded in December 1947[1] by Charles Cooper and his son John Cooper.  Together with John's boyhood friend, Eric Brandon, they began by building racing cars in Charles's small garage in Surbiton, Surrey, England, in 1946. Through the 1950s and early 1960s they reached motor racing's highest levels as their rear-engined, single-seat cars competed in both Formula One and the Indianapolis 500, and their Mini Cooper dominated rally racing.  The Cooper name lives on in the Cooper versions of the Mini production cars that are built in England, but is now owned and marketed by BMW.","image":"Cooper_Car_Company.png.webp","url":"Cooper_Car_Company"}
