{"title":"Heinrich event","summary":"A Heinrich event is a natural phenomenon in which large groups of icebergs break off from glaciers and traverse the North Atlantic. First described by marine geologist Hartmut Heinrich (Heinrich, H., 1988), they occurred during five of the last seven glacial periods\nover the past 640,000 years (Hodell, et al., 2008). Heinrich events are particularly well documented for the last glacial period but notably absent from the penultimate glaciation (Obrochta et al., 2014). The icebergs contained rock mass, eroded by the glaciers, and as they melted, this material was dropped to the sea floor as ice rafted debris (abbreviated to \"IRD\") forming deposits called Heinrich layers.","image":"Evolution_of_temperature_in_the_Post-Glacial_period_according_to_Greenland_ice_cores.jpg.webp"}
