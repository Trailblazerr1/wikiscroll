{"title":"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo","summary":"\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\" is the ninth episode of the first season of the American animated television series South Park. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 17, 1997. This episode marks the first appearances of Craig Tucker, Mr. Hankey, and the school counselor Mr. Mackey. In the episode, the Jewish character Kyle feels excluded from the town's celebrations during Christmas, and is comforted by Mr. Hankey, a talking and singing lump of feces wearing a Santa hat. Mr. Hankey does not come alive in the presence of other characters, so they think that Kyle is delusional. In another plot strand, the townspeople remove all religious aspects of Christmas from South Park to remain politically correct and inoffensive.","image":"Mr_hankey_the_xmas_poo.jpg.webp"}
