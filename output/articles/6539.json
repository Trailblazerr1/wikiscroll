{"title":"Bill Finger","summary":"Milton Finger (February 8, 1914[1] – January 18, 1974),[2][3] known professionally and personally as Bill Finger,[2] was an American comic strip, comic book, film and television writer who was the uncredited (until 2015) co-creator (with Bob Kane) of the DC Comics superhero character Batman (launched in 1939). Despite making major (sometimes, signature) contributions as an innovative writer, visionary mythos/world builder and illustration architect, Finger (and other creators of his era) was often relegated to ghostwriter status on many comics -- including Batman, and Green Lantern (the original, Alan Scott version). While Kane privately admitted in a 1980s audio interview with his autobiographer that Finger was responsible for \"50-75% of all the creativity in Batman,\" for decades he publicly denied Finger had been anything more than a subcontractor executing Kane’s ideas. As a result, Finger died in obscurity and poverty while the Batman brand – and Kane – amassed international fame and wealth.[4] In the 2000s, Finger biographer Marc Tyler Nobleman’s research uncovered previously unknown heirs. At the urging of Nobleman, the online comics fan community and others, Finger's granddaughter revived the fight to restore his lost legacy, which continued for years. In 2015, DC Comics’ parent company conditionally agreed to recognize Finger’s intellectual property claim as co-creator of the Batman characters and mythos, officially adding his name, going forward, to the “created by” credit line Kane had gotten contractually guaranteed in 1939.[5]","image":"Bill_finger_photo.jpg.webp","url":"Bill_Finger"}
