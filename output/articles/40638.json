{"title":"Signal-to-noise ratio","summary":"Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power, often expressed in decibels. A ratio higher than 1:1 (greater than 0Â dB) indicates more signal than noise.","image":"08b8624b51933d2f1f11233693840cd5139e42c1.svg"}
