{"title":"1948 Palestinian exodus","summary":"The 1948 Palestinian exodus occurred when more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs – about half of prewar Palestine's Arab population – fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Palestine war.[1] The exodus was a central component of the fracturing, dispossession and displacement of Palestinian society, known as the Nakba,[2][3] in which between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were destroyed and others subject to Hebraization of Palestinian place names,[4] and also refers to the wider period of war itself and the subsequent oppression up to the present day.[5]","image":"Palestinian_refugees.jpg.webp"}
