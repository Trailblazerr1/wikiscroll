{"title":"Azimuthal quantum number","summary":"The azimuthal quantum number is a quantum number for an atomic orbital that determines its orbital angular momentum and describes the shape of the orbital.  The azimuthal quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers that describe the unique quantum state of an electron (the others being the principal quantum number, the magnetic quantum number, and the spin quantum number).  It is also known as the orbital angular momentum quantum number, orbital quantum number or second quantum number, and is symbolized as â„“ (pronounced ell).","image":"HAtomOrbitals.png.webp","url":"Azimuthal_quantum_number"}
