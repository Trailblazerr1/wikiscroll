{"title":"Timeline of plant evolution","summary":"This article attempts to place key plant innovations in a geological context.  It concerns itself only with novel adaptations and events that had a major ecological significance, not those that are of solely anthropological interest.  The timeline displays a graphical representation of the adaptations; the text attempts to explain the nature and robustness of the evidence.","image":"Cooksonia_pertoni_revised.png.webp"}
