{"title":"Groundwater pollution","summary":"Groundwater pollution (also called groundwater contamination) occurs when pollutants are released to the ground and make their way into groundwater. This type of water pollution can also occur naturally due to the presence of a minor and unwanted constituent, contaminant, or impurity in the groundwater, in which case it is more likely referred to as contamination rather than pollution. Pollution can occur from on-site sanitation systems, landfills, effluent from wastewater treatment plants, leaking sewers, petrol filling stations or from over application of fertilizers in agriculture. Pollution (or contamination) can also occur from naturally occurring contaminants, such as arsenic or fluoride.[1] Using polluted groundwater causes hazards to public health through poisoning or the spread of disease (water-borne diseases).","image":"Pit_latrine_and_well_in_close_proximity_(3794846044).jpg.webp","url":"Groundwater_pollution"}
