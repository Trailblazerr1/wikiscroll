{"title":"Equilibrium constant","summary":"The equilibrium constant of a chemical reaction is the value of its reaction quotient at chemical equilibrium, a state approached by a dynamic chemical system after sufficient time has elapsed at which its composition has no measurable tendency towards further change. For a given set of reaction conditions, the equilibrium constant is independent of the initial analytical concentrations of the reactant and product species in the mixture.  Thus, given the initial composition of a system, known equilibrium constant values can be used to determine the composition of the system at equilibrium.  However, reaction parameters like temperature, solvent, and ionic strength may all influence the value of the equilibrium constant.","image":"bc489a976b5875e8540df14669be3bcb7556c202.svg"}
