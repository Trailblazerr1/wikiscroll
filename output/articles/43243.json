{"title":"Tabernacle","summary":"According to the Hebrew Bible, the tabernacle (Hebrew: מִשְׁכַּן‎, mishkān, meaning \"residence\" or \"dwelling place\"), also known as the Tent of the Congregation (אֹ֣הֶל מוֹעֵד֩ ’ōhel mō‘êḏ, also Tent of Meeting, etc.), was the portable earthly dwelling place of Yahweh (the God of Israel) used by the Israelites from the Exodus until the conquest of Canaan. Moses was instructed at Mount Sinai to construct and transport the tabernacle[1] with the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness and their subsequent conquest of the Promised Land. After 440 years, Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling-place of God.","image":"Stiftshuette_Modell_Timnapark.jpg.webp","url":"Tabernacle"}
