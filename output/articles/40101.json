{"title":"Serial port","summary":"In computing, a serial port is a serial communication interface through which information transfers in or out sequentially one bit at a time.[1]  This is in contrast to a parallel port, which communicates multiple bits simultaneously in parallel. Throughout most of the history of personal computers, data has been transferred through serial ports to devices such as modems, terminals, various peripherals, and directly between computers.","image":"Serial_port_(9-pin).jpg.webp"}
