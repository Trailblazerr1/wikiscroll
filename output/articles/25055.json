{"title":"Kraftwerk","summary":"Kraftwerk (German: [ˈkʁaftvɛɐ̯k], lit. \"power station\") is a German band formed in Düsseldorf in 1969 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of electronic music, Kraftwerk was among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. Wolfgang Flür joined the band in 1974 and Karl Bartos in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet.","image":"Kraftwerk_-_Finlandia_Talo_Helsinki_-_Thursday_15th_February_2018_KraftWHelsink150218-4_(40298108672).jpg.webp","url":"Kraftwerk"}
