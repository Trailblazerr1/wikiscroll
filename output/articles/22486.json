{"title":"Irène Joliot-Curie","summary":"Irène Joliot-Curie (French: [iʁɛn ʒɔljo kyʁi] (listen); 12 September 1897 – 17 March 1956) was a French chemist, physicist, and a politician of partly Polish ancestry, the elder daughter of Marie Curie and Pierre Curie, and the wife of Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Jointly with her husband, Joliot-Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935 for their discovery of artificial radioactivity, making them the second ever married couple (after her parents) to win the Nobel Prize, while adding to the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. This made the Curies the family with the most Nobel laureates to date.[1] She was also one of the first three women to be a member of a French government, becoming undersecretary for Scientific Research under the Popular Front in 1936.[2] Both children of the Joliot-Curies, Hélène and Pierre, are also prominent scientists.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
