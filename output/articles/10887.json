{"title":"Confession of Peter","summary":"In Christianity, the Confession of Peter (translated from the Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: Confessio Petri) refers to an episode in the New Testament in which the Apostle Peter proclaims Jesus to be the Christ (Jewish Messiah). The proclamation is described in the three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew 16:13–20, Mark 8:27–30 and Luke 9:18–21.[1][2] Depending on which gospel one reads, Peter either says: 'You are the Messiah' or 'the Christ' (Mark 8:29); or 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God',[1] (Matthew 16:16), or 'God's Messiah' or 'The Christ of God' (Luke 9:20).[3]","image":"Peter_proclaims_Jesus.jpg.webp","url":"Confession_of_Peter"}
