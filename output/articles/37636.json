{"title":"Republic","summary":"A republic (from Latin  res publicaÂ 'public affair') is a form of government in which \"power is held by the people and their elected representatives\".[1] In republics, the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the private concern or property of the rulers. The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.[2][3][4]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp"}
