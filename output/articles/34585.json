The duo's debut single, \"West End Girls\", was first released in 1984 but failed to chart in most regions.

The album peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI).[1][4] It also peaked at number seven on the Billboard 200 in the United States and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[5][6] The following summer they released \"It's a Sin\", the lead single from their second album, Actually.
