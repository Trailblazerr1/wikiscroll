{"title":"Guy Fawkes Night","summary":"Guy Fawkes Night, also known as Guy Fawkes Day, Bonfire Night and Fireworks Night, is an annual commemoration observed on 5 November, primarily in Great Britain, involving bonfires and fireworks displays. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605 O.S., when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. The Catholic plotters had intended to assassinate Protestant king James I and his parliament. Celebrating that the king had survived, people lit bonfires around London; and months later, the  Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure.","image":"Windsor_castle_guyfawkesnight1776.jpg.webp","url":"Guy_Fawkes_Night"}
