{"title":"Sepal","summary":"A sepal (/ˈsɛpəl/ or /ˈsiːpəl/)[1][2][3] is a part of the flower of angiosperms (flowering plants). Usually green, sepals typically function as protection for the flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom.[4] The term sepalum was coined by Noël Martin Joseph de Necker in 1790, and derived from Greek σκέπη skepē 'covering'.[5][6]","image":"Mature_flower_diagram.svg.png.webp","url":"Sepal"}
