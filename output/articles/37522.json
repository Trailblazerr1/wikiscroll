{"title":"Rehoboam","summary":"Rehoboam (/ˌriːəˈboʊ.əm/; Hebrew: רְחַבְעָם‎, Rəḥaḇʿām; Greek: Ροβοάμ, Rovoam; Latin: Roboam) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the last monarch of the United Kingdom of Israel and the first monarch of the Kingdom of Judah after the former's split. He was a son of and the successor to Solomon and a grandson of David. In the account of I Kings and II Chronicles, Rehoboam was initially a king of the United Monarchy, but later saw his rule limited to only the Kingdom of Judah in the south following a rebellion by the ten northern tribes of Israel in 932/931 BCE, which led to the formation of the independent Kingdom of Israel under the rule of Jeroboam in the north.","image":"Rehoboam._Fragment_of_Wall_Painting_from_Basel_Town_Hall_Council_Chamber%2C_by_Hans_Holbein_the_Younger..jpg.webp","url":"Rehoboam"}
