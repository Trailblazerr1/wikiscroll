{"title":"Civil rights movement","summary":"The 1954â€“1968 civil rights movement[lower-alpha 2] in the United States was preceded by a decades-long campaign by African Americans and their like-minded allies to end legalized racial discrimination, disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States. The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, although it made its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests. The social movement's major nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans.","image":"lossy-page1-300px-Civil_Rights_March_on_Washington%2C_D.C._(Leaders_marching_from_the_Washington_Monument_to_the_Lincoln_Memorial)_-_NARA_-_542010.tif.jpg.webp","url":"Civil_rights_movement"}
