{"title":"Tetris","summary":"Tetris (Russian: Тéтрис [ˈtʲɛtrʲɪs]) is a puzzle video game created by Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996, who co-founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing.","image":"Typical_Tetris_Game.svg.png.webp"}
