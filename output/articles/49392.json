{"title":"Zajal","summary":"Zajal (Arabic: زجل‎) is a traditional form of oral strophic poetry declaimed in a colloquial dialect. While there is little evidence of the exact origins of the zajal, the earliest recorded zajal poet was the poet Ibn Quzman of al-Andalus who lived from 1078 to 1160.[1] It is generally conceded that the early ancestors of Levantine dialectical poetry were the Andalusian zajal and muwashshaḥah, brought to Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean by Moors fleeing Spain in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.[2] An early master of Egyptian zajal was the fourteenth century zajjāl Abu ʿAbd Allāh al-Ghubārī.[3]  Zajal's origins may be ancient but it can be traced  back to at least the 12th century. Today it is most alive in the Levant (especially in Lebanon (see below), Palestine and in Jordan where professional zajal practitioners can attain high levels of recognition and popularity) as well as the Maghreb, particularly Morocco and Algeria.  Zajal is semi-improvised and semi-sung and is often performed  in the format  of a debate between zajjalin (poets who improvise the zajal).  It is usually accompanied by  percussive musical instruments (with the occasional  wind instrument, e.g. the ney) and a chorus of men (and more recently, women) who sing parts of the verse.","image":"Hadîth_Bayâd_wa_Riyâd_-_BAV_Ar368_f10r_-_Garden_scene.jpg.webp"}
