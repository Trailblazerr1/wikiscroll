{"title":"List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones","summary":"In the United Kingdom, Christmas number ones are singles that are top of the UK Singles Chart in the week in which Christmas Day falls.[nb 1] The singles have often been novelty songs, charity songs or songs with a Christmas theme. Traditionally the volume of record sales in the UK peaks at Christmas,[1] with the Christmas number one being considered especially prestigious, more so than any other time of year,[2][3] with bookmakers taking bets on the act who will be the chart topper.[4] Many of the Christmas number ones were also the best-selling song of the year. Due to the common practice of dating a chart by the date on which the week ends, the Christmas chart is dated the end of the week containing 25 December. The most recent Christmas number one single is \"Don't Stop Me Eatin'\" by LadBaby.","image":"Al_Martino.jpg.webp"}
