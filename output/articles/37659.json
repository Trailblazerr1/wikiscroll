{"title":"Republika Srpska (1992–1995)","summary":"The Republika Srpska (RS; Serbian Cyrillic: Република Српска) was a self-proclaimed proto-state in Southeastern Europe under the control of the Army of Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War. It claimed to be a sovereign state, though this claim was not recognized by the Bosnian government (whose territory the RS was recognized as nominally being a part of), the United Nations, or any other recognized state. For the first few months of its existence, it was known as the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbian Cyrillic: Српска Република Босна и Херцеговина).","image":"Flag_of_the_Republika_Srpska.svg.png.webp"}
