{"title":"Imperial examination","summary":"The Chinese imperial examinations, or keju (lit. \"subject recommendation\"), was a civil service examination system in Imperial China for selecting candidates for the state bureaucracy. The concept of choosing bureaucrats by merit rather than birth started early in Chinese history but using written examinations as a tool of selection started in earnest during the mid-Tang dynasty. The system became dominant during the Song dynasty and lasted until it was abolished in the late Qing dynasty reforms in 1905.","image":"Ming-Beamtenpr√ºfungen1.jpg.webp","url":"Imperial_examination"}
