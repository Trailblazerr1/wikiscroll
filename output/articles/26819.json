{"title":"List of current cardinals","summary":"Cardinals are senior members of the clergy of the Catholic Church. They are almost always bishops and generally hold important roles within the church, such as governing prominent archdioceses or managing dicasteries within the Roman Curia. Cardinals are created in consistories by the pope and one of their foremost duties is the election of a new pope (invariably from among themselves, although not a formal requirement) when the Holy See is vacant, following the death or the resignation of the reigning pontiff. The body of all cardinals is collectively known as the College of Cardinals.[1][2]","image":"Cardinal_-_choir_dress.svg.png.webp","url":"List_of_current_cardinals"}
