{"title":"Biodiversity","summary":"Biodiversity is the biological variety and variability of life on Earth. Biodiversity is a measure of variation at the genetic, species, and ecosystem level.[1] Terrestrial biodiversity is usually greater near the equator,[2] which is the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity.[3] Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth, and is richer in the tropics.[4] These tropical forest ecosystems cover less than ten percent of earth's surface, and contain about ninety percent of the world's species.[5] Marine biodiversity is usually higher along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest, and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans.[6] There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity.[6] Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots,[7] and has been increasing through time,[8][9] but will be likely to slow in the future as a primary result of deforestation.[10] It encompasses the evolutionary, ecological, and cultural processes that sustain life.","image":"Fungi_of_Saskatchewan.JPG.webp"}
