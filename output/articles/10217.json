{"title":"Claudius","summary":"Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (/ˈklɔːdiəs/ KLAW-dee-əs; 1 August 10 BC – 13 October AD 54) was the fourth  Roman emperor, ruling from AD 41 to 54.  A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Claudius was born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate. He was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins.[5] Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, he was ostracized by his family and was excluded from public office until his consulship (which was shared with his nephew, Caligula, in 37).","image":"Claudius_crop.jpg.webp"}
