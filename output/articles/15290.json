{"title":"Eukaryote","summary":"Eukaryotes (/juːˈkærioʊts, -əts/) are organisms whose cells have a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear envelope.[3][4][5] Eukaryotes belong to the domain Eukaryota or Eukarya; their name comes from the Greek εὖ (eu, \"well\" or \"good\") and κάρυον (karyon, \"nut\" or \"kernel\").[6] The domain Eukaryota makes up one of the three domains of life;  bacteria and archaea (the prokaryotes) make up the other two domains. The eukaryotes are usually now regarded as having emerged in the Archaea or as a sister of the now cultivated Asgard archaea.[7][8][9][10][11] Eukaryotes represent a tiny minority of the number of organisms;[12] however, due to their generally much larger size, their collective global biomass is estimated to be about equal to that of prokaryotes.[12] Eukaryotes emerged approximately 2.1–1.6 billion years ago, during the Proterozoic eon, likely as flagellated phagotrophs.[13]","image":"Eukaryota_diversity_2.jpg.webp"}
