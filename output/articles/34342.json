{"title":"Penalty shoot-out (association football)","summary":"A penalty shoot-out (officially kicks from the penalty mark)[1] is a method of determining which team is awarded victory in an association football match that cannot end in a draw, when the score is tied after the normal time as well as extra time (if used) have expired. In a penalty shoot-out, each team takes turns shooting at goal from the penalty mark, with the goal defended only by the opposing team's goalkeeper. Each team has five shots which must be taken by different kickers; the team that makes more successful kicks is declared the victor. Shoot-outs finish as soon as one team has an insurmountable lead. If scores are level after five pairs of shots, the shootout progresses into additional \"sudden-death\" rounds.[1] Balls successfully kicked into the goal during a shoot-out do not count as goals for the individual kickers or the team, and are tallied separately from the goals scored during normal play (including extra time, if any). Although the procedure for each individual kick in the shoot-out resembles that of a penalty kick, there are some differences. Most notably, neither the kicker nor any player other than the goalkeeper may play the ball again once it has been kicked.","image":"Hearts_vs._Gretna_Scottish_Cup_final.jpg.webp","url":"Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)"}
