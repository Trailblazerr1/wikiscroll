{"title":"Mercury Prize","summary":"The Mercury Prize, formerly called the Mercury Music Prize, is an annual music prize awarded for the best album released in the United Kingdom by a British or Irish act.[1] It was created by Jon Webster and Robert Chandler in association with the British Phonographic Industry and British Association of Record Dealers in 1992 as an alternative to the Brit Awards. The prize was originally sponsored by Mercury Communications, a brand owned by Cable & Wireless,[2] from which the prize gets its name. It was later sponsored by Technics[3] (1998 to 2001), Panasonic[2] (2002 and 2003), Nationwide Building Society (2004 to 2008) and Barclaycard (2009â€“14).[4][5] The 2015 prize was sponsored by the BBC,[5] while in 2016 it was announced that a three-year deal had been struck with Hyundai to sponsor the event.[6]","image":"Mercury_Prize_logo.png.webp"}
