{"title":"Save (baseball)","summary":"In baseball, a save (abbreviated SV or S) is credited to a pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team under certain prescribed circumstances. Most commonly a pitcher earns a save by entering in the ninth inning of a game in which his team is winning by three or fewer runs and finishing the game by pitching one inning without losing the lead.[1] The number of saves or percentage of save opportunities successfully converted are oft-cited statistics of relief pitchers, particularly those in the closer role. The save statistic was created by journalist Jerome Holtzman in 1959 to \"measure the effectiveness of relief pitchers\" and was adopted as an official MLB statistic in 1969.[2][3] The save has been retroactively measured for pitchers before that date. Mariano Rivera is MLB's all-time leader in regular-season saves with 652, while Francisco Rodr√≠guez earned the most saves in a single season with 62 in 2008.","image":"Mariano_Rivera_allison_7_29_07.jpg.webp"}
