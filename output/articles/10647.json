{"title":"Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)","summary":"The Commissioner's Trophy is a trophy presented each year by the Commissioner of Baseball to the MLB team that wins the World Series. Recent trophy designs contain flags representing each team in North America's top two leagues, the National League and the American League.[1][2] The two participating teams in that year's World Series were previously represented by two press pins set on the base of the trophy. It is the only championship trophy of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in North America that is not named after a particular person[3] (contrasting with the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup,[4] Major League Soccer's Philip F. Anschutz Trophy,[5] the National Basketball Association's Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy,[6] and the National Football League's Vince Lombardi Trophy).[7]","image":"World_Series_Trophy_(48262268286).jpg.webp"}
