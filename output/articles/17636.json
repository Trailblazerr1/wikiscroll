{"title":"General anaesthetic","summary":"General anaesthetics (or anesthetics, see spelling differences) are often defined as compounds that induce a loss of consciousness in humans or loss of righting reflex in animals. Clinical definitions are also extended to include an induced coma that causes lack of awareness to painful stimuli, sufficient to facilitate surgical applications in clinical and veterinary practice. General anaesthetics do not act as analgesics and should also not be confused with sedatives. General anaesthetics are a structurally diverse group of compounds whose mechanisms encompasses multiple biological targets involved in the control of neuronal pathways. The precise workings are the subject of some debate and ongoing research.[1]","image":"US_Navy_030513-N-1577S-001_Lt._Cmdr._Joe_Casey%2C_Ship's_Anesthetist%2C_trains_on_anesthetic_procedures_with_Hospital_Corpsman_3rd_Class_Eric_Wichman_aboard_USS_Nimitz_(CVN_68).jpg.webp","url":"General_anaesthetic"}
