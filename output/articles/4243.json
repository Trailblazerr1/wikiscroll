{"title":"Arboreal locomotion","summary":"Arboreal locomotion is the locomotion of animals in trees.  In habitats in which trees are present, animals have evolved to move in them. Some animals may scale trees only occasionally, but others are exclusively arboreal. The habitats pose numerous mechanical challenges to animals moving through them and lead to a variety of anatomical, behavioral and ecological consequences as well as variations throughout different species.[1]  Furthermore, many of these same principles may be applied to climbing without trees, such as on rock piles or mountains.","image":"Leopard_on_the_tree.jpg.webp"}
