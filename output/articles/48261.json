{"title":"Westerlies","summary":"The westerlies, anti-trades,[1] or prevailing westerlies, are  prevailing winds from the west toward the east in the middle latitudes between 30 and 60 degrees latitude. They originate from the high-pressure areas in the horse latitudes and trend towards the poles and steer extratropical cyclones in this general manner.[2] Tropical cyclones which cross the subtropical ridge axis into the westerlies recurve due to the increased westerly flow. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.","image":"Map_prevailing_winds_on_earth.png.webp"}
