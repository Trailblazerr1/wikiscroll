{"title":"Monarchy of Denmark","summary":"The monarchy of Denmark is a constitutional institution and a historic office of the Kingdom of Denmark. The Kingdom includes Denmark proper, as well as the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland. The Kingdom of Denmark was already consolidated in the 8th century, whose rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources (and in some late Frisian sources) as \"kings\" (reges). Under the rule of King Gudfred in 804 the Kingdom may have included all the major provinces of medieval Denmark.[1]","image":"Royal_coat_of_arms_of_Denmark.svg.png.webp","url":"Monarchy_of_Denmark"}
