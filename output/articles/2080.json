This had the effect of deposing the descendants of Charles I (other than his Protestant granddaughter Princess (later Queen) Anne) as the next Protestant in line to the throne was the Electress Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James VI and I. After her, the crowns would descend only to her non-Catholic heirs.","image":"Coat_of_Arms_of_England_(1702-1707).svg.png.webp","url":"Act_of_Settlement_1701"}
