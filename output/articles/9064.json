{"title":"Centerfire ammunition","summary":"A centerfire cartridge is a firearm metallic cartridge whose primer is located at the center of the base of its casing (i.e. \"case head\").  Unlike rimfire cartridges, the centerfire primer is typically a separate component seated into a recessed cavity (known as the primer pocket) in the case head, and is replaceable by reloading.","image":"357_Magnum_01.jpg.webp"}
