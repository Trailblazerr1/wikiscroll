{"title":"Precision Time Protocol","summary":"The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network. On a local area network, it achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond range, making it suitable for measurement and control systems.[1] PTP is currently employed to synchronize financial transactions, mobile phone tower transmissions, sub-sea acoustic arrays, and networks that require precise timing but lack access to satellite navigation signals.","image":"65658b7b223af9e1acc877d848888ecdb4466560.svg","url":"Precision_Time_Protocol"}
