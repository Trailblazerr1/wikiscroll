{"title":"Disulfide","summary":"In biochemistry, a disulfide refers to a functional group with the structure R−S−S−R′. The linkage is also called an SS-bond or sometimes a disulfide bridge and is usually derived by the coupling of two thiol groups. In biology, disulfide bridges formed between thiol groups in two cysteine residues are an important component of the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins. Persulfide usually refers to R−S−S−H compounds.","image":"Pyrite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png.webp"}
