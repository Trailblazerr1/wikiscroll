{"title":"Nernst equation","summary":"In electrochemistry, the Nernst equation is a  chemical thermodynamical relationship allowing to calculate the reduction potential of a  reaction (half-cell or full cell reaction) from the standard electrode potential, absolute temperature, the number of electrons involved in the oxydo-reduction reaction, and activities (often approximated by concentrations) of the chemical species undergoing reduction and oxidation respectively. It was named after  Walther Nernst, a German physical chemist who formulated the equation.[1][2]","image":"59ed999dc51d86c353f5c77be1376388e2fc6e27.svg"}
