{"title":"Romance languages","summary":"The Romance languages, less commonly Latin languages or Neo-Latin languages, are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the third and eighth centuries.[1] They are a subgroup of the Italic languages in the Indo-European language family. The six most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are Spanish (489 million), Portuguese (250 million), French (77 million), Italian (67 million), Romanian (24 million), and Catalan (4.1 million[2]). Italian is the closest national language to Latin, followed by Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, and the most divergent being French. Taking into account all the Romance languages, including national and regional languages, Sardinian and Italian are together the least differentiated from Latin, and Occitan is closer to Latin than French.[3][4][5] However, all Romance languages are closer to each other than to classical Latin.","image":"Detailed_SVG_map_of_the_Romance-speaking_world.svg.png.webp","url":"Romance_languages"}
