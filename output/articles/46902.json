{"title":"Urban legend","summary":"An urban legend or contemporary legend is a genre of folklore comprising stories circulated as true, especially as having happened to a \"friend of a friend\" or family member, often with horrifying or humorous elements. These legends can be entertaining, but often concern mysterious peril or troubling events, such as disappearances and strange objects. They may also be confirmation of moral standards, or reflect prejudices, or be a way to make sense of societal anxieties.[1]","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp"}
