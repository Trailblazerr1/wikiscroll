{"title":"Corpus callosum","summary":"The corpus callosum (Latin for \"tough body\"), also callosal commissure, is a wide, thick nerve tract, consisting of a flat bundle of commissural fibers, beneath the cerebral cortex in the brain. The corpus callosum is only found in placental mammals.[1]  It spans part of the longitudinal fissure, connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, enabling communication between them. It is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, about ten centimetres in length and consisting of 200â€“300 million axonal projections.[2][3]","image":"Gray733.png.webp"}
