{"title":"Gynoecium","summary":"Gynoecium (/ɡaɪˈniːsiəm/, from Ancient Greek γυνή (gyne, \"woman\") and οἶκος (oikos, \"house\")) is most commonly used as a collective term for the parts of a flower that produce ovules and ultimately develop into the fruit and seeds. The gynoecium is the innermost whorl of a flower; it consists of (one or more) pistils and is typically surrounded by the pollen-producing reproductive organs, the stamens, collectively called the androecium. The gynoecium is often referred to as the \"female\" portion of the flower, although rather than directly producing female gametes (i.e. egg cells), the gynoecium produces megaspores, each of which develops into a female gametophyte which then produces egg cells.","image":"Magnolia_wieseneri_-_labelled_gynoecium.jpg.webp"}
