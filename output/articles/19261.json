{"title":"h-index","summary":"The h-index is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of the publications, initially used for an individual scientist or scholar. The h-index correlates with obvious success indicators such as winning the Nobel Prize, being accepted for research fellowships and holding positions at top universities.[1] The index is based on the set of the scientist's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other  publications. The index has more recently been applied to the productivity and impact of a scholarly journal[2] as well as a group of scientists, such as a department or university or country.[3] The index was suggested in 2005 by Jorge E. Hirsch, a physicist at UC San Diego, as a tool for determining theoretical physicists' relative quality[4] and is sometimes called the Hirsch index or Hirsch number.","image":"lossy-page1-100px-Locations_of_papers_in_a_map_of_science_and_locations_of_the_key_papers_for_Nobel_prizes.tif.jpg.webp"}
