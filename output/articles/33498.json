{"title":"Ovi (Nokia)","summary":"Ovi by Nokia (Finnish: ovi, lit.â€‰'door'[1]) was the brand for Nokia's Internet services. The Ovi services could be used from a mobile device, computer (through Ovi Suite) or via the web. Nokia focused on five key service areas: Games, Maps, Media, Messaging and Music. Nokia's aim with Ovi was to include third party developers, such as operators and third-party services like Yahoo's Flickr photo site. With the announcement of Ovi Maps Player API, Nokia started to evolve their services into a platform, enabling third parties to make use of Nokia's Ovi services.[2]","image":"Nokia-Ovi-logo.png.webp","url":"Ovi_(Nokia)"}
