{"title":"Polycarbonate","summary":"Polycarbonates (PC) are a group of thermoplastic polymers containing carbonate groups in their chemical structures. Polycarbonates used in engineering are strong, tough materials, and some grades are optically transparent. They are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed.  Because of these properties, polycarbonates find many applications. Polycarbonates do not have a unique resin identification code (RIC) and are identified as \"Other\", 7 on the RIC list. Products made from polycarbonate can contain the precursor monomer bisphenol A (BPA).","image":"Lexan.svg.png.webp"}
