{"title":"Sodomy","summary":"Sodomy (/ˈsɒdəmi/) or buggery (British English) is generally anal or oral sex between people, or sexual activity between a person and a non-human animal (bestiality), but it may also mean any non-procreative sexual activity.[1][2][3][4] Originally, the term sodomy, which is derived from the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Book of Genesis,[5][6] was commonly restricted to anal sex.[7][8] Sodomy laws in many countries criminalized the behavior.[8] In the Western world, many of these laws have been overturned or are routinely not enforced.[9]","image":"Sodoma_-_Elluin.jpg.webp"}
