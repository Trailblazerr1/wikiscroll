{"title":"2 Pallas","summary":"Pallas (minor-planet designation: 2 Pallas) is the second asteroid to have been discovered, after 1 Ceres. Like Ceres, it is believed to have a mineral composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, though significantly less hydrated than Ceres. It is the third-largest asteroid in the Solar System by both volume and mass, and is a likely remnant protoplanet. It is 79% the mass of 4 Vesta and 22% the mass of Ceres, constituting an estimated 7% of the mass of the asteroid belt. Its estimated volume is equivalent to a sphere 505 to 520 kilometers (314 to 323 mi) in diameter, 90–96% the volume of Vesta.","image":"Pallas_symbol_(fixed_width).svg.png.webp","url":"2_Pallas"}
