{"title":"Thomas Hutchinson (governor)","summary":"Thomas Hutchinson (9 September 1711 â€“ 3 June 1780) was a businessman, historian, and a prominent Loyalist politician of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the years before the American Revolution. He has been referred to as \"the most important figure on the loyalist side in pre-Revolutionary Massachusetts\".[1]   He was a successful merchant and politician, and was active at high levels of the Massachusetts government for many years, serving as lieutenant governor and then governor from 1758 to 1774.  He was a politically polarizing figure who came to be identified by John Adams and Samuel Adams as a proponent of hated British taxes, despite his initial opposition to Parliamentary tax laws directed at the colonies. He was blamed by Lord North (the British Prime Minister at the time) for being a significant contributor to the tensions that led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.[2]","image":"ThomasHutchinsonByEdwardTruman.jpg.webp","url":"Thomas_Hutchinson_(governor)"}
