{"title":"Centipede","summary":"Centipedes (from the New Latin prefix centi-, \"hundred\", and the Latin word pes, pedis, \"foot\") are predatory arthropods belonging to the class Chilopoda (Ancient Greek χεῖλος,  kheilos, lip, and New Latin suffix -poda, \"foot\", describing the forcipules) of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group which also includes millipedes and other multi-legged creatures. Centipedes are elongated metameric creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. Most centipedes are venomous and can inflict painful bites, injecting their venom through pincer-like appendages known as forcipules. Despite the name, centipedes can have a varying number of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes always have an odd number of pairs of legs.[1][2][3] Therefore, no centipede has exactly 100 legs. Like spiders and scorpions, centipedes are  predominantly carnivorous.[4]: 168","image":"Lithobius_forficatus.jpg.webp","url":"Centipede"}
