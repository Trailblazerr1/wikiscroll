{"title":"Early European modern humans","summary":"Early European modern humans (EEMH) or Cro-Magnons were the first early modern humans (Homo sapiens) to settle in Europe, continuously occupying the continent possibly from as early as 48,000 years ago. They interacted and interbred with the indigenous Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis), who went extinct 40 to 35 thousand years ago; and from 37,000 years ago onwards, all EEMH descended from a single founder population which contributes ancestry to present-day Europeans. EEMH produced Upper Palaeolithic cultures, the first major one being the Aurignacian, which was succeeded by the Gravettian by 30,000 years ago. The Gravettian split into the Epi-Gravettian in the east and Solutrean in the west, due to major climate degradation during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), peaking 21,000 years ago. As Europe warmed, the Solutrean evolved into the Magdalenian by 20,000 years ago, and these peoples recolonised Europe. The Magdalenian and Epi-Gravettian gave way to Mesolithic cultures as big game animals were dying out and the Last Glacial Period drew to a close.","image":"Side_view_of_the_skull_of_Old_man_of_Cros-Magnon._Wellcome_M0001124.jpg.webp"}
