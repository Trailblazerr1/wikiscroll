{"title":"Acid–base reaction","summary":"An acid–base reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base. It can be used to determine pH. Several theoretical frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the acid–base theories, for example, Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory.","image":"Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png.webp","url":"Acid–base_reaction"}
