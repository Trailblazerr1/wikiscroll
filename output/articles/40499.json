{"title":"Short-term memory","summary":"Short-term memory  (or \"primary\" or \"active memory\") is the capacity for holding, but not manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of time. For example, short-term memory can be used to remember a phone number that has just been recited. The duration of short-term memory (when rehearsal or active maintenance is prevented) is believed to be in the order of seconds. A commonly cited capacity of items to remember is The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two (also called Miller's Law, despite Miller calling the figure \"little more than a joke\" (Miller, 1989, page 401)). Cowan (2001) suggests that a more realistic figure is 4Â±1 items. In contrast, long-term memory holds information indefinitely.","image":"Psi2.svg.png.webp","url":"Short-term_memory"}
