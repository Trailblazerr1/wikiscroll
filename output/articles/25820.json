{"title":"Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease","summary":"Legg–Calvé–Perthes disease (LCPD), is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the head of the femur. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing.  Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head.","image":"Roe-perthes.jpg.webp"}
