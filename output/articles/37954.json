{"title":"Riemann sphere","summary":"In mathematics, the Riemann sphere, named after Bernhard Riemann,[1] is a model of the extended complex plane, the complex plane plus a point at infinity. This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, that is, the complex numbers plus a value ∞ for infinity. With the Riemann model, the point \"∞\" is near to very large numbers, just as the point \"0\" is near to very small numbers.","image":"RiemannKugel.svg.png.webp","url":"Riemann_sphere"}
