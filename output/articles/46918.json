{"title":"Urim and Thummim","summary":"In the Hebrew Bible, the Urim and the Thummim (Hebrew: הָאוּרִים וְהַתֻּמִּים‎, Modern: ha-Urim veha-Tummim Tiberian: hāʾÛrîm wəhatTummîm; meaning uncertain, possibly \"Lights and Perfections\") are elements of the hoshen, the breastplate worn by the High Priest attached to the ephod. They are connected with divination in general, and cleromancy in particular. Most scholars suspect that the phrase refers to a set of two objects used by the high priest to answer a question or reveal the will of God.[1][2]","image":"Menora.svg.png.webp"}
