{"title":"Cofactor (biochemistry)","summary":"A cofactor is a non-protein chemical compound or metallic ion that is required for an enzyme's role as a catalyst (a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction). Cofactors can be considered \"helper molecules\" that assist in biochemical transformations. The rates at which these happen are characterized in an area of study called enzyme kinetics. Cofactors typically differ from ligands in that they often derive their function by remaining bound.","image":"Succinate_Dehydrogenase_1YQ3_Electron_Carriers_Labeled.png.webp"}
