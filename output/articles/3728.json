{"title":"Animal Boy","summary":"Animal Boy is the ninth studio album by American punk band Ramones, released through Sire Records on May 19, 1986. Due to conflicts within the group, the album features less of lead singer Joey Ramone, both in performing and writing, and less performing from guitarist Johnny Ramone. Bassist Dee Dee Ramone wrote and sang more on this album than on previous albums, and Richie Ramone became the first drummer to write songs for the band since Tommy Ramone, the band's original drummer. The album spawned four singles, all of which charted on the UK Singles Chart, as well as other charts. In addition to singles, the band promoted their album using a music video for \"Something to Believe In\", which parodied the contemporary benefit concerts Live Aid and Hands Across America.","image":"Ramones_-_Animal_Boy_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Animal_Boy"}
