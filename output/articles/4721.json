{"title":"Astigmatism","summary":"Astigmatism is a type of refractive error due to rotational asymmetry in the eye's refractive power.  This results in distorted or blurred vision at any distance.[1] Other symptoms can include eyestrain, headaches, and trouble driving at night.[1] Astigmatism often occurs at birth and can change or develop later in life.[5] If it occurs in early life and is left untreated, it can result in amblyopia.[2]","image":"Astigmatism_text_blur.png.webp"}
