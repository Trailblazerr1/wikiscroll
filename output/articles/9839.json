There are approximately 50,000 Christadelphians in around 120 countries.[1] The movement developed in the United Kingdom and North America in the 19th century around the teachings of John Thomas, who coined the name Christadelphian[2][3] from the Greek words for Christ (Christos) and brothers (adelphoi).[4][5][6]","image":"Christian_cross.svg.png.webp"}
