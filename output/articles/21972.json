{"title":"Information-theoretic security","summary":"Information-theoretic security is security of a cryptosystem which derives purely from information theory; the system cannot be broken even if the adversary has unlimited computing power. The cryptosystem is considered cryptoanalytically unbreakable if the adversary does not have enough information to break the encryption.","image":"eed3e3db6cc2028a183af948212ed2551d25c954.svg","url":"Information-theoretic_security"}
