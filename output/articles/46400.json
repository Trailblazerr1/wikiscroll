Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, the inventors of the ENIAC.  Design work was started by their company, Eckertâ€“Mauchly Computer Corporation (EMCC), and was completed after the company had been acquired by Remington Rand (which later became part of Sperry, now Unisys). In the years before successor models of the UNIVAC I appeared, the machine was simply known as \"the UNIVAC\".[2]","image":"Museum_of_Science%2C_Boston%2C_MA_-_IMG_3163.JPG.webp"}
