{"title":"Inductance","summary":"Inductance is the tendency of an electrical conductor to oppose a change in the electric current flowing through it.  The flow of electric current creates a magnetic field around the conductor. The field strength depends on the magnitude of the current, and follows any changes in current. From Faraday's law of induction, any change in magnetic field through a circuit induces an electromotive force (EMF) (voltage) in the conductors, a process known as electromagnetic induction. This induced voltage created by the changing current has the effect of opposing the change in current. This is stated by Lenz's law, and the voltage is called back EMF.","image":"VFPt_Solenoid_correct2.svg.png.webp"}
