{"title":"Ice core","summary":"An ice core is a core sample that is typically removed from an ice sheet or a high mountain glacier.  Since the ice forms from the incremental buildup of annual layers of snow, lower layers are older than upper, and an ice core contains ice formed over a range of years.  Cores are drilled with hand augers (for shallow holes) or powered drills; they can reach depths of over two miles (3.2Â km), and contain ice up to 800,000 years old.","image":"Icecore_4.jpg.webp","url":"Ice_core"}
