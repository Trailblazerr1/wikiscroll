{"title":"Irving Berlin","summary":"Irving Berlin (born Israel Beilin; Yiddish: ישראל ביילין‎;[1] May 11, 1888[2] – September 22, 1989) was a Russian American composer and lyricist, widely considered one of the greatest songwriters in history. His music forms a great part of the Great American Songbook. Born in Imperial Russia (in the area that is now Belarus), Berlin arrived in the United States at the age of five. He published his first song, \"Marie from Sunny Italy\", in 1907, receiving 33 cents for the publishing rights,[3]   and had his first major international hit, \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\", in 1911. He also was an owner of the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. For much of his career Berlin could not read sheet music, and was such a limited piano player that he could only play in the key of F-sharp; he used his custom piano equipped with a transposing lever when he needed to play in keys other than F-sharp.[4]","image":"Irving_Berlin_(1888-1989)_circa_1940.jpg.webp"}
