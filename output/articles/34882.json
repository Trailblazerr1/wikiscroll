{"title":"Photovoltaic power station","summary":"A photovoltaic power station, also known as a solar park, solar farm, or solar power plant is a large-scale grid-connected photovoltaic power system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.","image":"Energiepark_Lauingen_Gehrlicher_Solar_AG.JPG.webp","url":"Photovoltaic_power_station"}
