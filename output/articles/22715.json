He was the 6th Imam and founder of the Ja'fari school of jurisprudence according to Twelver and Isma'ili Shi'ites. He is also important to Sunnis as a teacher to the Sunni scholars Abu Hanifah and Malik ibn Anas (traditionally regarded as the founders of the Hanafi and Maliki schools of Sunni jurisprudence, respectively)[4] and as a transmitter of Sunni hadith.[2] Ja'far al-Sadiq also figures prominently in the initiatic chains of many Sufi orders.[5]","image":"Jafar_Sadik_Name_in_Arabic.gif"}
