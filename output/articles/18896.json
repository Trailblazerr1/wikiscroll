{"title":"Greek withdrawal from the eurozone","summary":"A Greek withdrawal from the eurozone was a hypothetical scenario under which Greece would withdraw from the Eurozone to deal with the now expired Greek government-debt crisis. This conjecture has been referred to as \"Grexit\", a portmanteau combining the English words \"Greek\" and \"exit\",[1][2][3][4][5][6] and which has been expressed in Greek as ελλέξοδος,[7] (from Ελλάς + έξοδος).  The term \"Graccident\" (accidental Grexit) was coined for the case that Greece exited the EU and the euro unintentionally. These terms first came into use in 2012 and have been revitalised at each of the bailouts made available to Greece since then.","image":"When_Greece_falls.jpg.webp"}
