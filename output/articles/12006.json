{"title":"Dana Scully","summary":"Dana Katherine Scully is a fictional character in the Fox science fiction-supernatural television series The X-Files, played by Gillian Anderson. Scully is an FBI agent and a medical doctor (M.D.), partnered with fellow Special Agent Fox Mulder for seasons one to seven and seasons ten and eleven,  and with John Doggett in the eighth and ninth seasons. In the television series, they work out of a cramped basement office at FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C. to investigate unsolved cases labeled \"X-Files\". In 2002, Scully left government employment, and in 2008 she began working as a surgeon in Our Lady of Sorrows, a private Catholic hospital â€“ where she stayed for seven years, until rejoining the FBI. In contrast to Mulder's credulous \"believer\" character, Scully is the skeptic for the first seven seasons, choosing to base her beliefs on what science can prove. She later on becomes a \"believer\" after Mulder's abduction at the end of season seven.","image":"Scully2016.png.webp"}
