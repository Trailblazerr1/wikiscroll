{"title":"Endotherm","summary":"An endotherm (from Greek ἔνδον endon \"within\" and θέρμη thermē \"heat\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by  the use of heat released by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals.  Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic.","image":"Wiki_ostrich.jpg.webp","url":"Endotherm"}
