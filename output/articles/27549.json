{"title":"Lucian","summary":"Lucian of Samosata[lower-alpha 1] (Ancient Greek: Λουκιανός ό Σαμοσατεύς), (c. 125 – after 180) was an ancient Greek satirist, rhetorician and pamphleteer[1] who is best known for his characteristic tongue-in-cheek style, with which he frequently ridiculed superstition, religious practices, and belief in the paranormal. All of his extant works are written entirely in ancient Greek (mostly in the Attic Greek dialect popular during the Second Sophistic period).","image":"Lukian_von_Samosata_Opera.jpg.webp"}
