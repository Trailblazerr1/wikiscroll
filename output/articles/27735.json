{"title":"M-theory","summary":"M-theory is a theory in physics that unifies all consistent versions of superstring theory. Edward Witten first conjectured the existence of such a theory at a string-theory conference at the University of Southern California in the spring of 1995. Witten's announcement initiated a flurry of research activity known as the second superstring revolution.","image":"Calabi_yau_formatted.svg.png.webp","url":"M-theory"}
