{"title":"Open society","summary":"Open society (French: société ouverte) is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in 1932[1][2] and describes a dynamic system inclined to moral universalism.[3] Bergson contrasted an open society with what he called a closed society, a closed system of law, morality or religion. It is static, like a closed mind.[3] Bergson suggests that if all traces of civilization were to disappear, the instincts of the closed society for including or excluding others would remain.[4]","image":"Yellow_flag_waving.svg.png.webp"}
