{"title":"Fancy rat","summary":"The fancy rat (Rattus norvegicus domestica) is the domesticated form of Rattus norvegicus, the brown rat,[1] and the most common species of rat kept as a pet. The name fancy rat derives from the idea of animal fancy (the promotion of domesticated animals) or the phrase \"to fancy\" (meaning to like or appreciate).[2]  Wild-caught specimens that become docile and are bred for many generations still fall under the fancy type.","image":"Ratte-Vache.jpeg.webp"}
