{"title":"2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum","summary":"The United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, commonly referred to as the EU referendum or the Brexit referendum, took place on 23 June 2016 in the United Kingdom (UK) and Gibraltar to ask the electorate whether the country should remain a member of, or leave, the European Union (EU). The result would then be facilitated through the European Union Referendum Act 2015 and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The referendum resulted in 51.9% of the votes cast being in favour of leaving the EU. Although the referendum was legally non-binding, the government of the time promised to implement the result.[3] Parliament gave legal effect to the referendum by passing the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017 and on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom gave formal notice of intent to withdraw from the EU.","image":"United_Kingdom_EU_referendum_2016_area_results.svg.png.webp","url":"2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum"}
