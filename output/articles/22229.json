{"title":"International status and usage of the euro","summary":"The international status and usage of the euro has grown since its launch in 1999. When the euro formally replaced 12Â currencies on 1 January 2002, it inherited their use in territories such as Montenegro and replaced minor currencies tied to the pre-euro currencies, such as in Monaco. Four small states have been given a formal right to use the euro, and to mint their own coins, but all other usage outside the eurozone (the EU states who have adopted the euro) has been unofficial. With or without an agreement, these countries, unlike those in the eurozone, do not participate in the European Central Bank or the Eurogroup.","image":"DOLLAR_AND_EURO_IN_THE_WORLD.svg.png.webp"}
