{"title":"Electromagnetism","summary":"Electromagnetism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force, a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles. The electromagnetic force is carried by electromagnetic fields composed of electric fields and magnetic fields, and it is responsible for electromagnetic radiation such as light.  It is one of the four fundamental interactions (commonly called forces) in nature, together with the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and gravitation.[1] At high energy, the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single electroweak force.","image":"Lightning.0257.jpg.webp","url":"Electromagnetism"}
