{"title":"Regine Velasquez","summary":"Regina Encarnacion Ansong Velasquez  (/rɪˈdʒɪn vəˈlæskɛz/ rih-JEEN veh-LAS-kez; born April 22, 1970) is a Filipino singer, actress, and producer. She is known for her vocal range and belting technique, and notably for the unorthodox voice training she received during her childhood, a method where she was immersed neck-deep at sea. Velasquez rose to prominence after winning the television talent show Ang Bagong Kampeon in 1984 and the Asia Pacific Singing Contest in 1989. Under the name Chona, she signed a recording contract with OctoArts International in 1986 and released the single \"Love Me Again\", which was commercially unsuccessful. The following year, she adopted the stage name Regine Velasquez for her debut studio album, Regine (1987), under the guidance of Viva Records executive Vic del Rosario and producer Ronnie Henares. She explored Manila sound and kundiman on her second and third studio albums, Nineteen 90 (1990) and Tagala Talaga (1991).","image":"Luna_Awards_red_carpet_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Regine_Velasquez"}
