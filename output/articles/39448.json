{"title":"Sasanian Empire","summary":"The Sasanian (/səˈsɑːniən, səˈseɪniən/) or Sassanid Empire, officially known as the Empire of Iranians (Middle Persian: 𐭠𐭩𐭥𐭠𐭭𐭱𐭲𐭥𐭩, Ērānshahr),[lower-alpha 1] and also called the Neo-Persian Empire by historians,[9] was the last Persian imperial dynasty before the Muslim conquest in the mid-7th century AD. Named after the House of Sasan, it endured for over four centuries, from 224 to 651 AD, making it the longest-lived Persian dynasty.[2][10] The Sasanian Empire succeeded the Parthian Empire, and re-established the Iranians as a major power in late antiquity alongside its neighbouring arch-rival, the Roman-Byzantine Empire.[11][12][13]","image":"Derafsh_Kaviani_flag_of_the_late_Sassanid_Empire.svg.png.webp"}
