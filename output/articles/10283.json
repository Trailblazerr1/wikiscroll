{"title":"Climate variability and change","summary":"Climate variability includes all the variations in the climate that last longer than individual weather events, whereas the term climate change only refers to those variations that persist for a longer period of time, typically decades or more.  In addition to the general meaning in which \"climate change\" may refer to any time in Earth's history, the term is commonly used to describe the current climate change now underway.  In the time since the Industrial Revolution, the climate has increasingly been affected by human activities that are causing global warming and climate change.[1]","image":"ShipTracks_MODIS_2005may11.jpg.webp"}
