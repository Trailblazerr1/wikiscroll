{"title":"Ancient higher-learning institutions","summary":"A variety of ancient higher-learning institutions were developed in many cultures to provide institutional frameworks for scholarly activities. These ancient centres were sponsored and overseen by courts; by religious institutions, which sponsored cathedral schools, monastic schools, and madrasas; by scientific institutions, such as museums, hospitals, and observatories; and by respective scholars.  They are to be distinguished from the Western-style university, an autonomous organization of scholars that originated in medieval Europe[1] and has been adopted in other regions in modern times (see list of oldest universities in continuous operation).[2]","image":"MANNapoli_124545_plato's_academy_mosaic_enh_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Ancient_higher-learning_institutions"}
