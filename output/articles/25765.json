{"title":"Lecithin","summary":"Lecithin (/ˈlɛsɪθɪn, ˈlɛsəθ-/, from the Greek lekithos \"yolk\") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials.[1][2]","image":"1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine_Structural_Formulae_V.1.png.webp"}
