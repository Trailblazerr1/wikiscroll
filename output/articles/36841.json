{"title":"RBMK","summary":"The RBMK (Russian: реактор большой мощности канальный, РБМК; reaktor bolshoy moshchnosti kanalnyy, \"high-power channel-type reactor\") is a class of graphite-moderated nuclear power reactor designed and built by the Soviet Union. The name refers to its unusual design where, instead of a large steel pressure vessel surrounding the entire core, the core is surrounded by a cylindrical annular steel tank inside a concrete vault and each fuel assembly is enclosed in an individual 8 cm diameter pipe (called a \"channel\") surrounded in graphite (which is in turn surrounded by the tank) which allows the flow of cooling water around the fuel.","image":"Smolensk_Nuclear_Power_Plant.jpg.webp","url":"RBMK"}
