{"title":"Deep brain stimulation","summary":"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure involving the placement of a medical device called a neurostimulator (sometimes referred to as a \"brain pacemaker\"), which sends electrical impulses, through implanted electrodes, to specific targets in the brain (brain nuclei) for the treatment of movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia,[1] and other conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and epilepsy. While its underlying principles and mechanisms are not fully understood, DBS directly changes brain activity in a controlled manner.[2][3]","image":"Tiefe_Hirnstimulation_-_Sonden_RoeSchaedel_ap.jpg.webp"}
