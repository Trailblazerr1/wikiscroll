{"title":"Event of Ghadir Khumm","summary":"The event of Ghadir Khumm (Arabic: حَدِيْث ٱلْغَدِير‎; Persian: رویداد غدیر خم‎) refers to a sermon delivered by the Islamic prophet Muhammad at the pond of Khumm, shortly before his death in 11 AH (632 CE). According to Shia Islam, Muhammad announced Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor in this sermon.[3][4] Ali, who was Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law, occupies a similar position in Islam that Aaron does in Judaism.[5][6][7] The anniversary of this day in the Islamic calendar (18 Dhu al-Hijjah) is celebrated by Shia Muslims as Eid al-Ghadir.","image":"Ghadir_Khumm_et_sa_signification.jpg.webp","url":"Event_of_Ghadir_Khumm"}
