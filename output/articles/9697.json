{"title":"Chinese economic reform","summary":"The Chinese economic reform or reform and opening-up, known in the West as the opening of China, is the program of economic reforms termed \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\" and \"socialist market economy\" in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Led by Deng Xiaoping, often credited as the \"General Architect\", the reforms were launched by reformists within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) on December 18, 1978, during the \"Boluan Fanzheng\" period.[1][2][3][4] The reforms went into stagnation after the military crackdown on 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, but were revived after Deng Xiaoping's Southern Tour in 1992. In 2010, China overtook Japan as the world's second-largest economy.[5][6]","image":"National_Emblem_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China_(2).svg.png.webp"}
