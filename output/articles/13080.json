{"title":"Dire wolf","summary":"The dire wolf (Aenocyon dirus[10] /iːˈnɒsaɪ.ɒn ˈdaɪrəs/) is an extinct canine. It is one of the most famous prehistoric carnivores in North America, along with its extinct competitor Smilodon. The dire wolf lived in the Americas and eastern Asia during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene epochs (125,000–9,500 years ago). The species was named in 1858, four years after the first specimen had been found. Two subspecies are recognized: Aenocyon dirus guildayi and Aenocyon dirus dirus. The largest collection of its fossils has been obtained from the Rancho La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles.","image":"Canis_dirus_Sternberg_Museum.jpg.webp","url":"Dire_wolf"}
