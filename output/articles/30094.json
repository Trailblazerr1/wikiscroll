{"title":"Miranda warning","summary":"In the United States, the Miranda warning is a type of notification customarily given by police to criminal suspects in police custody (or in a custodial interrogation) advising them of their right to silence; that is, their right to refuse to answer questions or provide information to law enforcement or other officials. These rights are often referred to as Miranda rights. The purpose of such notification is to preserve the admissibility of their statements made during custodial interrogation in later criminal proceedings.","image":"Chief_Justice_Earl_Warren_-_Miranda_v._Arizona_(1966).jpg.webp"}
