{"title":"Dirac delta function","summary":"In mathematics, the Dirac delta function (Î´ function), also known as the unit impulse symbol,[1] is a generalized function or distribution over the real numbers, whose value is zero everywhere except at zero, and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one.[2][3][4] This is obviously impossible, so the basic idea to be reformulated quite fast.","image":"Navier_Stokes_Laminar.svg.png.webp"}
