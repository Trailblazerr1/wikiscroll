{"title":"Castell","summary":"A castell (Catalan pronunciation: [kəsˈteʎ]) is a human tower built traditionally at festivals in Catalonia, the Balearic islands and the Valencian Community. At these festivals, several colles castelleres (teams that build towers) attempt to build and dismantle a tower's structure. On 16 November 2010, castells were declared by UNESCO to be amongst the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.[1]","image":"Colla_Vella_dels_Xiquets_de_Valls_-_Primer_2de9_amb_folre_i_manilles_descarregat_de_la_història_-_Diada_de_Santa_Úrsula_1994.jpg.webp","url":"Castell"}
