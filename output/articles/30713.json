{"title":"Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation","summary":"Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, a form of artificial ventilation, is the act of assisting or stimulating respiration in which a rescuer presses their mouth against that of the victim and blows air into the person's lungs.[1][2] Artificial respiration takes many forms, but generally entails providing air for a person who is not breathing or is not making sufficient respiratory effort on their own.[3] It is used on a patient with a beating heart or as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to achieve the internal respiration.","image":"Insulfation2.jpg.webp","url":"Mouth-to-mouth_resuscitation"}
