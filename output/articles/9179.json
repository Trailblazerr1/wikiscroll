{"title":"Chain rule","summary":"In calculus, the chain rule is a formula that expresses the derivative of the composition of two differentiable functions f and g in terms of the derivatives f and g. More precisely, if \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        =\n        f\n        âˆ˜\n        g\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h=f\\circ g}\n  \n is the function such that \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h(x)=f(g(x))}\n  \n for every x, then the chain rule is, in Lagrange's notation,","image":"a14345f3938c66b1fde08e18d8b301a59c5775a5.svg"}
