{"title":"Yoga pants","summary":"Yoga pants are high-denier hosiery reaching from ankle to waist, originally designed for yoga as exercise and first sold in 1998 by Lululemon, a company founded for that purpose. They were initially made of a mix of nylon and Lycra; more specialised fabrics have been introduced to provide moisture-wicking, compression, and odour reduction.","image":"Wunder_Groove_Crop.jpg.webp","url":"Yoga_pants"}
