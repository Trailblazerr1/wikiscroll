{"title":"John Tyler","summary":"John Tyler (March 29, 1790 – January 18, 1862) was the 10th president of the United States, serving from 1841 to 1845, after briefly holding office as the 10th vice president in 1841. He was elected vice president on the 1840 Whig ticket with President William Henry Harrison, succeeding to the presidency after Harrison's death 31 days after assuming office. Tyler was a stalwart supporter and advocate of states' rights, including regarding slavery, and he adopted nationalistic policies as president only when they did not infringe on the powers of the states. His unexpected rise to the presidency posed a threat to the presidential ambitions of Henry Clay and other Whig politicians, and left Tyler estranged from the nation's both major political parties at the time.","image":"John_Tyler_(cropped_3x4).png.webp"}
