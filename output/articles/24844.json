{"title":"Kingdom of Aksum","summary":"The Kingdom of Aksum (Ge'ez: መንግሥተ አኵስም), also known as the Kingdom of Axum or the Aksumite Empire, was an ancient kingdom, from the 2nd to the 10th century, with its capital at the city of Axum (Aksum).[3] The kingdom was centered in what is now northern Ethiopia, and spanned across modern-day Eritrea, eastern Sudan and Yemen at its height during the reign of Kaleb of Axum.[4] Emerging from the earlier Dʿmt civilization, the kingdom was likely founded in the early 1st century.[5] Pre-Aksumite culture developed in part due to a South Arabian influence, evident in the Aksumite use of Ancient South Arabian script and the practice of Ancient Semitic religion.[6] However, the Geʽez script came into use by the 4th century, and as the kingdom became a major power on the trade route between Rome and India, it entered the Greco-Roman cultural sphere and began to use Greek as a lingua franca.[7] It is through this that the Kingdom of Aksum adopted Christianity as the state religion in the mid-4th century under Ezana of Axum.[8] Following their Christianization, the Aksumites ceased construction of stelae.[4]","image":"Endubis.jpg.webp"}
