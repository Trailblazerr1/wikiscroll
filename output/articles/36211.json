{"title":"Progressive Era","summary":"The  Progressive Era (1896â€“1916) was  a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States of America that spanned the 1890s to World War I.[1] Progressive reformers were typically middle-class society women or Christian ministers. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were addressing problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and political corruption. Social reformers were primarily middle-class citizens who targeted political machines and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office, a further means of direct democracy would be established. They also sought regulation of monopolies through methods such as trustbusting and corporations through antitrust laws, which were seen as a way to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitors. They also advocated for new government roles and regulations, and new agencies to carry out those roles, such as the FDA.","image":"Henry_Mayer%2C_The_Awakening%2C_1915_Cornell_CUL_PJM_1176_01_-_Restoration.jpg.webp"}
