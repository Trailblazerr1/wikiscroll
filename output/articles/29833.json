{"title":"Middle Paleolithic","summary":"The Middle Paleolithic (or Middle Palaeolithic) is the second subdivision of the Paleolithic  or Old Stone Age  as it is understood in Europe, Africa and Asia. The term Middle Stone Age is used as an equivalent or a synonym for the Middle Paleolithic in African archeology.[1] The Middle Paleolithic broadly spanned from 300,000 to 30,000 years ago. There are considerable dating differences between regions. The Middle Paleolithic was succeeded by the Upper Paleolithic subdivision which first began between 50,000 and  40,000 years ago.[1] Pettit and White date the Early Middle Paleolithic in Great Britain to about 325,000 to 180,000 years ago (late Marine Isotope Stage 9 to late Marine Isotope Stage 7), and the Late Middle Paleolithic as about 60,000 to 35,000 years ago.[2]","image":"Wikiartifact-page-001.jpg.webp","url":"Middle_Paleolithic"}
