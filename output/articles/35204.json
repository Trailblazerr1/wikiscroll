{"title":"Plate tectonics","summary":"Plate tectonics (from the Late Latin: tectonicus, from the Ancient Greek: τεκτονικός, lit. 'pertaining to building')[1] is the generally accepted scientific theory that considers the Earth's lithosphere to comprise a number of large of tectonic plates which have been slowly moving since about 3.4 billion years ago.[2] The model builds on the concept of continental drift, an idea developed during the first decades of the 20th century. Plate-tectonics came to be generally accepted by geoscientists  after seafloor spreading was validated in the mid to late 1960s.","image":"Plates_tect2_en.svg.png.webp"}
