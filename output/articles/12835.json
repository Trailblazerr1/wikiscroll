{"title":"Diacritic","summary":"A diacritic (also diacritical mark, diacritical point, diacritical sign, or accent) is a glyph added to a letter or to a basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek διακριτικός (diakritikós, \"distinguishing\"), from διακρίνω (diakrī́nō, \"to distinguish\"). The word diacritic is a noun, though it is sometimes used in an attributive sense, whereas diacritical is only an adjective. Some diacritics, such as the acute (◌́  ) and grave (◌̀  ), are often called accents. Diacritics may appear above or below a letter or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.","image":"Example_of_biblical_Hebrew_trope.svg.png.webp"}
