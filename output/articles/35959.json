{"title":"Presumption of innocence","summary":"The presumption of innocence is a legal principle that every person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty.  Under the presumption of innocence, the legal burden of proof is thus on the prosecution, which must present compelling evidence to the trier of fact (a judge or a jury).  If the prosecution does not prove the charges true, then the person is acquitted of the charges.  The prosecution must in most cases prove that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If reasonable doubt remains, the accused must be acquitted.  The opposite system is a presumption of guilt.","image":"Johnny-automatic-scales-of-justice.svg.png.webp","url":"Presumption_of_innocence"}
