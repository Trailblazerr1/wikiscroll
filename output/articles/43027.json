{"title":"Swimming","summary":"Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, or a liquid substance, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.  Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs and the body. Humans can hold their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.[1]","image":"Natacio.jpg.webp"}
