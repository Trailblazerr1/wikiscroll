{"title":"Albanians","summary":"The Albanians (/ælˈbɛɪniənz/; Albanian: Shqiptarët pronounced [ʃcipˈtaɾət]) are an ethnic group native to the Balkan Peninsula and are identified by a common Albanian ancestry, culture, history and language.[64] They primarily live in Albania, Kosovo,[lower-alpha 4] North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia as well as in Croatia, Greece, Italy and Turkey. They also constitute a large diaspora with several communities established across Europe, the Americas and Oceania. Diaspora based Albanians may self identify as Albanian, use hybrid identification or identify with their nationality, often creating an obstacle in establishing a total figure of the population.[65]","image":"Map_of_the_Albanian_Diaspora_in_the_World.svg.png.webp"}
