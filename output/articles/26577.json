{"title":"List of Olympic medalists in curling","summary":"Curling is a team sport that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's tournament was held at the 1924 Winter Olympics before the sport was removed from the official programme until the 1998 Games.[1] For 82Â years, the 1924 tournament was considered a demonstration sport, so the medals were not officially counted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).[2] The tournament was won by a team from the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland, who represented Great Britain.[3] In 2006, Scottish newspaper The Herald conducted an investigation that found evidence that curling had been part of the official programme.[4] The IOC subsequently recognized the top three teams as full medal winners.[5]","image":"Women's_curling_olympic_medalists_Vancouver_2010_P2260164.jpg.webp"}
