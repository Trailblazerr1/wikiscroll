{"title":"Blue plaque","summary":"A blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person, event, or former building on the site, serving as a historical marker. The term is used in the United Kingdom in two different senses. It may be used narrowly and specifically to refer to the \"official\" scheme administered by English Heritage, and currently restricted to sites within Greater London; or it may be used less formally to encompass a number of similar schemes administered by organisations throughout the UK.","image":"FREDDIE_MERCURY_(FRED_BULSARA)_1946-1991_Singer_and_Songwriter_lived_here.jpg.webp","url":"Blue_plaque"}
