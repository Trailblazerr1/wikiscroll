{"title":"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?","summary":"(What's the Story) Morning Glory? is the second studio album by English rock band Oasis. Released on 2 October 1995 by Creation Records, it was produced by Owen Morris and the group's guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous album Definitely Maybe (1994). Gallagher's compositions were more focused in balladry and placed more emphasis on \"huge\" choruses,[1] with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. Morning Glory was the group's first album with drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll (though McCarroll still appeared on the album, drumming on the track \"Some Might Say\").","image":"Oasis_-_(What's_The_Story)_Morning_Glory_album_cover.jpg.webp","url":"(What's_the_Story)_Morning_Glory?"}
