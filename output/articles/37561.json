{"title":"Religion in ancient Rome","summary":"Religion in ancient Rome includes the ethnic religion of Ancient Rome that the Romans used to define themselves as a people, as well as the religious practices of peoples brought under Roman rule, in so far as they became widely followed in Rome and Italy. The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety (pietas) in maintaining good relations with the gods. The Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists.[1]","image":"Roma%2C_Museo_Ara_Pacis_-_Calco_di_Roma_con_Vittoria_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall'Orto%2C_30-Mar-2008.jpg.webp","url":"Religion_in_ancient_Rome"}
