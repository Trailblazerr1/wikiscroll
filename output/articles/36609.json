{"title":"Pysanka","summary":"A pysanka (Ukrainian: писанка, plural: pysanky) is a Ukrainian Easter egg, decorated with traditional Ukrainian folk designs using a wax-resist method. The word pysanka comes from the verb pysaty, \"to write\" or \"to inscribe\", as the designs are not painted on, but written (inscribed) with beeswax.","image":"Pysanky2011.JPG.webp"}
