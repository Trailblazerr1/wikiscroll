{"title":"Choking","summary":"Choking occurs when breathing is impeded by a constricted or obstructed throat or windpipe.[1] In some cases, the airflow is completely blocked, and in other cases, insufficient air passes through to the lungs, resulting in oxygen deprivation. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops,[2] choking often leads to death. Choking was the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related deaths in the US in 2011.[3]","image":"Abdominal_thrusts3.jpg.webp","url":"Choking"}
