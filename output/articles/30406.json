{"title":"Monosaccharide","summary":"Monosaccharides (from Greek monos: single, sacchar: sugar), also called simple sugars, are the simplest form of sugar and the most basic units (monomers) of carbohydrates.[1]  The general formula is CnH2nOn, or [Cn(H2O)n] or { CH2O}n albeit not all molecules fitting this formula (e.g. acetic acid) are carbohydrates. [2] They are usually colorless, water-soluble, and crystalline solids. Contrary to their name (sugars), only some monosaccharides have a sweet taste.","image":"DL-Glucose.svg.png.webp","url":"Monosaccharide"}
