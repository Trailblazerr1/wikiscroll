{"title":"River Brue","summary":"The River Brue originates in the parish of Brewham in Somerset, England, and reaches the sea some 50 kilometres (31Â mi) west at Burnham-on-Sea. It originally took a different route from Glastonbury to the sea, but this was changed by Glastonbury Abbey in the twelfth century. The river provides an important drainage route for water from a low-lying area which is prone to flooding which man has tried to manage through rhynes, canals, artificial rivers and sluices for centuries.","image":"River_Brue_and_Glastonbury_Tor_-_geograph.org.uk_-_668519.jpg.webp","url":"River_Brue"}
