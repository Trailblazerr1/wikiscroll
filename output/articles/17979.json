{"title":"Get (divorce document)","summary":"A get or gett (/ɡɛt/; Hebrew: גט‎, plural gittin גטין) is a document in Jewish religious law which effectuates a divorce between a Jewish couple. The requirements for a get include that the document be presented by a husband to his wife. The essential part of the get is a very short declaration: \"You are hereby permitted to all men\". The effect of the get is to free the woman from the marriage, and consequently she is free to marry another and that the laws of adultery no longer apply. The get also returns to the wife the legal rights that a husband held in regard to her.","image":"Moshe_Rynecki-_Le_Get_(divorce).jpg.webp"}
