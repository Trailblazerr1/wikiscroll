{"title":"East Turkestan","summary":"East Turkestan (also spelled East Turkistan; Uighur: شەرقىي تۈركىستان, romanized: Sherqiy Türkistan, Шәрқий Түркистан;  Chinese: 东突厥斯坦) varies in meaning by context and usage. The term was coined in the 19th century by Russian Turkologists including Nikita Bichurin to replace another Western term, Chinese Turkestan, which referred to the Tarim Basin in the southwestern part of Xinjiang during the Qing Dynasty. The medieval Persian toponym \"Turkestan\" and its derivatives were not, however, used by the local population. The Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr, which means \"Six Cities\" in Uyghur. Besides, China had since the Han Dynasty had its own name for an overlapping area: the \"Western Regions\". The parts of this area controlled by China were termed \"Xinjiang\" starting in the 18th century.","image":"Kokbayraq_flag.svg.png.webp"}
