As head of state, the President represents Vietnam both domestically and internationally, and maintains the regular and coordinated operation and stability of the national government and safeguards the independence and territorial integrity of the country.","image":"Mr._Nguyen_Xuan_Phuc.jpg.webp","url":"President_of_Vietnam"}
