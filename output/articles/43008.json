{"title":"Swedish emigration to the United States","summary":"During the Swedish emigration to the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries, about 1.3Â million Swedes left Sweden for the United States of America. While the land of the U.S. frontier was a magnet for the rural poor all over Europe, some factors encouraged Swedish emigration in particular. The religious repression practiced by the Swedish Lutheran State Church was widely resented, as was the social conservatism and class snobbery of the Swedish monarchy. Population growth and crop failures made conditions in the Swedish countryside increasingly bleak. By contrast, reports from early Swedish emigrants painted the American Midwest as an earthly paradise, and praised American religious and political freedom and undreamed-of opportunities to better one's condition.","image":"Aquitaniaposter.PNG.webp","url":"Swedish_emigration_to_the_United_States"}
