{"title":"Dibatag","summary":"The dibatag (Ammodorcas clarkei),  or Clarke's gazelle, is a medium-sized slender antelope native to Ethiopia and Somalia.  Though not a true gazelle, it is similarly marked, with long legs and neck. It is often confused with the gerenuk due to their striking resemblance. The typical head-and-body length is about 103 to 117 cm (41 to 46 in). They stand up to about 80 to 90 cm (31 to 35 in). Male dibatag weigh between 20 and 35 kg (44 and 77 lb), whereas females range from 22 and 29 kg (49 and 64 lb). The length of the curved horns, present only on males, is typically between 10 and 25 cm (3.9 and 9.8 in). The upper parts are gray to fawn, while the dorsal and lateral areas are cinnamon to rufous (reddish brown). The underparts, rump and the insides of the legs are all white. While markings are visible on the face, there are none on the flanks or the buttocks.","image":"Ammodorcas_clarkei_The_book_of_antelopes_(1894).jpg.webp","url":"Dibatag"}
