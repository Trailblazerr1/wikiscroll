{"title":"Biogenesis","summary":"Biogenesis is the production of new living organisms. Conceptually, biogenesis is sometimes  attributed to Louis Pasteur and  encompasses the belief that complex living things come only from other living things, by means of reproduction. That is, life does not spontaneously arise from non-living material, which was the position held by spontaneous generation.[1] Pasteur's claim followed Virchow's doctrine Omnis cellula e cellula (all cells from cells),[2] itself derived from work of Robert Remak.[3]","image":"Pasteur's_experiment_testing_spontaneous_generation_and_biogenesis.gif","url":"Biogenesis"}
