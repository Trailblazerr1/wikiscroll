{"title":"British Isles","summary":"The British Isles are a group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean off the north-western coast of continental Europe, consisting of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Inner and Outer Hebrides and over six thousand smaller islands.[8] They have a total area of 315,159 km2 (121,684 sq mi)[5] and a combined population of almost 72 million, and include two sovereign states, the Republic of Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of Ireland),[9] and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Channel Islands, off the north coast of France, are sometimes taken to be part of the British Isles,[10] even though they do not form part of the archipelago.[11]","image":"MODIS_-_Great_Britain_and_Ireland_-_2012-06-04_during_heat_wave.jpg.webp"}
