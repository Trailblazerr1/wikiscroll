{"title":"Tao","summary":"Tao or Dao is the natural order of the universe whose character one's human intuition must discern in order to realize the potential for individual wisdom, as conceived in the context of East Asian philosophy, East Asian religions, or any other human thought that accords with them on this principle. This intuitive knowing of \"life\" cannot be grasped as a concept; it is known through actual living experience of one's everyday being. Its name, Tao or Dao (ChineseÂ ), came from Chinese, where it signifies the \"way\", \"path\", \"route\", \"road\" or sometimes more loosely \"doctrine\", \"principle\" or \"holistic beliefs\".[1]","image":"Tao.svg.png.webp","url":"Tao"}
