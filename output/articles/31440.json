{"title":"National park","summary":"A national park is a natural park in use for conservation purposes, created and protected by national governments. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride.[1]","image":"Bogdkhan_Uul_Strictly_Protected_Area%2C_Mongolia_(149199747).jpg.webp"}
