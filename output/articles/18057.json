{"title":"Giant planet","summary":"The giant planets constitute a diverse type of planet much larger than Earth. They are usually primarily composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter, but massive solid planets can also exist. There are four known giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.","image":"Jupiter_and_its_shrunken_Great_Red_Spot.jpg.webp","url":"Giant_planet"}
