As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an \"incorporated place\" includes a variety of designations, including city, town, village, borough, and municipality.[lower-alpha 1] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[lower-alpha 2] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only that portion (or \"balance\") of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.","image":"Pano_Manhattan2007_amk.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_United_States_cities_by_population"}
