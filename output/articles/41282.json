{"title":"Solid-state drive","summary":"A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage. It is also sometimes called a solid-state device or a solid-state disk,[1] even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable readâ€“write heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.[2]","image":"Super_Talent_2.5in_SATA_SSD_SAM64GM25S.jpg.webp"}
