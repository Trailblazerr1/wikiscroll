{"title":"List of Major League Baseball annual ERA leaders","summary":"In baseball, earned run average (ERA) is a statistic used to evaluate pitchers, calculated as the mean of earned runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings pitched.[a] A pitcher is assessed an earned run for each run scored by a baserunner who reached base while batting against that pitcher, whether by hit, base on balls or \"walk\", or being hit by a pitched ball;[1] an earned run can be charged after the pitcher is relieved if he allows the runner before leaving the game.[2] Runs scored by players who reach base on errors, passed balls, or catcher interference under special circumstances are treated as unearned runs, and do not count towards the pitcher's ERA.[2]","image":"Tommy_bond_baseball.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Major_League_Baseball_annual_ERA_leaders"}
