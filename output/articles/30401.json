{"title":"Monophyly","summary":"In cladistics for a group of organisms, monophyly is the condition of being a cladeâ€”that is, a group of taxa composed only of a common ancestor (or more precisely an ancestral population) and all of its lineal descendants. Monophyletic groups are typically characterised by shared derived characteristics (synapomorphies), which distinguish organisms in the clade from other organisms. An equivalent term is holophyly.[1]","image":"Clade-grade_II.png.webp","url":"Monophyly"}
