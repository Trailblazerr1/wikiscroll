{"title":"Tint, shade and tone","summary":"In color theory, a tint is a mixture of a color with white, which increases lightness, while a shade is a mixture with black, which increases darkness. Both processes affect the resulting color mixture's relative saturation. A tone is produced either by mixing a color with gray, or by both tinting and shading.[1] Mixing a color with any neutral color (including black, gray, and white) reduces the chroma, or colorfulness, while the hue (the relative mixture of red, green, blue, etc. depending on the colorspace) remains unchanged.","image":"Tint-tone-shade.svg.png.webp","url":"Tint,_shade_and_tone"}
