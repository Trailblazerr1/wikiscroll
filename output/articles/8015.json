{"title":"Bábism","summary":"Bábism, also known as the Bábi Faith[1] (Persian: بابیه‎, romanized: Babiyye), is a monotheistic religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God[2][3] who manifests his will in an unending series of theophanies, called Manifestation of God. It has no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of whom are concentrated in Iran.[4][5][6] It was founded by ʻAli Muhammad Shirazi who first assumed the title of Báb (lit. 'Gate') from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the Twelfth Imam.[7] However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the Báb progressively outlined his teachings.[8]","image":"Haykal2.gif","url":"Bábism"}
