{"title":"Snooker","summary":"Snooker (pronounced UK: /ˈsnuːkər/, US: /ˈsnʊkər/)[1][2] is a cue sport that was first played by British Army officers stationed in India in the second half of the 19th century. It is played on a rectangular table covered with a green cloth called baize, with six pockets: one at each corner and one in the middle of each long side. Using a cue stick, the individual players or teams take turns to strike the white cue ball to pot the other twenty-one snooker balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual frame of snooker is won by the player who has scored the most points. A snooker match ends with one of the players having won a predetermined number of frames.","image":"Snooker_table_selby.JPG.webp","url":"Snooker"}
