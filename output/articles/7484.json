{"title":"Bra–ket notation","summary":"In quantum mechanics, bra–ket notation, or Dirac notation, is used ubiquitously to denote quantum states. The notation uses angle brackets, \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟨\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\rangle }\n  \n, and a vertical bar \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle |}\n  \n, to construct \"bras\" and \"kets\".","image":"465059661f2295b855415c61124fb1a960e9e888.svg"}
