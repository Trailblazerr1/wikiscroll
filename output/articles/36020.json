{"title":"Prime Minister of Poland","summary":"The president of the Council of Ministers (Polish: Prezes Rady Ministrów), colloquially referred to as the prime minister, is the head of the cabinet and the head of government of Poland.[2] The current responsibilities and traditions of the office stem from the creation of the contemporary Polish state, and the office is defined in the Constitution of 1997. According to the Constitution, the president nominates and appoints the prime minister, who will then propose the composition of the Cabinet.[3] Fourteen days following their appointment, the prime minister must submit a programme outlining the government's agenda to the Sejm, requiring a vote of confidence.[4] Conflicts stemming from both interest and powers have arisen between the offices of President and Prime Minister in the past.","image":"Mateusz_Morawiecki_Prezes_Rady_Ministrów_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
