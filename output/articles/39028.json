{"title":"Saint Christopher","summary":"Saint Christopher (Greek: Ἅγιος Χριστόφορος, Ágios Christóforos) is venerated by several Christian denominations as a martyr killed in the reign of the 3rd-century Roman emperor Decius (reigned 249–251) or alternatively under the emperor Maximinus Daia (reigned 308–313). There appears to be confusion due to the similarity in names \"Decius\" and \"Daia\".[3] Churches and monasteries were named after him by the 7th century.","image":"Bosch65.jpg.webp"}
