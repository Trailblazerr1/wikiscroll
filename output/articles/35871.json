{"title":"Presidency of Donald Trump","summary":"Donald Trump's tenure as the 45th president of the United States began with his inauguration on January 20, 2017, and ended on January 20, 2021. Trump, a Republican originally from New York City, took office following his Electoral College victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, in which he did not win a plurality of the popular vote. Trump made an unprecedented number of false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. His presidency ended with his defeat in the 2020 presidential election by Democrat Joe Biden after one term in office. It was the first presidency since that of Herbert Hoover in which a president was not reelected and his party lost its majorities in both chambers of Congress.[1]","image":"Donald_Trump_official_portrait.jpg.webp","url":"Presidency_of_Donald_Trump"}
