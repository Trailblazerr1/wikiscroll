{"title":"Dornier Do 17","summary":"The Dornier Do 17, is a twin-engined light bomber produced by Dornier Flugzeugwerke for the German Luftwaffe during World War II. Designed in the early 1930s as a Schnellbomber (\"fast bomber\") intended to be fast enough to outrun opposing aircraft, the lightly built craft had a twin tail and \"shoulder wing\". Sometimes referred to as the Fliegender Bleistift (\"flying pencil\"), it was popular among its crews due to its handling, especially at low altitude, which made the Do 17 harder to hit than other German bombers.","image":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_101I-342-0603-25%2C_Belgien-Frankreich%2C_Flugzeuge_Dornier_Do_17.jpg.webp"}
