It is 10,677 km (6,634 mi) from Paris, France, 5,400 km (2,900 nmi) from Papeete, Tahiti, and 1,080 km (580 nmi) from Mexico. It is an overseas state private property of France, under direct authority of the Minister of the Overseas.[1][2] In the past, Clipperton Island was the subject of a sovereignty dispute in particular between France and Mexico, which was finally settled through arbitration in 1931; the Clipperton Island Case remains widely studied in international law textbooks.","image":"Ile_de_Clipperton_(carte-en).svg.png.webp","url":"A%2fClipperton_Island"}
