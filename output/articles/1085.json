During the second half of the first millennium Ceredigion was a minor kingdom.[4] It has been administered as a county since 1282. Ceredigion is considered a centre of Welsh culture and more than half the population can speak Welsh. The county is mainly rural with over 50 miles (80 km) of coastline and a mountainous hinterland. The numerous sandy beaches and the long-distance Ceredigion Coast Path provide excellent views of Cardigan Bay.","image":"Melindwr%2C_Eglwys_Fach_-_geograph.org.uk_-_646101.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fCeredigion"}
