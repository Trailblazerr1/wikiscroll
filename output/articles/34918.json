{"title":"Pi bond","summary":"In chemistry, pi bonds (Ï€ bonds) are covalent chemical bonds, in each of which two lobes of an orbital (on one atom) overlap with two lobes of an orbital on another atom, and in which this overlap occurs laterally. Each of these atomic orbitals has an electron density of zero at a shared nodal plane that passes through the two bonded nuclei. This plane also is a nodal plane for the molecular orbital of the pi bond. Pi bonds can form in double and triple bonds but do not form in single bonds in most cases.","image":"Pi-Bond.svg.png.webp"}
