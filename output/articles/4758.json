{"title":"Asynchronous Transfer Mode","summary":"Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a telecommunications standard defined by ANSI and ITU-T (formerly CCITT) for digital transmission of multiple types of traffic, including telephony (voice), data, and video signals in one network without the use of separate overlay networks.[1][2] ATM was developed to meet the needs of the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network, as defined in the late 1980s,[3] and designed to integrate telecommunication networks. It can handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic and real-time, low-latency content such as voice and video. ATM provides functionality that uses features of circuit switching and packet switching networks. It uses asynchronous time-division multiplexing.[4][5]","image":"IBM_Turboways_ATM_155.jpg.webp","url":"Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode"}
