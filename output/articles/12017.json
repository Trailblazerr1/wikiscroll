{"title":"Dandy–Walker malformation","summary":"Dandy–Walker malformation (DWM), also known as Dandy–Walker syndrome (DWS), is a rare congenital brain malformation in which the part joining the two hemispheres of the cerebellum (the cerebellar vermis) does not fully form, and the fourth ventricle and space behind the cerebellum (the posterior fossa) are enlarged with cerebrospinal fluid. Most of those affected develop hydrocephalus within the first year of life,[6] which can present as increasing head size, vomiting, excessive sleepiness, irritability, downward deviation of the eyes and seizures.[4] Other, less common symptoms are generally associated with comorbid genetic conditions and can include congenital heart defects, eye abnormalities, intellectual disability, congenital tumours, other brain defects such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, skeletal abnormalities, an occipital encephalocele or underdeveloped genitalia or kidneys.[5] It is sometimes discovered in adolescents or adults due to mental health problems.[5][6]","image":"Dandy-Walker-Variante_-_MRT_T2_sagittal.jpg.webp","url":"Dandy–Walker_malformation"}
