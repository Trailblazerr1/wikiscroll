{"title":"Murti","summary":"Murti (Sanskrit: मूर्ति, ISO: Mūrti; lit. 'form, embodiment, or solid object')[1] is a general term for an image, statue or idol of a deity or mortal in Hindu culture.[2] In Hindu temples, it is a symbolic icon. A murti is itself not a god in Hinduism,[3] but it is a shape, embodiment or manifestation of a deity.[4] Murti are also found in some nontheistic Jainism traditions, where they serve as symbols of revered mortals inside Jain temples, and are worshiped in murtipujaka rituals.[5][6]","image":"Sri_Parvati_Devi_(2).JPG.webp"}
