{"title":"Play (Moby album)","summary":"Play is the fifth studio album by American electronic musician Moby. It was released on May 17, 1999, through Mute Records internationally and V2 Records in North America. Recording of the album began in mid-1997, following the release of Moby's fourth album, Animal Rights (1996), which deviated from his electronica style; Moby's goal for Play was to return to this style of music. Originally intended to be his final record, the album was recorded at Moby's home studio in Manhattan, New York.","image":"Moby_play.JPG.webp","url":"Play_(Moby_album)"}
