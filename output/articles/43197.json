{"title":"T-tubule","summary":"T-tubules (transverse tubules) are extensions of the  cell membrane that penetrate into the centre of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells.   With membranes that contain large concentrations of ion channels, transporters, and pumps, T-tubules permit rapid transmission of the action potential into the cell, and also play an important role in regulating cellular calcium concentration.","image":"Blausen_0801_SkeletalMuscle.png.webp","url":"T-tubule"}
