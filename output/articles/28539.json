{"title":"Marine protected area","summary":"Marine protected areas (MPA) are protected areas of seas, oceans, estuaries or in the US, the Great Lakes.[1] These marine areas can come in many forms ranging from wildlife refuges to research facilities.[2] MPAs restrict human activity for a conservation purpose, typically to protect natural or cultural resources.[3] Such marine resources are protected by local, state, territorial, native, regional, national, or international authorities and differ substantially among and between nations. This variation includes different limitations on development, fishing practices, fishing seasons and catch limits, moorings and bans on removing or disrupting marine life. In some situations (such as with the Phoenix Islands Protected Area), MPAs also provide revenue for countries, potentially equal to the income that they would have if they were to grant companies permissions to fish.[4] The value of MPA to mobile species is unknown.[5]","image":"Milford_sound_2004.jpg.webp","url":"Marine_protected_area"}
