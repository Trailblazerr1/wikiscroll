{"title":"Ellipsis (linguistics)","summary":"In linguistics, ellipsis (from the Greek: ἔλλειψις, élleipsis, \"omission\") or an elliptical construction is the omission from a clause of one or more words that are nevertheless understood in the context of the remaining elements. There are numerous distinct types of ellipsis acknowledged in theoretical syntax. Theoretical accounts of ellipsis seek to explain its syntactic and semantic factors, the means by which the elided elements are recovered, and the status of the elided elements. Theoretical accounts of ellipsis can vary greatly depending in part upon whether a constituency-based or a dependency-based theory of syntactic structure is pursued.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Ellipsis_(linguistics)"}
