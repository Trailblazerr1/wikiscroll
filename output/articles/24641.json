{"title":"Ketone","summary":"In chemistry, a ketone /ˈkiːtoʊn/ is a functional group with the structure R2C=O, where R can be a variety of carbon-containing substituents. Ketones contain a carbonyl group (a carbon-oxygen double bond). The simplest ketone is acetone (R = R' = methyl), with the formula CH3C(O)CH3. Many ketones are of great importance in biology and in industry. Examples include many sugars (ketoses), many steroids (e.g., testosterone), and the solvent acetone.[1]","image":"Ketone-group-2D-skeletal.svg.png.webp"}
