{"title":"Crevasse","summary":"A crevasse is a deep crack, crevice or fissure found in an ice sheet or glacier, or earth. Crevasses form as a result of the movement and resulting stress associated with the shear stress generated when two semi-rigid pieces above a plastic substrate have different rates of movement. The resulting intensity of the shear stress causes a breakage along the faces.","image":"Parque_estatal_Chugach%2C_Alaska%2C_Estados_Unidos%2C_2017-08-22%2C_DD_94.jpg.webp","url":"Crevasse"}
