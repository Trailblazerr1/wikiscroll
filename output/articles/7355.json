{"title":"Bowfin","summary":"The bowfin (Amia calva) is a bony fish, native to North America. Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, griddle, grinnel, swamp trout, and choupique. It is regarded a relict, being the sole surviving species of the Halecomorphi, a group of fish that first appeared during the Early Triassic, around 250 million years ago. The bowfin is often considered a \"primitive fish\" because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors. The closest living relatives of bowfins are gars, with the two groups being united in the clade Holostei.","image":"Amia_calva_4.jpg.webp","url":"Bowfin"}
