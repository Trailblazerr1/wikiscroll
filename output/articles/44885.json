{"title":"Theropoda","summary":"Theropoda (/θɪəˈrɒpədə/[2] from Greek θηρίον 'wild beast'  and πούς, ποδός 'foot'), whose members are known as theropods, is a dinosaur clade that is characterized by hollow bones and three-toed limbs. Theropods are generally classed as a group of saurischian dinosaurs. They were ancestrally carnivorous, although a number of theropod groups evolved to become herbivores, omnivores, piscivores, and insectivores. Theropods first appeared during the Carnian age of the late Triassic period 231.4 million years ago (Ma)[3] and included all the large terrestrial carnivores from the Early Jurassic until at least the close of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma. In the Jurassic, birds evolved from small specialized coelurosaurian theropods, and are today represented by about 10,500 living species.","image":"Theropoda_2.png.webp","url":"Theropoda"}
