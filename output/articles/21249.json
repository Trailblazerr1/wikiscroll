{"title":"Hydrogen vehicle","summary":"A hydrogen vehicle is a type of alternative fuel vehicle that uses hydrogen fuel for motive power. Hydrogen vehicles include hydrogen-fueled space rockets, as well as automobiles and other transportation vehicles. Power is generated by converting the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy, either by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to power electric motors or, less commonly, by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine.[2]","image":"Toyota_FCV_reveal_25_June_2014_-_by_Bertel_Schmitt_02.jpg.webp","url":"Hydrogen_vehicle"}
