{"title":"Cleaning symbiosis","summary":"Cleaning symbiosis is a mutually beneficial association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites and other materials from the surface of the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of cleaner fish, notably wrasses but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.","image":"Flickr_-_Rainbirder_-_Yellow-billed_Oxpecker_(Buphagus_africanus).jpg.webp"}
