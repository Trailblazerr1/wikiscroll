{"title":"Melanoma","summary":"Melanoma, also redundantly known as malignant melanoma,[7][8][9] is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes.[1] Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma).[1][2] In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men, they most commonly occur on the back.[2] About 25% of melanomas develop from moles.[2] Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown.[1]","image":"Melanoma.jpg.webp"}
