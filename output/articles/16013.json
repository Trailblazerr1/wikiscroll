{"title":"Fermi energy","summary":"The Fermi energy is a concept in quantum mechanics usually referring to the energy difference between the highest and lowest occupied single-particle states in a quantum system of non-interacting fermions at absolute zero temperature. In a Fermi gas, the lowest occupied state is taken to have zero kinetic energy, whereas in a metal, the lowest occupied state is typically taken to mean the bottom of the conduction band.","image":"c7957acc8306209f7944dae5172502c550fbe555.svg","url":"Fermi_energy"}
