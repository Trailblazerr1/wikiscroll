{"title":"PDCA","summary":"PDCA (plan–do–check–act or plan–do–check–adjust) is an iterative design and management method used in business for the control and continuous improvement of processes and products.[1] It is also known as the Deming circle/cycle/wheel, the Shewhart cycle, the control circle/cycle, or plan–do–study–act (PDSA). Another version of this PDCA cycle is OPDCA.[2] The added \"O\" stands for observation or as some versions say: \"Observe the current condition.\" This emphasis on observation and current condition has currency with the literature on lean manufacturing and the Toyota Production System.[3] The PDCA cycle, with Ishikawa’s changes, can be traced back to S. Mizuno of the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1959.[4]","image":"PDCA_Cycle.svg.png.webp"}
