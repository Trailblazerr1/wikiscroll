{"title":"The Jungle","summary":"The Jungle is a 1906 novel by the American journalist and novelist Upton Sinclair (1878â€“1968).[1] The novel portrays the harsh conditions and exploited lives of immigrants in the United States in Chicago and similar industrialized cities. Sinclair's primary purpose in describing the meat industry and its working conditions was to advance socialism in the United States.[2] However, most readers were more concerned with several passages exposing health violations and unsanitary practices in the American meat packing industry during the early 20th century, which greatly contributed to a public outcry which led to reforms including the Meat Inspection Act. Sinclair said of the public reaction, \"I aimed at the public's heart, and by accident I hit it in the stomach.\"[3]","image":"The_Jungle_(1906)_cover.jpg.webp"}
