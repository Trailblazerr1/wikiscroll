{"title":"Cajuns","summary":"The Cajuns (/ˈkeɪdʒənz/; Louisiana French: les Cadiens [le ka.dʒɛ̃]), also known as Acadians (Louisiana French: les Acadiens),[3] are an ethnic group mainly living in the U.S. state of Louisiana. They also live in the Canadian maritimes provinces consisting in part of the descendants of the original Acadian exiles—French-speakers from Acadia (L'Acadie) in what are now the Maritimes of Eastern Canada. In Louisiana, Acadian and Cajun are often used as broad cultural terms without reference to actual descent from the deported Acadians. Historically, Louisianians of Acadian descent were also considered to be Louisiana Creoles, although Cajun and Creole are often portrayed as separate identities today. Most Cajuns are of French descent.[4] The Cajuns make up a significant portion of south Louisiana's population and have had an enormous impact on the state's culture.[5]","image":"Flag_of_Acadiana.svg.png.webp"}
