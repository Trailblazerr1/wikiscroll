{"title":"Nutrition facts label","summary":"The nutrition facts label (also known as the nutrition information panel, and other slight variations) is a label required on most packaged food in many countries, showing what nutrients and other ingredients (to limit and get enough of) are in the food. Labels are usually based on official nutritional rating systems. Most countries also release overall nutrition guides for general educational purposes. In some cases, the guides are based on different dietary targets for various nutrients than the labels on specific foods.","image":"US_Nutritional_Fact_Label_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Nutrition_facts_label"}
