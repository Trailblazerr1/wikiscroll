{"title":"Objective-C","summary":"Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.  Originally developed by Brad Cox and Tom Love in the early 1980s, it was selected by NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system.  Objective-C was the standard programming language supported by Apple for developing macOS (which descended from NeXTSTEP[3]) and iOS applications using their respective application programming interfaces (APIs), Cocoa and Cocoa Touch, until the introduction of Swift in 2014.[4]","image":"Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg.png.webp"}
