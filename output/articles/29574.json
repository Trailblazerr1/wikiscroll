{"title":"Metropolitan area","summary":"A metropolitan area or metro is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories sharing industries, commercial areas, transport network, infrastructures and housing.[1] A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, and even states and nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions.[2]","image":"New_York_City%2C_Southern_RI_and_CT%2C_illuminated_at_night.jpg.webp","url":"Metropolitan_area"}
