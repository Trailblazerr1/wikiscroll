{"title":"Sternum","summary":"The sternum or breastbone is a long flat bone located in the central part of the chest. It connects to the ribs via cartilage and forms the front of the rib cage, thus helping to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. Shaped roughly like a necktie, it is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body. Its three regions are the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process.[1] The word \"sternum\" originates from the Ancient Greek στέρνον (stérnon), meaning \"chest\".","image":"Sternum_composition.png.webp","url":"Sternum"}
