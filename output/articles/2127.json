{"title":"Ad hominem","summary":"Ad hominem (Latin for 'to the person'), short for argumentum ad hominem, refers to several types of arguments, some but not all of which are fallacious. Typically this term refers to a rhetorical strategy where the speaker attacks the character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself.  The most common form of ad hominem is \"A makes a claim x, B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument x is wrong\".","image":"Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg.webp","url":"Ad_hominem"}
