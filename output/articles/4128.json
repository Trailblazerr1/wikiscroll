{"title":"Appellation d'origine contrôlée","summary":"In France, the appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC, \"Controlled Designation of Origin\") is a certification of authenticity granted to certain geographical indications for wines, cheeses, butters, and other agricultural products, under the auspices of the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO), based upon the terroir and a form of geographic protectionism.[1] Most products with an AOC designation are also Protected Designations of Origin (PDO)/Appelation d'orrigine protégée (AOP) under EU law and UK law. For those products, only the PDO or AOP designation can be used. However, wines with a PDO/AOP status can still use the French AOC designation.[2]","image":"France-AOC_Piment_d'Espelette-2005-08-05.jpg.webp","url":"Appellation_d'origine_contrôlée"}
