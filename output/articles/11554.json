{"title":"Crossover (automobile)","summary":"A crossover, crossover SUV,[1] or crossover utility vehicle (CUV) is a type of sport utility vehicle-like vehicle built with unibody frame construction. A term that originated from North America, crossovers are based on a platform shared with a passenger car, as opposed to a platform shared with a pickup truck. Because of that, crossovers may also be referred as \"car-based SUVs\".[2][3] Compared to truck-based SUVs, they typically have better interior comfort, a more comfortable ride, better fuel economy, and lower manufacturing costs, but also inferior off-road and towing capability.[4][5][6] Forerunners of the modern crossover include the 1977 Matra Rancho and the AMC Eagle introduced in 1979.[7]","image":"2010_Ford_Flex_Limited_1_--_11-25-2009.jpg.webp","url":"Crossover_(automobile)"}
