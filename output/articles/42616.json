{"title":"Subterranean Jungle","summary":"Subterranean Jungle is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, released by Sire Records on February 23, 1983. Overall, the album featured a return to a somewhat more hard punk rock style compared to the band's previous 2 LPs (End of the Century (1980) and Pleasant Dreams (1981)), which were the most pop-focused of the band's career. This direction was encouraged by guitarist Johnny Ramone. The recording sessions saw disputes between band members, mainly due to struggles with alcohol addiction by Joey Ramone and Marky Ramone, and the drug addiction of Dee Dee Ramone.","image":"Ramones_-_Subterranean_Jungle_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Subterranean_Jungle"}
