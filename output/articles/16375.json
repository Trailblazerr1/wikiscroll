{"title":"Flag of Grenada","summary":"The flag of Grenada consists of two yellow triangles at the top and bottom and two green triangles at the hoist and fly.  These are surrounded by a red border charged with six five-pointed yellow stars – three at the top centre and three at the bottom centre – along with an additional star on a red disc at the centre and a nutmeg at the hoist triangle.  Adopted in 1974 to replace the temporary design used since the islands became an Associated State of the United Kingdom, it has been the flag of Grenada since the country gained independence that year.  Designed by a local Grenadian, it utilizes the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement.  The representation of a nutmeg is symbolic of the islands' primary export, and was the one feature from the previous flag that was preserved.","image":"Flag_of_Grenada.svg.png.webp"}
