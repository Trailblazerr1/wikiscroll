{"title":"Tetragrammaton","summary":"The Tetragrammaton (/ˌtɛtrəˈɡræmətɒn/) or Tetragram (from Greek τετραγράμματον, meaning \"[consisting of] four letters\") is the four-letter Hebrew word יהוה‎ (transliterated as YHWH), the name of the national god of Israel. The four letters, read from right to left, are yodh, he, waw, and he.[1] While there is no consensus about the structure and etymology of the name, the form Yahweh is now accepted almost universally.[2][3]","image":"Tetragrammaton_scripts.svg.png.webp"}
