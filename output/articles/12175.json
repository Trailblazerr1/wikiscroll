According to the 2010 census, the city had a population of 99,685 (making it Iowa's third-largest city).  The city appealed this figure, arguing that the Census Bureau missed a section of residents, and that its total population was more than 100,000.[5][6] The Census Bureau estimated Davenport's 2019 population to be 101,590.[7]","image":"Davenport%2C_Iowa_Montage.jpg.webp","url":"Davenport,_Iowa"}
