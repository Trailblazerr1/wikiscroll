{"title":"List of National Treasures of Japan (residences)","summary":"The term \"National Treasure\" has been used in Japan to denote cultural properties since 1897.[1]\nThe items are selected by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on their \"especially high historical or artistic value\".[2][3] This list presents 14[nb 1] entries of residential structures from 15th-century feudal Muromachi period to the early modern 17th-century Edo period. The structures listed include teahouses, shoin, guest or reception halls and other rooms which are part of Japanese domestic architecture, while most of the structures are located in temples, one is a castle.[3] In 2009, the early 20th century Akasaka Palace was designated as National Treasure in the category of \"modern residences\" (Meiji period and later). Because it is the only National Treasure in this category, it is listed together with the 14 pre-Meiji period structures.[4]","image":"Taisehokan.jpg.webp"}
