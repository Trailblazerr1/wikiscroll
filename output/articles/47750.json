{"title":"Voynich manuscript","summary":"The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an otherwise unknown writing system, referred to as 'Voynichese'.[18] The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404â€“1438), and stylistic analysis indicates it may have been composed in Italy during the Italian Renaissance.[1][2] The origins, authorship, and purpose of the manuscript are debated. Various hypotheses have been suggested, including that it is an otherwise unrecorded script for a natural language or constructed language; an unread code, cypher, or other form of cryptography; or simply a meaningless hoax.","image":"Voynich_Manuscript_(32).jpg.webp","url":"Voynich_manuscript"}
