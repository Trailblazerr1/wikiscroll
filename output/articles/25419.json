{"title":"Lambda calculus","summary":"Lambda calculus (also written as Î»-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. It is a universal model of computation that can be used to simulate any Turing machine. It was introduced by the mathematician Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his research into the foundations of mathematics.","image":"18d95a7845e4e16ffb7e18ab37a208d0ab18e0e0.svg"}
