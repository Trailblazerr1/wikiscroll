{"title":"Goodpasture syndrome","summary":"Goodpasture syndrome (GPS), also known as anti-glomerular basement membrane disease,  is a rare autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack the basement membrane in lungs and kidneys, leading to bleeding from the lungs, glomerulonephritis,[1] and kidney failure.[2] It is thought to attack the alpha-3 subunit of type IV collagen, which has therefore been referred to as Goodpasture's antigen.[3] Goodpasture syndrome may quickly result in permanent lung and kidney damage, often leading to death. It is treated with medications that suppress the immune system such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and with plasmapheresis, in which the antibodies are removed from the blood.","image":"Crescentic_glomerulonephritis_-_high_mag.jpg.webp","url":"Goodpasture_syndrome"}
