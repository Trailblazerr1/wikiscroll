{"title":"Avian influenza","summary":"Avian influenza, known informally as avian flu or bird flu, is a variety of influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds.[1][2][3][4][5][note 1][6] The type with the greatest risk is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Bird flu is similar to swine flu, dog flu, horse flu and human flu as an illness caused by strains of influenza viruses that have adapted to a specific host. Out of the three types of influenza viruses (A, B, and C), influenza A virus is a zoonotic infection with a natural reservoir almost entirely in birds.[7] Avian influenza, for most purposes, refers to the influenza A virus.","image":"H1N1_navbox.jpg.webp"}
