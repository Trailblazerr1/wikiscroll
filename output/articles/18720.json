{"title":"Grassroots","summary":"A grassroots movement is one that uses the people in a given district, region or community as the basis for a political or economic movement.[1] Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures.[2]","image":"Protest_for_housing_rights_at_Bakats_square.jpeg.webp"}
