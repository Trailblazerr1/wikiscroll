{"title":"Zeta Beta Tau","summary":"Zeta Beta Tau (ΖΒΤ) is a Greek-letter social fraternity based in North America. It was founded on December 29, 1898, at City College of New York and is recognized as the first Jewish collegiate social fraternity. Originally a Zionist youth society, its purpose changed from Zionism in the fraternity's early years, and in 1954 the organization became nonsectarian and opened itself to non-Jewish members, changing its membership policy to include \"All Men of Good Character.\"","image":"Zeta_Beta_Tau_Crest.png.webp"}
