{"title":"Extracellular matrix","summary":"In biology, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a three-dimensional network consisting of  extracellular macromolecules and minerals, such as collagen, enzymes, glycoproteins and hydroxyapatite that provide structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells.[1][2][3] Because multicellularity evolved independently in different multicellular lineages, the composition of ECM varies between multicellular structures; however, cell adhesion, cell-to-cell communication and differentiation are common functions of the ECM.[4]","image":"Extracellular_Matrix.png.webp","url":"Extracellular_matrix"}
