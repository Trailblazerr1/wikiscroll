{"title":"'Ndrangheta","summary":"The  'Ndrangheta (/(ən)dræŋˈɡɛtə/,[6] Italian: [nˈdraŋɡeta], Calabrian: [(ɳ)ˈɖɽaɲɟɪta])[lower-alpha 1] is a prominent Italian Mafia-type[7] organized crime syndicate and criminal society based in the peninsular and mountainous region of Calabria and dating back to the late 18th century. It is considered to be the most powerful and dangerous organized crime group in the world.[8]\nSince the 1950s, following wide-scale emigration from Calabria, the organization has established itself worldwide. The 'Ndrangheta is the only one of the mafia-type criminal organizations operating in Italy to have maintained the rites that distinguished it in the past, passing them down orally and through codes that, on rare occasions, have been discovered. It is characterized by a horizontal structure made up of autonomous clans known as 'ndrine, based almost exclusively on blood ties.  Its main activity is drug trafficking, of which it has a monopoly in Europe, but it also deals with arms trafficking, money laundering, racketeering, extortion, loan sharking, prostitution. The 'Ndrangheta has enjoyed, for decades, a privileged relationship with the main South American drug cartels, which consider it the most reliable European partner. It is capable of heavily influencing local and national politics and infiltrating large sectors of the legal economy. In 2013 they purportedly made €53 billion according to a study from Demoskopika Research Institute.[9]A US diplomat estimated that the organization's narcotics trafficking, extortion and money laundering activities accounted for at least three per cent of Italy's GDP in 2010.[10]","image":"Struttura_ndrangheta.jpg.webp"}
