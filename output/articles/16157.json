{"title":"Fin whale","summary":"The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), also known as finback whale or common rorqual and formerly known as herring whale or razorback whale, is a cetacean belonging to the parvorder of baleen whales. It is the second-longest species of cetacean on Earth after the blue whale.[8] The largest reportedly grow to 27.3 m (89.6 ft) long[9] with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9 m (85 ft),[10] a maximum recorded weight of nearly 74 tonnes (73 long tons; 82 short tons),[11] and a maximum estimated weight of around 114 tonnes (112 long tons; 126 short tons). American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale \"the greyhound of the sea ... for its beautiful, slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship.\"[12]","image":"Finhval_(1).jpg.webp","url":"Fin_whale"}
