{"title":"Diorite","summary":"Diorite (/ˈdaɪ.əraɪt/ DY-ə-ryte)[1][2] is an intrusive igneous rock composed principally of the silicate minerals plagioclase feldspar (typically andesine), biotite, hornblende, and/or pyroxene. The chemical composition of diorite is intermediate, between that of mafic gabbro and felsic granite. Diorite is usually grey to dark grey in colour, but it can also be black or bluish-grey, and frequently has a greenish cast. It is distinguished from gabbro on the basis of the composition of the plagioclase species; the plagioclase in diorite is richer in sodium and poorer in calcium.","image":"lossy-page1-220px-Diorite2.tif.jpg.webp"}
