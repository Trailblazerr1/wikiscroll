{"title":"BitLocker","summary":"BitLocker is a full volume encryption feature included with Microsoft Windows versions starting with Windows Vista. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. By default, it uses the AES encryption algorithm in cipher block chaining (CBC) or XTS mode[1] with a 128-bit or 256-bit key.[2][3] CBC is not used over the whole disk; it is applied to each individual sector.[3]","image":"BitLocker_icon.png.webp","url":"BitLocker"}
