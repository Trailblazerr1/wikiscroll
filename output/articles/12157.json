{"title":"Date of Easter","summary":"As a moveable feast,[1][2] the date of Easter is determined in each year through a calculation known as computus (Latin for 'computation').[3] Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the Paschal full moon, which is the first full moon on or after 21 March (a fixed approximation of the March equinox). Determining this date in advance requires a correlation between the lunar months and the solar year, while also accounting for the month, date, and weekday of the Julian or Gregorian calendar.[4] The complexity of the algorithm arises because of the desire to associate the date of Easter with the date of the Jewish feast of Passover which, Christians believe, is when Jesus was crucified.[5]","image":"Calendario_pasquale.jpg.webp"}
