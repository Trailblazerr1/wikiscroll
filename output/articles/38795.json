{"title":"Rust (programming language)","summary":"Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.[12][13] Rust is syntactically similar to C++,[14] but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.[15] Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.[16][17] Rust has been called a systems programming language and in addition to high-level features such as functional programming it also offers mechanisms for low-level memory management.","image":"Rust_programming_language_black_logo.svg.png.webp"}
