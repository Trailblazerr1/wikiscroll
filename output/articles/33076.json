{"title":"Open Database Connectivity","summary":"In computing, Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) is a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems (DBMS). The designers of ODBC aimed to make it independent of database systems and operating systems. An application written using ODBC can be ported to other platforms, both on the client and server side, with few changes to the data access code.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp"}
