{"title":"Montreal Screwjob","summary":"The Montreal Screwjob (also called the Montreal Incident;[1][2][3] French: Le Coup Tordu de Montréal lit. Montreal's Twisted Coup) was an infamous and controversial unscripted professional wrestling incident that occurred on November 9, 1997, at the Survivor Series pay per view at the Molson Centre in which World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE) owner Vince McMahon and WWF employees covertly manipulated the pre-determined outcome of the match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels. The manipulation – a \"shoot screwjob\" in professional wrestling parlance – occurred without Hart's knowledge and resulted in Hart, the reigning WWF Champion, losing the title to Michaels in his last WWF match before departing for rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW). The \"screwjob\" is generally believed to be an off-screen betrayal of Hart, who was one of the WWF's longest-tenured and most popular performers of all time.","image":"Seriesscrewjob.jpg.webp"}
