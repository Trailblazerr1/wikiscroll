{"title":"The Fat Duck","summary":"The Fat Duck is a fine dining restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, England.  It is run by celebrity chef proprietor Heston Blumenthal.  Housed in a 16th-century building that had previously been the site of The Bell pub, The Fat Duck opened on 16 August  1995.  Although it originally served food similar to that of a French bistro, it soon acquired a reputation for precision and invention, and has been at the forefront of many modern culinary developments, such as food pairing, flavour encapsulation and multi-sensory cooking.[2]","image":"Fat_Duck_Logo.jpg.webp","url":"The_Fat_Duck"}
