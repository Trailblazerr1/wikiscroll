{"title":"Surface runoff","summary":"Surface runoff (also known as overland flow) is the flow of water occurring on the ground surface when excess rainwater, stormwater, meltwater, or other sources, can no longer sufficiently rapidly infiltrate in the soil. This can occur when the soil is saturated by water to its full capacity, and that the rain arrives more quickly than the soil can absorb it. Surface runoff often occurs because impervious areas (such as roofs and pavement) do not allow water to soak into the ground. Furthermore, runoff can occur either through natural or man-made processes.[1] Surface runoff is a major component of the water cycle. It is the primary agent of soil erosion by water.[2][3] The land area producing runoff that drains to a common point is called a drainage basin.","image":"Runoff.jpg.webp","url":"Surface_runoff"}
