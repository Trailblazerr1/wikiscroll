{"title":"Gay-Lussac's law","summary":"Gay-Lussac's law (also referred to as Amonton's law) states that the pressure of a given mass of gas varies directly with the absolute temperature of the gas when the volume is kept constant.[1]\nMathematically, it can be written as: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            P\n            T\n          \n        \n        =\n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {P}{T}}=k}\n  \n. It is a special case of the ideal gas law. Gay-Lussac is incorrectly recognized for the Pressure Law which established that the pressure of an enclosed gas is directly proportional to its temperature and which he was the first to formulate (c. 1809).[2] He is also sometimes credited[3][4][5] with being the first to publish convincing evidence that shows the relationship between the pressure and temperature of a fixed mass of gas kept at a constant volume.[4]","image":"4cd53f424daf3ee56d9e82976692c5ddb6e47448.svg"}
