{"title":"Falsifiability","summary":"In the philosophy of science, a theory is falsifiable (or refutable) if it is contradicted by an observation statement that has a conventional empirical interpretation, i.e., is potentially[upper-alpha 2] observable with existing technologies.  For example, \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable, because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and this is observable.[upper-alpha 3] This existent contradiction with an observation statement does not imply at all that the theory is methodologically, i.e., in practice, false.[upper-alpha 4] The contradictory observation statement, also called a potential falsifier, can correspond to an imaginary state of affairs:[upper-alpha 1] the corresponding (past, present or future) falsification may not be the case.[upper-alpha 5] As a logical construction, the falsifier may be rigorously in contradiction with well-established laws,  but its corresponding state of affairs  must be potentially observable with existing technologies that would be  valid in scientific evidence against the theory.","image":"Black_Swans.jpg.webp","url":"Falsifiability"}
