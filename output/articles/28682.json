{"title":"Martha's Vineyard","summary":"Martha's Vineyard (Wampanoag: Noepe; often simply called the Vineyard)[2] is an island located south of Cape Cod in Massachusetts in the United States in North America that is known for being a popular summer colony. Martha's Vineyard includes the smaller adjacent Chappaquiddick Island, which is usually connected to the Vineyard. The two islands have sometimes been separated by storms and hurricanes, which last occurred from 2007 to 2015.[3][4] It is the 58th largest island in the United States, with a land area of about 96 square miles (250Â km2),[5] and the third-largest on the East Coast of the United States, after Long Island and Mount Desert Island. Martha's Vineyard constitutes the bulk of Dukes County, Massachusetts, which also includes the Elizabeth Islands and the island of Nomans Land.","image":"Martha's_Vineyard_map.png.webp","url":"Martha's_Vineyard"}
