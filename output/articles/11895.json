{"title":"DNA and RNA codon tables","summary":"A codon table can be used to translate a genetic code into a sequence of amino acids.[1][2] The standard genetic code is traditionally represented as an RNA codon table, because when proteins are made in a cell by ribosomes, it is messenger RNA (mRNA) that directs protein synthesis.[2][3] The mRNA sequence is determined by the sequence of genomic DNA.[4] In this context, the standard genetic code is referred to as translation table 1.[3] It can also be represented in a DNA codon table. The DNA codons in such tables occur on the sense DNA strand and are arranged in a 5′-to-3′ direction. Different tables with alternate codons are used depending on the source of the genetic code, such as from a cell nucleus, mitochondrion, plastid, or hydrogenosome.[5]","image":"Aminoacids_table.svg.png.webp"}
