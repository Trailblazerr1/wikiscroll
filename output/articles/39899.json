{"title":"Secularism","summary":"Secularism is the principle of seeking to conduct human affairs based on secular, naturalistic considerations. It is most commonly defined as the separation of religion from civic affairs and the state — which in accordance with religious pluralism defines secularism as neutrality (of the state or non-sectarian institution) on issues of religion as opposed to total opposition of religion in the public square as a whole — while other views may broaden it to a position concerning the need to remove or minimalize the role of religion in any public sphere.[1] The term has a broad range of meanings, and in the most schematic, may encapsulate any stance that promotes the secular in any given context.[2][3] It may connote anticlericalism, atheism, antitheism, naturalism, non-sectarianism, secularity, neutrality on topics of religion, or the (complete) removal of religious symbols from public institutions.[4]","image":"Holyoake2.JPG.webp","url":"Secularism"}
