{"title":"Spectroscopy","summary":"Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation.[1][2][3][4][5][6] In simpler terms, spectroscopy is the precise study of color as generalized from visible light to all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum; indeed, historically, spectroscopy originated as the study of the wavelength dependence  of the absorption by gas phase matter of visible light dispersed by a prism. Matter waves and acoustic waves can also be considered forms of radiative energy, and recently gravitational waves have been associated with a spectral signature in the context of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO).","image":"Light_dispersion_of_a_mercury-vapor_lamp_with_a_flint_glass_prism_IPNrÂ°0125.jpg.webp","url":"Spectroscopy"}
