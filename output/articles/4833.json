{"title":"Atmosphere of Uranus","summary":"The atmosphere of Uranus is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. At depth it is significantly enriched in volatiles (dubbed \"ices\") such as water, ammonia and methane. The opposite is true for the upper atmosphere, which contains very few gases heavier than hydrogen and helium due to its low temperature. Uranus's atmosphere is the coldest of all the planets, with its temperature reaching as low as 49Â K.","image":"Uranus2.jpg.webp","url":"Atmosphere_of_Uranus"}
