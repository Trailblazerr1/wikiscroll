{"title":"Leukemia","summary":"Leukemia (also spelled leukaemia and pronounced /luːˈkiːmiːə/[1] loo-KEE-mee-ə), is a group of blood cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal blood cells.[9] These blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells.[2] Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising, bone pain, fatigue, fever, and an increased risk of infections.[2] These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells.[2] Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.[2]","image":"Acute_leukemia-ALL.jpg.webp"}
