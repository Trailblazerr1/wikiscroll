{"title":"Rigour","summary":"Rigour (British English) or rigor (American English; see spelling differences) describes a condition of stiffness or strictness.[1] Rigour frequently refers to a process of adhering absolutely to certain constraints, or the practice of maintaining strict consistency with certain predefined parameters. These constraints may be environmentally imposed, such as \"the rigours of famine\"; logically imposed, such as mathematical proofs which must maintain consistent answers; or socially imposed, such as the process of defining ethics and law.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
