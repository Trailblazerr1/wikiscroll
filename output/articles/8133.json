{"title":"Cabinet (government)","summary":"A cabinet is a body of high-ranking state officials, typically consisting of the executive branch's top leaders.  Members of a cabinet are usually called cabinet ministers or secretaries. The function of a cabinet varies: in some countries, it is a collegiate decision-making body with collective responsibility, while in others it may function either as a purely advisory body or an assisting institution to a decision-making head of state or head of government. Cabinets are typically the body responsible for the day-to-day management of the government and response to sudden events, whereas the legislative and judicial branches work in a measured pace, in sessions according to lengthy procedures.","image":"The_Cabinet_table.jpg.webp"}
