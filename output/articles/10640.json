{"title":"Commerce Clause","summary":"The Commerce Clause describes an enumerated power listed in the United States Constitution (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3). The clause states that the United States Congress shall have power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" Courts and commentators have tended to discuss each of these three areas of commerce as a separate power granted to Congress.[1] It is common to see the individual components of the Commerce Clause referred to under specific terms: the Foreign Commerce Clause, the Interstate Commerce Clause,[2] and the Indian Commerce Clause.","image":"Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Commerce_Clause"}
