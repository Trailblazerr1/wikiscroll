{"title":"Induced pluripotent stem cell","summary":"Induced pluripotent stem cells (also known as iPS cells or iPSCs) are a type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from a somatic cell. The iPSC technology was pioneered by Shinya Yamanakaâ€™s lab in Kyoto, Japan, who showed in 2006 that the introduction of four specific genes (named Myc, Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4), collectively known as Yamanaka factors, encoding transcription factors could convert somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells.[1] He was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize along with Sir John Gurdon \"for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent.\"[2]","image":"Human_iPS_cells_colonies.png.webp","url":"Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"}
