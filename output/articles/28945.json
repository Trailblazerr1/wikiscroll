{"title":"Matter wave","summary":"Matter waves are a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics, being an example of waveâ€“particle duality. All matter exhibits wave-like behavior. For example, a beam of electrons can be diffracted just like a beam of light or a water wave. In most cases, however, the wavelength is too small to have a practical impact on day-to-day activities.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Matter_wave"}
