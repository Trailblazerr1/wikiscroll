{"title":"The Road Warriors","summary":"The Road Warriors, also known as the Legion of Doom, were a professional wrestling tag team composed of Road Warrior Hawk (Michael Hegstrand) and Road Warrior Animal (Joseph Laurinaitis)[1] They performed under the name \"The Road Warriors\" in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and the name \"Legion of Doom\" (LOD) in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Under either name, their gimmick was the same â€“ two imposing wrestlers in face paint. For brief periods, other wrestlers were added as stand-in partners for both men. In Japan in the 1990s, Kensuke \"Power Warrior\" Sasaki often teamed with Hawk and Animal, separately and together, while in WWE were joined by Droz in the 1990s and Heidenreich in the 2000s. The team also had three managers: Sunny in the 1990s, Chirsty Hemme in the 2000s, and Paul Ellering, the manager associated with the original team.","image":"The_Road_Warriors.png.webp"}
