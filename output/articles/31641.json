{"title":"Nemertea","summary":"Nemertea is a phylum of invertebrate animals also known as ribbon worms or proboscis worms.[2] Alternative names for the phylum have included Nemertini, Nemertinea and Rhynchocoela.[1] Most are very slim, usually only a few millimeters wide, although a few have relatively short but wide bodies. Many have patterns of yellow, orange, red and green coloration. The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body, the anus is at the tip of the tail, and the mouth is under the front. A little above the gut is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. All species have a proboscis which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but everts (turns inside-out) to emerge just above the mouth and capture the animal's prey with venom. A highly extensible muscle in the back of the rhynchocoel pulls the proboscis in when an attack ends. A few species with stubby bodies filter feed and have suckers at the front and back ends, with which they attach to a host.","image":"Nemertea_by_Joubin.jpg.webp","url":"Nemertea"}
