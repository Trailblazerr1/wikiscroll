{"title":"Girl Scout Cookies","summary":"Girl Scout Cookies are cookies sold by Girl Scouts in the United States to raise funds to support Girl Scout councils and individual troops. The cookies are widely popular and are commonly sold by going door to door, online, through school- or town-wide fundraisers, or at \"cookie booths\" commonly set up at storefronts.[1] The program is intended to both raise money and improve the financial literacy of girls. During an average selling season (usually January through April), more than one million girls sell over 200 million packages of cookies and raise over $800 million.[2][3][4] The first known sale of cookies by Girl Scouts was in 1917.[5][6][7] Cookie sales are organized by 112 regional Girl Scout councils[8] who select one of two national bakeries to buy cookies from.[4][9]","image":"Girl_Scout_cookies_(Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA).jpg.webp"}
