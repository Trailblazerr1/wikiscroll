{"title":"May Revolution","summary":"The May Revolution (Spanish: Revolución de Mayo) was a week-long series of events that took place from May 18 to 25, 1810, in Buenos Aires, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This Spanish colony included roughly the territories of present-day Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts of Brazil. The result was the removal of Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros and the establishment of a local government, the Primera Junta (First Junta), on May 25. The junta would eventually become the country of Argentina. It was the first successful revolution in the South American Independence process.","image":"Cabildo_Abierto_-_Pedro_Subercaseaux.jpg.webp","url":"May_Revolution"}
