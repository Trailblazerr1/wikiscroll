{"title":"Kurdistan Region","summary":"The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI; Kurdish: ھەرێمی کوردستان‎, romanized: Herêma Kurdistanê,[12][13] Arabic: اقليم كردستان‎[14]), also known as Iraqi Kurdistan, is an autonomous region[15] in Iraq comprising the four Kurdish-majority governorates of Dohuk, Erbil, Halabja, and Sulaymaniyah and bordering Iran, Syria, and Turkey. The Kurdistan Region encompasses most of Iraqi Kurdistan but excludes the disputed territories of Northern Iraq, contested between the Kurdistan Regional Government and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad since 1992 when autonomy was realized. The Kurdistan Region Parliament is situated in Erbil, but the constitution of the Kurdistan Region declares the disputed city of Kirkuk to be the capital of the Kurdistan Region. When the Iraqi Army withdrew from most of the disputed areas in mid-2014 because of the ISIL offensive in Northern Iraq, Kurdish Peshmerga entered the areas and held control there until Iraq retook the areas in October 2017.[16]","image":"Flag_of_Kurdistan.svg.png.webp","url":"Kurdistan_Region"}
