{"title":"Robert Schumann","summary":"Robert Alexander Schumann[lower-alpha 1] (German: [ˈʃuːman]; 8 June 1810 – 29 July 1856) was a German composer, pianist, and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. Schumann left the study of law, intending to pursue a career as a virtuoso pianist. His teacher, Friedrich Wieck, a German pianist, had assured him that he could become the finest pianist in Europe, but a hand injury ended this dream. Schumann then focused his musical energies on composing.","image":"Robert_Schumann_1839.jpg.webp","url":"Robert_Schumann"}
