{"title":"Pillars of Hercules","summary":"The Pillars of Hercules (Latin: Columnae Herculis, Ancient Greek: Ἡράκλειαι Στῆλαι, romanized: Hērákleiai Stêlai, Arabic: أعمدة هرقل‎, romanized: Aʿmidat Hiraql, Spanish: Columnas de Hércules) was the phrase that was applied in Antiquity to the promontories that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar. The northern Pillar, Calpe Mons, is the Rock of Gibraltar. A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar, Abila Mons, has been disputed throughout history,[1] with the two most likely candidates being Monte Hacho in Ceuta and Jebel Musa in Morocco.","image":"De_Zuilen_van_Hercules_Gibraltar_en_Ceuta.jpg.webp"}
