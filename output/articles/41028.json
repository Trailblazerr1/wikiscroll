{"title":"Smiley Smile","summary":"Smiley Smile is the 12th studio album by American rock band the Beach Boys, released on September 18, 1967. It reached number 9 on UK record charts, but sold poorly in the US, peaking at number 41â€”the band's lowest chart placement to that point. Critics and fans generally received the album and its lead single, \"Heroes and Villains\", with confusion and disappointment. \"Good Vibrations\" and \"Gettin' Hungry\" were also released as singles, but the former was issued a year earlier, while the latter was not credited to the band.","image":"Smileysmilebeachboys.png.webp"}
