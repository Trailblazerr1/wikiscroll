{"title":"Yakuza","summary":"Yakuza (Japanese: ヤクザ, IPA: [jaꜜkɯza]), also known as gokudō (極道, \"the extreme path\", IPA: [gokɯꜜdoː]), are members of transnational organized crime syndicates originating in Japan. The Japanese police and media by request of the police, calls them bōryokudan (暴力団, \"violent groups\", IPA: [boːɾʲokɯꜜdaɴ]), while the yakuza call themselves ninkyō dantai (任侠団体, \"chivalrous organizations\", IPA: [ɲiŋkʲoː dantai]). The English equivalent for the term yakuza is gangster, meaning an individual involved in a Mafia-like criminal organization.[2] The yakuza are known for their strict codes of conduct, their organized fiefdom nature and several unconventional ritual practices such as yubitsume or amputation of the left little finger.[3] Members are often described as males, wearing \"sharp suits\" with heavily tattooed bodies and slicked hair.[4] This group is still regarded as being among \"the most sophisticated and wealthiest criminal organizations\".[5]","image":"Yakuza-katakana.svg.png.webp"}
