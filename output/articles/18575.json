{"title":"Government of Ireland Act 1920","summary":"The Government of Ireland Act 1920 (10 & 11 Geo. 5 c. 67) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act's long title was \"An Act to provide for the better government of Ireland\"; it is also known as the Fourth Home Rule Bill or (inaccurately) as the Fourth Home Rule Act. The Act was intended to partition Ireland into two self-governing polities: the six north-eastern counties were to form \"Northern Ireland\", while the larger part of the country was to form \"Southern Ireland\".  Both territories were to remain part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and provision was made for their future reunification through a Council of Ireland. The Act was passed by the British parliament in November 1920, received royal assent in December, and came into force on 3 May 1921.[2][3]","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom_(1837-1952).svg.png.webp","url":"Government_of_Ireland_Act_1920"}
