{"title":"Intron","summary":"An intron (for intragenic region) is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product.[1][2] In other words, introns are non-coding regions of an RNA transcript, or the DNA encoding it, that are eliminated by splicing before translation.[3][4] The word intron is derived from the term intragenic region, i.e. a region inside a gene.[5] The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.[6] Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons.[7]","image":"Pre-mRNA_to_mRNA_MH.svg.png.webp"}
