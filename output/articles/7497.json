{"title":"Breaking wheel","summary":"The breaking wheel or execution wheel, also known as the Catherine wheel or simply the Wheel, was a torture method used for public execution primarily in Europe from antiquity through the Middle Ages into the early modern period by breaking the bones of a criminal or bludgeoning them to death. The practice was abolished in Bavaria in 1813 and in the Electorate of Hesse in 1836: the last known execution by the \"Wheel\" took place in Prussia in 1841. In the Holy Roman Empire it was a \"mirror punishment\" for highwaymen and street thieves, and was set out in the Sachsenspiegel for murder, and arson that resulted in fatalities.[1]","image":"17XX_Richtrad_anagoria.JPG.webp","url":"Breaking_wheel"}
