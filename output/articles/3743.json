Formal standards of animal welfare vary between contexts, but are debated mostly by animal welfare groups, legislators, and academics.[1][2] Animal welfare science uses measures such as longevity, disease, immunosuppression, behavior, physiology, and reproduction,[3] although there is debate about which of these best indicate animal welfare.","image":"FEMA_-_3634_-_Photograph_by_Leif_Skoogfors_taken_on_07-21-2001_in_West_Virginia.jpg.webp","url":"Animal_welfare"}
