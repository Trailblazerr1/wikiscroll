{"title":"Vicar","summary":"A vicar (/ˈvɪkər/; Latin: vicarius) is a representative, deputy or substitute; anyone acting \"in the person of\" or agent for a superior (compare \"vicarious\" in the sense of \"at second hand\"). Linguistically, vicar is cognate with the English prefix \"vice\", similarly meaning \"deputy\". The title appears in a number of Christian ecclesiastical contexts, but also as an administrative title, or title modifier, in the Roman Empire. In addition, in the Holy Roman Empire a local representative of the emperor, perhaps an archduke, might be styled \"vicar\".","image":"Penzance_-_Vicarage.jpg.webp"}
