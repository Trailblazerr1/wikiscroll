{"title":"Cultural Revolution Group","summary":"The (Central) Cultural Revolution Group (CRG or CCRG; Chinese: 中央文革小组; pinyin: Zhōngyāng Wéngé Xiǎozǔ) was formed in May 1966 as a replacement organisation to the Central Committee Secretariat and the \"Five Man Group\", and was initially directly responsible to the Standing Committee of the Politburo.  It consisted mainly of radical supporters of Mao, including Chen Boda, the Chairman's wife Jiang Qing, Kang Sheng, Yao Wenyuan, Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Li and Xie Fuzhi.  The CRG played a central role in the Cultural Revolution's first few years, and for a period of time the group replaced the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) as the de facto top power organ of China.  Its members were also involved in many of the major events of the Cultural Revolution.","image":"1967-01_1966年毛泽东林彪周恩来陈伯达.jpg.webp"}
