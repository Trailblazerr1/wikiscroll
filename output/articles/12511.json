{"title":"Delirium","summary":"Delirium (also known as acute confusional state) is an organically caused decline from a previous baseline mental functioning, that develops over a short period of time, typically hours to days.[1][2] Delirium is a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, such as psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleep-wake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions), although these features are not required for diagnosis.","image":"An_alcoholic_man_with_delirium_Wellcome_L0060780_(level_correction).jpg.webp","url":"Delirium"}
