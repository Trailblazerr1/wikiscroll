{"title":"Duodecimal","summary":"The duodecimal system (also known as base 12, dozenal, or, rarely, uncial) is a positional notation numeral system using twelve as its base. The number twelve (that is, the number written as \"12\" in the base ten numerical system) is instead written as \"10\" in duodecimal (meaning \"1 dozen and 0 units\", instead of \"1 ten and 0 units\"), whereas the digit string \"12\" means \"1 dozen and 2 units\" (i.e. the same number that in decimal is written as \"14\"). Similarly, in duodecimal \"100\" means \"1 gross\", \"1000\" means \"1 great gross\", and \"0.1\" means \"1 twelfth\" (instead of their decimal meanings \"1 hundred\", \"1 thousand\", and \"1 tenth\").","image":"Dozenal_us_10.svg.png.webp"}
