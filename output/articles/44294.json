{"title":"The Itchy & Scratchy Show","summary":"The Itchy & Scratchy Show (often shortened as Itchy & Scratchy) is an American fictional animated television series featured in the American animated television series The Simpsons. The show depicts a blue mouse, Itchy, who repeatedly and violently maims and/or kills a black cat, Scratchy, typically presented as 15 to 60 second-long cartoons that are a part of The Krusty the Clown Show. The show is filled with gratuitous violence that almost invariably prompts uproarious laughter from Bart and Lisa, and Homer when he occasionally watches.","image":"Itchy%26Scratchy.jpg.webp","url":"The_Itchy_&_Scratchy_Show"}
