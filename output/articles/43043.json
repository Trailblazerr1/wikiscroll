{"title":"Swiss roll","summary":"A Swiss roll, jelly roll, roll cake, cream roll, roulade or Swiss log is a type of rolled sponge cake filled with whipped cream, jam, or icing. The origins of the term are unclear; in spite of the name \"Swiss roll\", the cake is believed to have originated elsewhere in Central Europe, possibly Austria.[1]  It appears to have been invented in the nineteenth century, along with Battenberg cake, doughnuts, and Victoria sponge.[2] In the U.S., commercial versions of the cake are widely known under brand names like Ho Hos, Yodels, and Swiss Cake Rolls. A type of roll cake called Yule log is traditionally served at Christmas.","image":"Sri_Lankan_Swiss_roll.jpg.webp","url":"Swiss_roll"}
