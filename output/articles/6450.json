{"title":"Biblical canon","summary":"A biblical canon, also called canon of scripture, is a set of texts (or \"books\") which a particular Jewish or Christian religious community regards as authoritative scripture.[1] The English word canon comes from the Greek κανών, meaning \"rule\" or \"measuring stick\". It was first used in the 18th century to refer to Christian scriptures, but Dead Sea scrolls scholar Eugene Ulrich identified the concept as Jewish.[2][3]","image":"Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg.webp","url":"Biblical_canon"}
