{"title":"Raksha Bandhan","summary":"Raksha Bandhan,[4] is a popular, traditionally Hindu, annual rite, or ceremony,  which is central to a festival of the same name celebrated in South Asia, and in other parts of the world significantly influenced by Hindu culture. On this day, sisters of all ages tie a talisman, or amulet, called the Rakhi,  around the wrists of their brothers, symbolically protecting them, receiving a gift in return, and traditionally investing the brothers with a share of the responsibility of their potential care.[3]","image":"Rakhi_1.JPG.webp","url":"Raksha_Bandhan"}
