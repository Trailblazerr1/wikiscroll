{"title":"Spinning Around","summary":"\"Spinning Around\" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her seventh studio album Light Years (2000). Written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, Kara DioGuardi and Paula Abdul, the song was initially meant to be recorded by Abdul for her own album, but was given to Minogue after the plan never came to fruition. Produced by Mike Spencer, the disco-influenced dance-pop song was then released in the UK as the lead single from Light Years on 13 June 2000, through Parlophone. Lyrically, the song addresses the theme of reinvention, with Minogue claiming that she has changed as a person and learned from the past.","image":"Kylie_Minogue_Spinning_Around_cover.png.webp"}
