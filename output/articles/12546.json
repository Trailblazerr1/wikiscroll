{"title":"Democracy","summary":"Democracy (Greek: δημοκρατία, dēmokratiā, from dēmos 'people' and kratos 'rule'[1]) is a form of government in which the people have the authority to deliberate and decide legislation (\"direct democracy\"), or to choose governing officials to do so (\"representative democracy\"). Who is considered part of \"the people\" and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries, but over time more and more of a democratic country's inhabitants have generally been included. Cornerstones of democracy include freedom of assembly, association and speech, inclusiveness and equality, citizenship, consent of the governed, voting rights, freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty, and minority rights.","image":"Election_MG_3455.JPG.webp","url":"Democracy"}
