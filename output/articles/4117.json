{"title":"Apostolic constitution","summary":"An apostolic constitution (Latin: constitutio apostolica) is the most solemn form of legislation issued by the Pope.[1][2] The use of the term constitution comes from Latin constitutio, which referred to any important law issued by the Roman emperor, and is retained in church documents because of the inheritance that the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church received from Roman law.","image":"Scale_of_justice%2C_canon_law.svg.png.webp","url":"Apostolic_constitution"}
