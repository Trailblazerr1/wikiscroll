{"title":"Bell Beaker culture","summary":"The Bell Beaker culture (also described as the Bell Beaker complex or Bell Beaker phenomenon) is an archaeological culture named after the inverted-bell beaker drinking vessel used at the very beginning of the European Bronze Age. Arising from around 2800 BC, it lasted in Britain until as late as 1800 BC[2][3] but in continental Europe only until 2300 BC, when it was succeeded by the Unetice culture. Although recent research found Bell Beaker culture's individuals between 2400 and 2100 BC in Bohemia, Czech Republic.[4] The culture was widely dispersed throughout Western Europe, from various regions in Iberia and spots facing northern Africa to the Danubian plains, the islands of Great Britain and Ireland, and also the islands of Sicily and Sardinia. The Bell Beaker phenomenon shows substantial regional variation, and a study[5] from 2018 found that it was associated with genetically diverse populations, with the sampled individuals outside of Iberia and Sicily characterised by significant levels of Pontic-Caspian steppe-related ancestry.","image":"Bell_Beaker_culture.jpg.webp","url":"Bell_Beaker_culture"}
