{"title":"Senate","summary":"A senate is a deliberative assembly, often the upper house or chamber of a bicameral legislature. The name comes from the ancient Roman Senate (Latin: Senatus), so-called as an assembly of the senior (Latin: senex meaning \"the elder\" or \"old man\") and therefore considered wiser and more experienced members of the society or ruling class.","image":"Curia_Iulia.JPG.webp"}
