{"title":"Never Let Me Down","summary":"Never Let Me Down is the 17th studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 20Â April 1987 by EMI America Records. After a series of miscellaneous projects, Bowie hoped to make his next record differently following his disappointment with Tonight (1984). Conceiving the album as the foundation for a theatrical world tour, it was recorded at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland and the Power Station in New York City in the latter half of 1986 into early 1987. It was co-produced by David Richards and marked the first time since 1980's Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) that Bowie played instruments in addition to singing. Musically, Never Let Me Down has been characterised as pop rock and art rock; Bowie himself considered the record a return to rock and roll music. The album cover features Bowie surrounded by numerous elements from the songs.","image":"Never-Let-Me-Down.jpg.webp","url":"Never_Let_Me_Down"}
