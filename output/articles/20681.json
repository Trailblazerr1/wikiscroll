{"title":"Home (The X-Files)","summary":"\"Home\" is the second episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files, which originally aired on the Fox network on OctoberÂ 11, 1996. Directed by Kim Manners, it was written by Glen Morgan and James Wong. \"Home\" is a \"Monster-of-the-Week\" story, unconnected to the overarching mythology of The X-Files. Watched by 18.85 million viewers, the initial broadcast had a Nielsen rating of 11.9. \"Home\" would be the only episode of The X-Files to carry a TV-MA rating upon broadcast and the first to receive a viewer discretion warning for graphic content if the system had been present at the time; the TV Parental Guidelines rating system would be introduced two months later, on December 19, 1996.  Critics were generally complimentary, and praised the disturbing nature of the plot; several made comparisons to the work of director Tobe Hooper. Some reviewers felt the violence was excessive.","image":"XFilesHomePeacock.jpg.webp","url":"Home_(The_X-Files)"}
