{"title":"Aeta people","summary":"The Aeta (Ayta /ˈaɪtə/ EYE-tə), Agta, or Dumagat, are collective terms for several Filipino indigenous peoples who live in various parts of the island of Luzon in the Philippines. They are considered to be part of the Negrito ethnic groups and share common physical characteristics of dark skin tones, short statures, curly to Afro-textured hair, and a higher frequency of naturally lighter hair colour (blondism) relative to the general population. They are thought to be among the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, preceding the Austronesian migrations.[2][3] Regardless, modern Aeta populations have significant Austronesian admixture and speak Austronesian languages.[4]","image":"Young_Negrito_girl%2C_Mariveles%2C_1901.JPG.webp"}
