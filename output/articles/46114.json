{"title":"Tuff","summary":"Tuff is a type of rock made of volcanic ash ejected from a vent during a volcanic eruption. Following ejection and deposition, the ash is lithified into a solid rock.[1][2] Rock that contains greater than 75% ash is considered tuff, while rock containing 25% to 75% ash is described as tuffaceous (for example, tuffaceous sandstone).[3]","image":"Bandelier-Pockmarked_Cliff.jpg.webp","url":"Tuff"}
