{"title":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis","summary":"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG),[1][2][3][4][5] is an extremely rare long-term systemic disorder that involves the formation of granulomas and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It is a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-size vessels in many organs but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys.[6] The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions, and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye.[3]  Damage to the heart, lungs and kidneys can be fatal.","image":"Wegener's_granulomatosis_-b-_intermed_mag.jpg.webp","url":"Granulomatosis_with_polyangiitis"}
