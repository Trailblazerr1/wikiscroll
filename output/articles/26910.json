{"title":"List of monarchs of East Anglia","summary":"The kingdom of East Anglia (also known as the kingdom of the East Angles), was a small independent Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what are now the English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps the eastern part of the Fens. The kingdom was one of the seven traditional members of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The East Angles were initially ruled (from the 6th century until 749) by members of the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose name means 'descendants of the wolf'.[1] The last king was Guthrum II, who ruled in the 10th century.","image":"Stedmundcrownedbyangelspierpontms736f42.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_monarchs_of_East_Anglia"}
