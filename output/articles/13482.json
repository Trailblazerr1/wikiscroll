{"title":"Double-double","summary":"In basketball, a double-double is a single-game performance in which a player accumulates ten or more in two of the following five statistical categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots. The first \"double\" in the term refers to the two (double) categories and the second \"double\" refers to accumulating ten or more (typically double digits) in that category. Similarly, a player records a triple-double, quadruple-double, and quintuple-double when accumulating ten or more in three, four, or all five of the statistical categories, respectively. While double-doubles and triple-doubles occur regularly each NBA season, only four quadruple-doubles have ever officially been recorded in the NBA,[1] and a quintuple-double has only ever been recorded at the high school girls' level.[2] A similar coined term is the five-by-five, is the accumulation of at least five in all five statistical categories.","image":"Wilt_Chamberlain_Nate_Thurmond.jpg.webp"}
