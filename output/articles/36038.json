{"title":"Prime minister","summary":"A prime minister or a premier is the head of the cabinet and the leader of the ministers in the executive branch of government, often in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system. Under those systems, a prime minister is not the head of state or a monarch, but rather the head of government, serving typically under a monarch in a democratic constitutional monarchy or under a president in a republican form of government.","image":"The_Prime_Ministers_of_the_Nordic_Council_in_October_2014_-_09.jpg.webp"}
