{"title":"Basarab I of Wallachia","summary":"Basarab I (Romanian: [basaˈrab] (listen)), also known as Basarab the Founder (Romanian: Basarab Întemeietorul; c. 1270 – 1351/1352), was a voivode and later the first independent ruler of Wallachia who lived in the first half of the 14th century. Many details of his life are uncertain. Although his name is of Turkic origin, 14th-century sources unanimously state that he was a Vlach (Romanian). According to two popular theories, Basarab either came into power between 1304 and 1324 by dethroning or peacefully succeeding the legendary founder of Wallachia, Radu Negru, or in 1310 by succeeding his father, Thocomerius.","image":"Basarab_I_of_Wallachia.jpg.webp","url":"Basarab_I_of_Wallachia"}
