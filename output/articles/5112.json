{"title":"Avro Vulcan","summary":"The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan[1] from July 1963)[2] is a jet-powered, tailless, delta-wing, high-altitude, strategic bomber, which was operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced, hence the riskiest option. Several reduced-scale aircraft, designated Avro 707s, were produced to test and refine the delta-wing design principles.","image":"XH558_(G-VLCN)_Avro_Vulcan_-_Last_Flight_over_Farnborough_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Avro_Vulcan"}
