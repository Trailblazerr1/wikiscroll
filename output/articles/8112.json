{"title":"CRISPR gene editing","summary":"CRISPR gene editing  (pronounced /ˈkrispər/ \"crisper\") is a genetic engineering technique in molecular biology by which the genomes of living organisms may be modified. It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral defense system. By delivering the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell's genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed and/or new ones added in vivo (in living organisms).[1]","image":"GRNA-Cas9.svg.png.webp","url":"CRISPR_gene_editing"}
