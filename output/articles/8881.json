{"title":"Cataract surgery","summary":"Cataract surgery, also called lens replacement surgery, is the removal of the natural lens of the eye (also called \"crystalline lens\") that has developed an opacification, which is referred to as a cataract,[1] and its replacement with an intraocular lens. Metabolic changes of the crystalline lens fibers over time lead to the development of the cataract, causing impairment or loss of vision. Some infants are born with congenital cataracts, and certain environmental factors may also lead to cataract formation. Early symptoms may include strong glare from lights and small light sources at night, and reduced acuity at low light levels.","image":"Cataract_in_human_eye.png.webp"}
