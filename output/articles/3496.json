{"title":"Anchor tenant","summary":"In retail, an \"anchor tenant\", sometimes called an \"anchor store\", \"draw tenant\", or \"key tenant\", is a considerably larger tenant in a shopping mall, often a department store or retail chain. With their broad appeal, they are intended to attract a significant cross-section of the shopping public to the center. They are often offered steep discounts on rent in exchange for signing long-term leases in order to provide steady cash flows for the mall owners. Some examples of anchor stores in the United States are Macy's, Sears, JCPenney, and Nordstrom.","image":"Nordstrom.JPG.webp","url":"Anchor_tenant"}
