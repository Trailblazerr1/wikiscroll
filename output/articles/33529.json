{"title":"Oxidative phosphorylation","summary":"Oxidative phosphorylation (UK /ɒkˈsɪd.ə.tɪv/, US /ˈɑːk.sɪˌdeɪ.tɪv/ [1]) or electron transport-linked phosphorylation or terminal oxidation is the metabolic pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing chemical energy in order to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is so pervasive because it releases more energy (provided by oxygen) than alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.[2]","image":"Mitochondrial_electron_transport_chain—Etc4.svg.png.webp"}
