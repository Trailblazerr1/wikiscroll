{"title":"Quantitative easing","summary":"Quantitative easing (QE) is a monetary policy whereby a central bank purchases predetermined amounts of government bonds or other financial assets (e.g., municipal bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, etc.) in order to inject money into the economy to expand economic activity.[1] Quantitative easing is considered to be an unconventional form of monetary policy,[2][3] which is usually used when inflation is very low or negative, and when standard monetary policy instruments have become ineffective.","image":"Government-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg.webp"}
