{"title":"Indicator function","summary":"In mathematics, an indicator function or a characteristic function of a subset A of a set X is a function defined from X to the two-element set { 0 , 1 } {\\displaystyle \\{0,1\\}} , typically denoted as 1 A : X â†’ { 0 , 1 } {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}\\colon X\\to \\{0,1\\}} , and it indicates whether an element in X belongs to A; 1 A ( x ) = 1 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)=1} if an element x {\\displaystyle x} in X belongs to A, and 1 A ( x ) = 0 {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)=0} if x {\\displaystyle x} does not belong to A. It is also denoted by I A {\\displaystyle I_{A}} to emphasize the fact that this function identifies the subset A of X.","image":"28de5781698336d21c9c560fb1cbb3fb406923eb.svg","url":"Indicator_function"}
