{"title":"Indicator function","summary":"In mathematics, an indicator function or a characteristic function of a subset A of a set X is a function defined from X to the two-element set \n  \n    \n      \n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\{0,1\\}}\n  \n, typically denoted as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        :\n        X\n        â†’\n        {\n        0\n        ,\n        1\n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}\\colon X\\to \\{0,1\\}}\n  \n, and it indicates whether an element in X belongs to A; \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)=1}\n  \n if an element \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n in X belongs to A, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            A\n          \n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {1} _{A}(x)=0}\n  \n if \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n does not belong to A.
