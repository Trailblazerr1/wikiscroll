{"title":"Flanders","summary":"Flanders (UK: /ˈflɑːndərz/, US: /ˈflæn-/; Dutch: Vlaanderen [ˈvlaːndərə(n)] (listen); French: Flandre [flɑ̃dʁ]; German: Flandern [ˈflandɐn]) is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of Belgium and one of the communities, regions and language areas of Belgium. However, there are several overlapping definitions, including ones related to culture, language, politics, and history, and sometimes involving neighbouring countries. The demonym associated with Flanders is Fleming, while the corresponding adjective is Flemish. The official capital of Flanders is the City of Brussels,[3] although the Brussels-Capital Region has an independent regional government. The government of Flanders only oversees the community aspects of Flanders life in Brussels, such as Flemish culture and education.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
