{"title":"Venom (band)","summary":"Venom are an English extreme metal band formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1978.[1] Coming to prominence towards the end of the new wave of British heavy metal, Venom's first two albums, Welcome to Hell (1981) and Black Metal (1982), are considered major influences on thrash metal and extreme metal in general.[1] Their second album proved influential enough that its title was used as the name of the black metal genre; as a result, Venom were part of the early wave of the genre, along with Mercyful Fate and Bathory.[3]","image":"Venom_at_Party.San_Metal_Open_Air_2013.jpg.webp"}
