{"title":"Antiproton","summary":"The antiproton, p, (pronounced p-bar) is the antiparticle of the proton. Antiprotons are stable, but they are typically short-lived, since any collision with a proton will cause both particles to be annihilated in a burst of energy.","image":"Quark_structure_antiproton.svg.png.webp","url":"Antiproton"}
