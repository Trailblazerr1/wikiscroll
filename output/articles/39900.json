{"title":"Secularity","summary":"Secularity, also the secular or secularness (from Latin Saeculum, \"worldly\" or \"of a generation\"), is the state of being unrelated or neutral in regards to religion and irreligion. Anything that does not have an explicit reference to religion, either negatively or positively, may be considered secular.[1] The process in which things become secular or more so is named secularization, and any concept or ideology promoting the secular may be termed secularism.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Secularity"}
