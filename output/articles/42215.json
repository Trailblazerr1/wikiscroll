{"title":"Stellar corona","summary":"A corona is an aura of plasma that surrounds the Sun and other stars. The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into outer space and is most easily seen during a total solar eclipse, but it is also observable with a coronagraph. Spectroscopy measurements indicate strong ionization in the corona and a plasma temperature in excess of 1000000 kelvin,[1] much hotter than the surface of the Sun.","image":"Solar_eclipse_1999_4.jpg.webp"}
