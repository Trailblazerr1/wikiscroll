{"title":"Sphere","summary":"A sphere (from Greek σφαῖρα—sphaira, \"globe, ball\"[1]) is a geometrical object in three-dimensional space that is the surface of a ball. Like a circle in a two-dimensional space, a sphere is defined mathematically as the set of points that are all at the same distance r from a given point in a three-dimensional space.[2] This distance r is the radius of the ball, which is made up from all points with a distance less than (or, for a closed ball, less than or equal to) r from the given point, which is the center of the mathematical ball. These are also referred to as the radius and center of the sphere, respectively. The longest straight line segment through the ball, connecting two points of the sphere, passes through the center and its length is thus twice the radius; it is a diameter of both the sphere and its ball.","image":"Sphere_wireframe_10deg_6r.svg.png.webp","url":"Sphere"}
