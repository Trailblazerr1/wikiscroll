{"title":"George Carlin","summary":"George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, social critic, and author. Regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics of all time, he was dubbed \"the dean of counterculture comedians\".[1] He was known for his dark comedy and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and taboo subjects. His \"seven dirty words\" routine was central to the 1978 United States Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to censor indecent material on the public airwaves.","image":"George_Carlin_1975_(Little_David_Records)_Publicity.jpg.webp","url":"George_Carlin"}
