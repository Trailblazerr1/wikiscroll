{"title":"Cuban Revolution","summary":"The Cuban Revolution (Spanish: Revolución cubana) was an armed revolt conducted by Fidel Castro and his fellow revolutionaries of the 26th of July Movement and its allies against the military dictatorship of Cuban President Fulgencio Batista. The revolution began in July 1953,[7] and continued sporadically until the rebels finally ousted Batista on 31 December 1958, replacing his government. 26 July 1953 is celebrated in Cuba as the Day of the Revolution (Dia de la Revolución). The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist–Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party of Cuba in October 1965.[8]","image":"Fidel_Castro_and_his_men_in_the_Sierra_Maestra.jpg.webp","url":"Cuban_Revolution"}
