{"title":"Pentito","summary":"Pentito (Italian pronunciation: [penˈtiːto]; lit. \"repentant\"; plural: pentiti) is used colloquially to designate people in Italian criminal procedure terminology who were formerly part of criminal organizations and decided to collaborate with a public prosecutor. The judicial category of pentiti was originally created in 1970s to combat violence and terrorism during the period of left- and right-wing terrorism known as the Years of Lead. During the 1986–87 Maxi Trial, and after the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the term was increasingly applied to former members of organized crime who had abandoned their organization and started helping investigators.","image":"Tommaso_Buscetta.jpg.webp"}
