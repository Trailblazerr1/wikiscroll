{"title":"Newton's law of universal gravitation","summary":"Newton's law of universal gravitation is usually stated as that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.[note 1] The publication of the theory has become known as the \"first great unification\", as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.[1][2][3]","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg"}
