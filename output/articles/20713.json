{"title":"Homo luzonensis","summary":"Homo luzonensis, also locally called \"Ubag\" after a mythical caveman,[2][3] is an extinct, possibly pygmy, species of archaic human from the Late Pleistocene of Luzon, the Philippines. Their remains, teeth and phalanges, are known only from Callao Cave in the northern part of the island dating to before 50,000 years ago. They were initially identified as belonging to modern humans in 2010, but in 2019, after the discovery of more specimens, they were placed into a new species based on the presence of a wide range of traits similar to modern humans as well as to Australopithecus and early Homo.","image":"LuzonensisMolars.jpg.webp","url":"Homo_luzonensis"}
