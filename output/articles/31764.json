{"title":"Neutrino oscillation","summary":"Neutrino oscillation is a quantum mechanical phenomenon in which a neutrino created with a specific lepton family number (\"lepton flavor\": electron, muon, or tau) can later be measured to have a different lepton family number. The probability of measuring a particular flavor for a neutrino varies between three known states, as it propagates through space.[1]","image":"CMS_Higgs-event.jpg.webp"}
