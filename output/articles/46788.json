{"title":"United States v. Lara","summary":"United States v. Lara, 541 U.S. 193 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court landmark case[1] which held that both the United States and a Native American (Indian) tribe could prosecute an Indian for the same acts that constituted crimes in both jurisdictions.  The Court held that the United States and the tribe were separate sovereigns; therefore, separate tribal and federal prosecutions did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.[2]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp","url":"United_States_v._Lara"}
