{"title":"Frontier","summary":"A frontier is the political and geographical area near or beyond a boundary.  A frontier can also be referred to as a \"front\". The term came from French in the 15th century, with the meaning \"borderland\"—the region of a country that fronts on another country (see also marches).  Unlike a border—a rigid and clear-cut form of state boundary[1]—in the most general sense a frontier can be fuzzy or diffuse. For example, the frontier between the Eastern United States and the Old West in the 1800s was an area where European American settlements gradually thinned out and gave way to Native American settlements or uninhabited land.  The frontier was not always a single continuous area, as California and various large cities were populated before the land that connected those to the East.","image":"1800s_Texas_House.JPG.webp"}
