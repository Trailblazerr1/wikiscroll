{"title":"Wetting","summary":"Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. This happens in presence of a gaseous phase or another liquid phase not miscible with the first one. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces.","image":"A_water_droplet_DWR-coated_surface2_edit1.jpg.webp","url":"Wetting"}
