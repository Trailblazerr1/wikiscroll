{"title":"Jeannette expedition","summary":"The Jeannette expedition of 1879â€“1881, officially called the U.S. Arctic Expedition, was an attempt led by George W. De Long to reach the North Pole by pioneering a route from the Pacific Ocean through the Bering Strait. The premise was that a temperate current, the Kuro Siwo, flowed northwards into the strait, providing a gateway to the Open Polar Sea and thus to the pole.","image":"USS_Jeannette%3Bh52199.jpg.webp"}
