{"title":"Ouija","summary":"The ouija (/ˈwiːdʒə/ WEE-jə, /-dʒi/ jee), also known as a spirit board or talking board, is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet, the numbers 0–9, the words \"yes\", \"no\", occasionally \"hello\" and \"goodbye\", along with various symbols and graphics. It uses a planchette (small heart-shaped piece of wood or plastic) as a movable indicator to spell out messages during a séance. Participants place their fingers on the planchette, and it is moved about the board to spell out words. \"Ouija\" is a trademark of Hasbro,[1] but is often used generically to refer to any talking board.","image":"Ouija_board_-_Kennard_Novelty_Company.png.webp"}
