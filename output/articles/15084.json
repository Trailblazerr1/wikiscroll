{"title":"Erinyes","summary":"The Erinyes (/ɪˈrɪniˌiːz/; sing. Erinys /ɪˈrɪnɪs/, /ɪˈraɪnɪs/;[1] Greek: Ἐρινύες, pl. of Ἐρινύς, Erinys),[2] also known as the Furies, were female chthonic deities of vengeance in ancient Greek religion and mythology. A formulaic oath in the Iliad invokes them as \"the Erinyes, that under earth take vengeance on men, whosoever hath sworn a false oath\".[3] Walter Burkert suggests they are \"an embodiment of the act of self-cursing contained in the oath\".[4] They correspond to the Dirae in Roman mythology.[5] The Roman writer Maurus Servius Honoratus wrote (ca. 600 AD) that they are called \"Eumenides\" in hell, \"Furiae\" on earth, and \"Dirae\" in heaven.[6][7]","image":"Klytaimnestra_Erinyes_Louvre_Cp710.jpg.webp","url":"Erinyes"}
