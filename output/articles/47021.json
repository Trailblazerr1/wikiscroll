{"title":"Vacuum permittivity","summary":"Vacuum permittivity, commonly denoted Îµ0 (pronounced as \"epsilon nought\" or \"epsilon zero\") is the value of the absolute dielectric permittivity of classical vacuum. Alternatively  may be referred to as the permittivity of free space, the electric constant, or the distributed capacitance of the vacuum. It is an ideal (baseline) physical constant. Its CODATA value is:","image":"b4c4dac9e91c7f1d383437a501121518aa0eecdd.svg","url":"Vacuum_permittivity"}
