{"title":"Subsistence agriculture","summary":"Subsistence agriculture occurs when farmers grow food crops to meet the needs of themselves and their families on smallholdings.[1] Subsistence agriculturalists target farm output for survival and for mostly local requirements, with little or no surplus. Planting decisions occur principally with an eye toward what the family will need during the coming year, and only secondarily toward market prices.[1] Tony Waters, a professor of sociology, defines \"subsistence peasants\" as \"people who grow what they eat, build their own houses, and live without regularly making purchases in the marketplace.\"[2]:â€Š2","image":"Bakweri_cocoyam_farmer_from_Cameroon.jpg.webp","url":"Subsistence_agriculture"}
