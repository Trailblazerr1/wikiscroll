{"title":"Tor (network)","summary":"Tor, short for The Onion Router, is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication.[6] It directs Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer overlay network, consisting of more than six thousand relays,[7] for concealing a user's location and usage from anyone conducting network surveillance or traffic analysis. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace the Internet activity to the user. Tor's intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.","image":"Tor-logo-2011-flat.svg.png.webp","url":"Tor_(network)"}
