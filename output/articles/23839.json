{"title":"John the Apostle","summary":"John the Apostle[6] (Ancient Greek: Ἰωάννης; Latin: Ioannes[7] c. 6 AD – c. 100 AD) or Saint John the Beloved was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. Generally listed as the youngest apostle, he was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother was James, who was another of the Twelve Apostles. The Church Fathers identify him as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder and the Beloved Disciple, and testify that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one to die of natural causes. The traditions of most Christian denominations have held that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament.","image":"Rubens_apostel_johannes_grt.jpg.webp","url":"John_the_Apostle"}
