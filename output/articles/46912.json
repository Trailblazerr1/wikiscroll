{"title":"Uremia","summary":"Uremia is the condition of having high levels of urea in the blood. Urea is one of the primary components of urine. It can be defined as an excess of amino acid and protein metabolism end products, such as urea and creatinine, in the blood that would be normally excreted in the urine. Uremic syndrome can be defined as the terminal clinical manifestation of kidney failure (also called renal failure).[1] It is the signs, symptoms and results from laboratory tests which result from inadequate excretory, regulatory, and endocrine function of the kidneys.[2] Both uremia and uremic syndrome have been used interchangeably to denote a very high plasma urea concentration that is the result of renal failure.[1] The former denotation will be used for the rest of the article.","image":"Uremic_frost_on_forehead_and_scalp_of_young_Afro-Caribbean_male.jpg.webp"}
