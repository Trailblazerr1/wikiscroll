{"title":"Everytime","summary":"\"Everytime\" is a song by American singer Britney Spears for her fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). It was released on April 21, 2004, by Jive Records as the third single from the album. After her relationship with singer Justin Timberlake ended in 2002, Spears became friends with her background singer Annet Artani. They started writing songs together at Spears' house in Los Angeles, and then traveled to Lombardy, Italy, where they collaborated on \"Everytime\". Spears composed the music herself and developed the lyrics with Artani. According to Artani, the song was written as a response to Timberlake's 2002 song \"Cry Me a River\", which Spears has neither confirmed nor denied.","image":"Everytime.png.webp","url":"Everytime"}
