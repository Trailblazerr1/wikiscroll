{"title":"Jean Lafitte","summary":"Jean Lafitte (c. 1780 – c. 1823) was a French pirate and privateer who operated in the Gulf of Mexico in the early 19th century. He and his older brother Pierre spelled their last name Laffite, but English language documents of the time used \"Lafitte\". This has become the common spelling in the United States, including places named after him.[1]","image":"Anonymous_portrait_of_Jean_Lafitte%2C_early_19th_century%2C_Rosenberg_Library%2C_Galveston%2C_Texas.JPG.webp","url":"Jean_Lafitte"}
