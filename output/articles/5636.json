{"title":"Baroque pop","summary":"Baroque pop (sometimes called baroque rock) is a fusion genre that combines rock music with particular elements of classical music.[4][2][3] It emerged in the mid 1960s as artists pursued a majestic, orchestral sound[2] and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles (contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns) and dramatic or melancholic gestures.[1] Harpsichords figure prominently,[5] while oboes, French horns, and string quartets are also common.[3]","image":"Harp02.jpg.webp","url":"Baroque_pop"}
