{"title":"Electric field","summary":"An electric field (sometimes E-field[1]) is the physical field that surrounds electrically-charged particles and exerts force on all other charged particles in the field, either attracting or repelling them.[2] It also refers to the physical field for a system of charged particles.[3] Electric fields originate from electric charges, or from time-varying magnetic fields. Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces (or interactions) of nature.","image":"Van_de_Graaff_Generator_-_Science_City_-_Calcutta_1997_444.JPG.webp","url":"Electric_field"}
