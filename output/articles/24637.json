{"title":"Ketamine","summary":"Ketamine is a medication primarily used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It induces dissociative anesthesia, a trance-like state providing pain relief, sedation, and amnesia.[19] The distinguishing features of ketamine anesthesia are preserved breathing and airway reflexes, stimulated heart function with increased blood pressure, and moderate bronchodilation.[19] At lower, sub-anesthetic doses, ketamine is a promising agent for pain and treatment-resistant depression.[20] However, the antidepressant action of a single administration of ketamine wanes with time, and the effects of repeated use have not been sufficiently studied.[21][22][23]","image":"Ketamine2DCSD.svg.png.webp","url":"Ketamine"}
