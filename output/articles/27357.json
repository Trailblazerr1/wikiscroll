{"title":"Lorentz force","summary":"In physics (specifically in electromagnetism) the Lorentz force (or electromagnetic force) is the combination of electric and magnetic force on a point charge due to electromagnetic fields. A particle of charge q moving with a velocity v in an electric field E and a magnetic field B experiences a force of","image":"0ea6ba54d51be5241b3b110e3bdc8d537744db05.svg","url":"Lorentz_force"}
