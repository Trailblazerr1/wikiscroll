{"title":"Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary","summary":"The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary, formerly known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary (K-T) boundary,[lower-alpha 1] is a geological signature, usually a thin band of rock. The K–Pg boundary marks the end of the Cretaceous Period, the last period of the Mesozoic Era, and marks the beginning of the Paleogene period, the first period of the Cenozoic Era. Its age is usually estimated at around 66 million years,[2] with radiometric dating yielding a more precise age of 66.043 ± 0.011 Ma.[3]","image":"KT_boundary_054.jpg.webp"}
