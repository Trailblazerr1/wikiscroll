{"title":"Flag of France","summary":"The flag of France (French: drapeau français) is a tricolour flag featuring three vertical bands coloured blue (hoist side), white, and red. It is known to English speakers as the French Tricolour, or simply the Tricolour (French: Tricolore), although the flag of Ireland and others are also so known. The design was adopted after the French Revolution; while not the first tricolour, it became one of the most influential flags in history. The tricolour scheme was later adopted by many other nations in Europe and elsewhere, and, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica has historically stood \"in symbolic opposition to the autocratic and clericalist royal standards of the past\".","image":"Flag_of_France_(1794–1815%2C_1830–1958).svg.png.webp","url":"Flag_of_France"}
