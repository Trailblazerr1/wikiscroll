{"title":"Cache (computing)","summary":"In computing, a cache (/kæʃ/ (listen) kash,[1] or /ˈkeɪʃ/ kaysh in Australian English[2]) is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.  A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it cannot.  Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.[3]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
