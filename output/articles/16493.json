{"title":"Floppy disk","summary":"A floppy disk or floppy diskette (sometimes casually referred to as a floppy or diskette) is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk. Floppy disks store digital data[nb 1] which can be read and written when the disk is inserted into a floppy disk drive (FDD) connected to or inside a computer or other device.","image":"Floppy_disk_2009_G1.jpg.webp"}
