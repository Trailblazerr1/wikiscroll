{"title":"Cryptographic hash function","summary":"A cryptographic hash function (CHF) is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of an arbitrary size (often called the \"message\") to a bit array of a fixed size (the \"hash value\", \"hash\", or \"message digest\"). It is a one-way function, that is, a function for which it is practically infeasible to invert or reverse the computation.[1] Ideally, the only way to find a message that produces a given hash is to attempt a brute-force search of possible inputs to see if they produce a match, or use a rainbow table of matched hashes. Cryptographic hash functions are a basic tool of modern cryptography.","image":"Cryptographic_Hash_Function.svg.png.webp","url":"Cryptographic_hash_function"}
