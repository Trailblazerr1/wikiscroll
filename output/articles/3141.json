{"title":"Amanita phalloides","summary":"Amanita phalloides (/æməˈnaɪtə fəˈlɔɪdiːz/), commonly known as the death cap or death cup,[1] is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus, one of many in the genus Amanita. Widely distributed across Europe, but now sprouting in other parts of the world, A. phalloides forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe and gills. The cap colour is variable, including white forms, and is thus not a reliable identifier.","image":"Amanita_phalloides_1.JPG.webp","url":"Amanita_phalloides"}
