{"title":"Romani language","summary":"Romani (/ˈrɒməni, ˈroʊ-/;[13][14][15][16] also Romany, Romanes /ˈrɒmənɪs/,[17] Roma, Gypsy; Romani: rromani ćhib) is an Indo-Aryan macrolanguage of the Romani communities.[18] According to Ethnologue, seven varieties of Romani are divergent enough to be considered languages of their own. The largest of these are Vlax Romani (about 500,000 speakers),[19] Balkan Romani (600,000),[20] and Sinte Romani (300,000).[21] Some Romani communities speak mixed languages based on the surrounding language with retained Romani-derived vocabulary – these are known by linguists as Para-Romani varieties, rather than dialects of the Romani language itself.[22]","image":"Flag_of_Austria.svg.png.webp"}
