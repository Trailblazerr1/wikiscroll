{"title":"Flowering plant","summary":"Flowering plants include multiple members of the clade Angiospermae (/ˌændʒiəˈspɜːrmiː/),[5][6] commonly called angiosperms. The term \"angiosperm\" is derived from the Greek words angeion ('container, vessel') and sperma ('seed'), and refers to those plants that produce their seeds enclosed within a fruit. They are the most diverse group of land plants with 64 orders, 416 families, approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species.[7] Angiosperms were formerly called Magnoliophyta (/mæɡˌnoʊliˈɒfətə, -əˈfaɪtə/).[8]","image":"Flower_poster_2.jpg.webp"}
