{"title":"Summer solstice","summary":"The summer solstice, also known as estival solstice[3] or midsummer, occurs when one of Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky (for areas outside of the tropics) and is the day with the longest period of daylight. Within the Arctic circle (for the northern hemisphere) or Antarctic circle (for the southern hemisphere), there is continuous daylight around the summer solstice. On the summer solstice, Earth's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44°.[4] Likewise, the Sun's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44°.","image":"Himawari-8_Summer_Solstice_Midnight_2017.jpg.webp"}
