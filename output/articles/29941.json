{"title":"Milgram experiment","summary":"The Milgram experiment(s) on obedience to authority figures was a series of social psychology experiments conducted by Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. They measured the willingness of study participants, men 20â€“50 years old from a diverse range of occupations with varying levels of education, to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts conflicting with their personal conscience. Participants were led to believe that they were assisting an unrelated experiment, in which they had to administer electric shocks to a \"learner\". These fake electric shocks gradually increased to levels that would have been fatal had they been real.[2]","image":"Milgram_experiment_v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Milgram_experiment"}
