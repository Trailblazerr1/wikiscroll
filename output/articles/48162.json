{"title":"Weezer (Red Album)","summary":"Weezer, also known as the Red Album, is the sixth studio album and third self-titled album by American rock band Weezer, released on June 3, 2008 by DGC and Interscope Records.[2] Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee both produced parts of the album, with the band producing a handful of tracks themselves.[3] Like their 1994 debut, other band members contributed to songwriting. This is the first and, so far, the only Weezer album to feature lead vocals from all four band members. The album also features more musical experimentation in comparison to their previous efforts, especially shown in such songs as \"Dreamin'\", \"The Angel and The One\", and \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\".","image":"Weezerred2.jpg.webp","url":"Weezer_(Red_Album)"}
