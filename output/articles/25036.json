{"title":"Korean wave","summary":"The Korean wave or K wave (Korean: 한류; Hanja: 韓流; RR: Hallyu; MR: Hallyu, listen , a neologism, literally meaning \"wave/flow of Korea\") is the increase in global popularity of South Korean culture since the 1990s.[1][2][3] First driven by the spread of K-dramas and K-pop across East, Southeast and South Asia during its initial stages, the Korean Wave evolved from a regional development into a global phenomenon, carried by the Internet and social media and the proliferation of K-pop music videos on YouTube.[4][5][6][7][8] While some sources attribute the term Hallyu, a variation of a Japanese expression using Ryu (流) as a postfix to refer ‘～way’, ‘~style’, ‘～group’,[9] to being first used by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in South Korea in 1999, when the ministry produced a music CD titled in Chinese 韓流—Song from Korea; other scholarly sources attribute the term's ascendance from Korean television dramas first airing on Chinese television in 1997, naming the phenomenon hanliu (simplified Chinese: 韩流; traditional Chinese: 韓流; pinyin: Hánliú), meaning \"Korean wave\".[10] The term was adopted by Chinese media to refer to the success of South Korean popular culture in China.[11] The term was reintroduced in Japan as hanryu or kanryu by the Asahi Shimbun in 2001.[12] These two words, hallyu and Korean wave, were officially included in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2021.[13]","image":"Korean_Cabbage_Kimchi.jpg.webp","url":"Korean_wave"}
