{"title":"2014 celebrity nude photo leak","summary":"On August 31, 2014, a collection of almost 500 private pictures of various celebrities, mostly women, with many containing nudity, were posted on the imageboard 4chan, and later disseminated by other users on websites and social networks such as Imgur and Reddit. The leak has been popularly dubbed The Fappening and also Celebgate. The images were initially believed to have been obtained via a breach of Apple's cloud services suite iCloud,[1][2] or a security issue in the iCloud API which allowed them to make unlimited attempts at guessing victims' passwords.[3][4] Apple claimed in a press release that access was gained via spear phishing attacks.[5][6]","image":"MLB_All-Star_Red_Carpet_Parade_(48266260657).jpg.webp"}
