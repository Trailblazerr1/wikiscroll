{"title":"Duryodhana","summary":"Duryodhana (Sanskrit: दुर्योधन, IAST: Duryodhana) also known as Suyodhana, is the main antagonist in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. He was the eldest of the Kauravas, the hundred sons of the blind king Dhritarashtra and his queen Gandhari. Being the firstborn son of the blind king, he was the crown prince of Kuru Kingdom and its capital Hastinapura; along with his cousin Yudhishtra who was older than him. Karna was Duryodhana's closest friend. Notably, Duryodhana, with significant assistance from Karna, performs Vaishnava Yagna when the Pandavas are in exile.[1][2] Duryodhana used his greater skill in wielding the mace to defeat opponents.  He was also an extremely courageous warrior and he was said to be a good ruler. Duryodhana's greed and arrogance were the two qualities said to lead to his downfall in the Mahabharata. Suyodhana got the armour of shive from birth which made him invincible to all weapons.","image":"Duryodhana_showing_his_army_to_Drona.jpg.webp","url":"Duryodhana"}
