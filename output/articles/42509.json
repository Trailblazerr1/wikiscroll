{"title":"Stroke","summary":"A stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to the brain causes cell death.[5] There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding.[5] Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.[5] Signs and symptoms of a stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side.[2][3] Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred.[3] If symptoms last less than one or two hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a  mini-stroke.[3] A hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache.[3] The symptoms of a stroke can be permanent.[5] Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.[3]","image":"MCA_Territory_Infarct.svg.png.webp","url":"Stroke"}
