{"title":"The Holocaust in Albania","summary":"The Holocaust in Albania consisted of crimes committed against Jews in Albania by German, Italian, and Albanian collaborationist forces while Albania was under Italian and German occupation during World War II. Throughout the war, nearly 2,000 Jews sought refuge in Albania-proper. Most of these Jewish refugees were treated well by the local population, despite the fact that Albania-proper was occupied first by Fascist Italy, and then by Nazi Germany. Albanians often sheltered Jewish refugees in mountain villages and transported them to Adriatic ports from where they fled to Italy. Other Jews joined resistance movements throughout the country.","image":"Map_of_Albania_during_WWII.png.webp","url":"The_Holocaust_in_Albania"}
