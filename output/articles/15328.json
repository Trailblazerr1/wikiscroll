{"title":"Euro sign","summary":"The euro sign, €, is the currency sign used for the euro, the official currency of the eurozone and some other countries (such as Kosovo and Montenegro). The design was presented to the public by the European Commission on 12 December 1996. It consists of a stylized letter E (or epsilon), crossed by two lines instead of one. In English, the sign immediately precedes the value (for instance, €10); in most other European languages, it follows the value, usually but not always with an intervening space (for instance, 10 €, 10€).","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
