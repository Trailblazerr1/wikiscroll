{"title":"Transpiration","summary":"Transpiration is the process of water movement through a plant and its evaporation from aerial parts, such as leaves, stems and flowers. Water is necessary for plants but only a small amount of water taken up by the roots is used for growth and metabolism.  The remaining 97â€“99.5% is lost by transpiration and guttation.[1] Leaf surfaces are dotted with pores called stomata (singular \"stoma\"), and in most plants they are more numerous on the undersides of the foliage. The stomata are bordered by guard cells and their stomatal accessory cells (together known as stomatal complex) that open and close the pore.[2] Transpiration occurs through the  stomatal apertures, and can be thought of as a necessary \"cost\" associated with the opening of the stomata to allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide gas from the air for photosynthesis. Transpiration also cools plants, changes osmotic pressure of cells, and enables mass flow of mineral nutrients and water from roots to shoots. Two major factors influence the rate of water flow from the soil to the roots: the hydraulic conductivity of the soil and the magnitude of the pressure gradient through the soil. Both of these factors influence the rate of bulk flow of water moving from the roots to the stomatal pores in the leaves via the xylem.[3]","image":"Transpiration_Overview.svg.png.webp","url":"Transpiration"}
