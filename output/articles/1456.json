{"title":"Professional wrestling","summary":"Professional wrestling is a form of  performing art involving wrestling matches whose progress and outcome are planned in advance, typically between performers with established character roles. Professional wrestling is not to be confused with the contact sports of amateur wrestling.[1] The wrestling matches are based on classical and \"catch\" wrestling, with modern additions of striking attacks, acrobatics, feats of strength, fast-moving athleticism and occasionally, improvised weaponry.[2] Professional wrestling also liberally incorporates melodrama. Much like some of the real prizefighters they imitate, the characters in professional wrestling have large egos, flamboyant personalities (often attached to a gimmick), and turbulent interpersonal relationships. These personas are scripted much like the matches. Performances mainly take place in a ring similar to the kind used in boxing.[3] In televised wrestling shows, many additional \"backstage\" scenes are also recorded to supplement the drama in the ring.[4]","image":"Wrestling_-_Sikeston%2C_MO_1938_-_1.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fProfessional_wrestling"}
