Taking place a century after the original Mega Man series, Mega Man X is set in a futuristic world populated by both humans and \"Reploids\", robots capable of thinking, feeling, and growing like their human creators. Because of these complex attributes, many Reploids are prone to destructive, renegade activity and are thereafter referred to as \"Mavericks\". The plot of the game follows the protagonist Mega Man X, an android member of a military task force called the \"Maverick Hunters\". With the help of his partner Zero, X must thwart the plans of Sigma, a powerful Maverick leader wishing to bring about human extinction.","image":"Mega_Man_X_Coverart.png.webp","url":"Mega_Man_X_(video_game)"}
