{"title":"Organic reaction","summary":"Organic reactions are chemical reactions involving organic compounds.[1][2][3] The basic organic chemistry reaction types are addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions, photochemical reactions and redox reactions. In organic synthesis, organic reactions are used in the construction of new organic molecules. The production of many man-made chemicals such as drugs, plastics, food additives, fabrics depend on organic reactions.","image":"Claisen_Rearrangement_Scheme.png.webp","url":"Organic_reaction"}
