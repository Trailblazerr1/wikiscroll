{"title":"European badger","summary":"The European badger (Meles meles) is a badger species in the family Mustelidae native to almost all of Europe. It is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List as it has a wide range and a large stable population size, and is thought to be increasing in some regions. Several subspecies are recognized with the nominate subspecies (M. m. meles) predominating in most of Europe.[1] In Europe, where no other badger species commonly occurs, it is generally just called the \"badger\".","image":"Mäyrä_Ähtäri_4.jpg.webp","url":"European_badger"}
