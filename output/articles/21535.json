{"title":"Ice skating","summary":"Ice skating is the self-propulsion and gliding of a person across an ice surface, using metal-bladed ice skates. People skate for various reasons, including recreation (fun), exercise, competitive sports, and commuting. Ice skating may be performed on naturally frozen bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers; and on man-made ice surfaces such as ice rinks, ice hockey rinks, and arenas, both indoors and outdoors.","image":"Skating%2C_man%2C_woman%2C_ice-skating_rink%2C_winter%2C_smile%2C_free_time_Fortepan_14348.jpg.webp"}
