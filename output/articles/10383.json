{"title":"Coat of arms of Mexico","summary":"The coat of arms of Mexico (Spanish: Escudo Nacional de MÃ©xico, literally \"national shield of Mexico\") depicts a Mexican (golden) eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus devouring a rattlesnake.[1] The design is rooted in the legend that the Aztec people would know where to build their city once they saw an eagle eating a snake on top of a lake.[1] The image has been an important symbol of Mexican politics and culture for centuries.  To the people of Tenochtitlan, this symbol had strong religious connotations, and to the Europeans, it came to symbolize the triumph of good over evil (with the snake sometimes representative of the serpent in the Garden of Eden).","image":"Coat_of_arms_of_Mexico.svg.png.webp","url":"Coat_of_arms_of_Mexico"}
