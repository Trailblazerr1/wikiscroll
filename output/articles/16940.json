{"title":"Freddie Mac","summary":"The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), commonly known as Freddie Mac, is a publicly traded,  government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia.[3][4] The FHLMC was created in 1970 to expand the secondary market for mortgages in the US. Along with the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), Freddie Mac buys mortgages, pools them, and sells them as a mortgage-backed security (MBS) to private investors on the open market. This secondary mortgage market increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases. The name \"Freddie Mac\" is a variant of the FHLMC initialism of the company's full name that was adopted officially for ease of identification.","image":"Freddie_Mac.svg.png.webp","url":"Freddie_Mac"}
