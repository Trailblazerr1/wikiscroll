{"title":"Cave Story","summary":"Cave Story, originally released as D≈çkutsu Monogatari,[lower-alpha 2] is a 2004 Metroidvania[1] platform-adventure game for Microsoft Windows. It was developed over five years by Japanese developer Daisuke \"Pixel\" Amaya in his free time. Cave Story features 2D platform mechanics and is reminiscent of the games Amaya played in his youth, such as Metroid and Castlevania (both released in 1986). After its initial self-published release, the game slowly gained popularity on the internet. It received widespread critical acclaim for many polished aspects of its design, such as its compelling characters, setting, story, and gameplay. Cave Story is considered by many as the quintessential indie game because of its one-person development team and influence on the gaming world.[2][3]","image":"Cave_Story_title_screen.png.webp","url":"Cave_Story"}
