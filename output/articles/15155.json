{"title":"Esperanto","summary":"Esperanto (/ˌɛspəˈrɑːntoʊ/ or /ˌɛspəˈræntoʊ/)[4][5] is the world's most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language. Created by Polish ophthalmologist L. L. Zamenhof in 1887, it was intended to be a universal second language for international communication. Zamenhof first described the language in Dr. Esperanto's International Language, which he published in five languages under the pseudonym \"Doktoro Esperanto.\" He claimed that the grammar of the language could be learned in one hour, though this estimate assumed a learner with a background in European languages. The word esperanto translates into English as \"one who hopes.\"[6]","image":"Flag_of_Esperanto.svg.png.webp"}
