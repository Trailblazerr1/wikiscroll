{"title":"Hand fan","summary":"A handheld fan, or simply hand fan, may be any broad, flat surface that is waved back-and-forth to create an airflow. Generally, purpose-made handheld fans are folding fans, which are shaped like a sector of a circle and made of a thin material (such as paper or feathers) mounted on slats which revolve around a pivot so that it can be closed when not in use.","image":"Brise_Fan_LACMA_M.78.108.10.jpg.webp","url":"Hand_fan"}
