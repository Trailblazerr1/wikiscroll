The term is derived from the Greek stems poly (Greek: \"πολύ\") meaning \"many\" and kephalē (Greek: \"κεφαλή\") meaning \"head\". A polycephalic organism may be thought of as one being with a supernumerary body part, or as two or more beings with a shared body.","image":"Gustave_Moreau_003.jpg.webp","url":"Polycephaly"}
