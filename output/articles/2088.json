{"title":"Action (firearms)","summary":"In firearms terminology, an action is the functional mechanism of a breech-loading firearm that handles (loads, locks, fires, extracts and ejects) the ammunition cartridges, or the method by which that mechanism works.[1]  Actions are technically not present on muzzleloaders, as all those are single-shot firearms with a closed off breech with the powder and projectile manually loaded from the muzzle.  Instead, the muzzleloader ignition mechanism is referred to as the lock (e.g. matchlock, flintlock, caplock).","image":"ShotgunAction.JPG.webp"}
