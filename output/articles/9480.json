{"title":"Chemoreceptor","summary":"A chemoreceptor, also known as chemosensor, is a specialized sensory receptor cell which transduces a chemical substance (endogenous or induced) to generate a biological signal.[1] This signal may be in the form of an action potential, if the chemoreceptor is a neuron,[2] or in the form of a neurotransmitter that can activate a nerve fiber if the chemoreceptor is a specialized cell, such as taste receptors,[3] or an internal peripheral chemoreceptor, such as the carotid bodies.[4] In physiology, a chemoreceptor detects changes in the normal environment, such as an increase in blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) or a decrease in blood levels of oxygen (hypoxia), and transmits that information to the central nervous system which engages body responses to restore homeostasis.","image":"Wikisource-logo.svg.png.webp"}
