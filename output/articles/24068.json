{"title":"Judeo-Christian","summary":"The term Judeo-Christian is used to group Christianity and Judaism together, either in reference to Christianity's derivation from Judaism, Christianity's borrowing of Jewish Scripture (the Hebrew Bible) to constitute the \"Old Testament\" of the Christian Bible, or due to perceived parallels or commonalities in Judaeo-Christian ethics shared by the two religions, such as the 10 commandments. The Jewish Tradition of atonement has been borrowed by Christians and circumcision is a common Jewish tradition among Evangelicals.[1][2]","image":"Wikiquote-logo.svg.png.webp"}
