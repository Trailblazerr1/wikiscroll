{"title":"Projection (linear algebra)","summary":"In linear algebra and functional analysis, a projection is a linear transformation \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  \n from a vector space to itself (an endomorphism) such that \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        âˆ˜\n        P\n        =\n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P\\circ P=P}\n  \n. That is, whenever \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  \n is applied twice to any vector, it gives the same result as if it were applied once (i.e. \n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n  \n is idempotent). It leaves its image unchanged.[1] This definition of \"projection\" formalizes and generalizes the idea of graphical projection.  One can also consider the effect of a projection on a geometrical object by examining the effect of the projection on points in the object.","image":"b4dc73bf40314945ff376bd363916a738548d40a.svg"}
