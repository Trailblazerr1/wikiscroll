{"title":"Son of Beast","summary":"Son of Beast was a record-breaking wooden roller coaster located at Kings Island in Mason, Ohio. Built and designed by the now-defunct Roller Coaster Corporation of America, it opened to the public on April 28, 2000, and was themed as a sequel to one of the park's other signature attractions, The Beast.[1] In addition to breaking the world record for speed, Son of Beast was the first wooden hypercoaster in the world with a 214-foot (65Â m) drop and was the second wooden coaster to feature an inversion; Flip Flap Railway was the first, but was long defunct before the ride's opening.","image":"PKI-Son_of_Beast.jpg.webp","url":"Son_of_Beast"}
