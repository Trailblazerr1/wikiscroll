{"title":"Structural history of the Roman military","summary":"The structural history of the Roman military concerns the major transformations in the organization and constitution of ancient Rome's armed forces, \"the most effective and long-lived military institution known to history.\"[1] From its origins around 800 BC to its final dissolution in AD 476 with the demise of the Western Roman Empire, Rome's military organization underwent substantial structural change. At the highest level of structure, the forces were split into the Roman army and the Roman navy, although these two branches were less distinct than in many modern national defense forces. Within the top levels of both army and navy, structural changes occurred as a result of both positive military reform and organic structural evolution. These changes can be divided into four distinct phases.","image":"Roman_Military_banner.svg.png.webp","url":"Structural_history_of_the_Roman_military"}
