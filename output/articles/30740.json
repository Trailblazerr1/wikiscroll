{"title":"Mu'awiya I","summary":"Mu'awiya I (Arabic: معاوية بن أبي سفيان‎, romanized: Muʿāwiya ibn Abī Sufyān; c. 597, 603 or 605–April 680) was the founder and first caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, serving from 661 until his death. He became caliph less than thirty years after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and immediately after the four Rashidun ('rightly-guided') caliphs. Unlike his predecessors, who had been close, early companions of Muhammad, Mu'awiya was a relatively late follower of the Islamic prophet.","image":"Age_of_the_Caliphs-recolored.png.webp","url":"Mu'awiya_I"}
