{"title":"Loudspeaker","summary":"A loudspeaker (or speaker driver, or most frequently just speaker) is an electroacoustic transducer,[1] that is, a device that converts an electrical audio signal into a corresponding sound.[2] A speaker system, also often simply referred to as a \"speaker\" or \"loudspeaker\", comprises one or more such speaker drivers (above definition), an enclosure, and electrical connections possibly including a crossover network. The speaker driver can be viewed as a linear motor attached to a diaphragm which couples that motor's movement to motion of air, that is, sound. An audio signal, typically from a microphone, recording, or radio broadcast,  is amplified electronically to a power level capable of driving that motor in order to reproduce the sound corresponding to the original unamplified electronic signal. This is thus the opposite function to the  microphone, and indeed the dynamic speaker driver, by far the most common type, is a linear motor in the same basic configuration as the dynamic microphone which uses such a motor in reverse, as a generator.","image":"Electrodynamic-loudspeaker.png.webp"}
