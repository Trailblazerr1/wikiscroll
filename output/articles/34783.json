{"title":"Philip W. Anderson","summary":"Philip Warren Anderson ForMemRS HonFInstP (December 13, 1923 â€“ March 29, 2020) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate. Anderson made contributions to the theories of localization, antiferromagnetism, symmetry breaking (including a paper in 1962 discussing symmetry breaking in particle physics, leading to the development of the Standard Model around 10 years later), and high-temperature superconductivity, and to the philosophy of science through his writings on emergent phenomena.[3][4][5][6][7] Anderson is also responsible for naming the field of physics that is now known as condensed matter physics.[8]","image":"Andersonphoto.jpg.webp","url":"Philip_W._Anderson"}
