{"title":"Conatus","summary":"In early philosophies of psychology and metaphysics, conatus (/koʊˈneɪtəs/;[1] Latin for \"effort; endeavor; impulse, inclination, tendency; undertaking; striving\") is an innate inclination of a thing to continue to exist and enhance itself.[2] This \"thing\" may be mind, matter, or a combination of both. Over the millennia, many different definitions and treatments have been formulated, including seventeenth-century philosophers René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Gottfried Leibniz, and Thomas Hobbes who had made significant contributions.[3]  The conatus may refer to the instinctive \"will to live\" of living organisms or to various metaphysical theories of motion and inertia.[4] Often the concept is associated with God's will in a pantheist view of Nature.[3][5] The concept may be broken up into separate definitions for the mind and body and split when discussing centrifugal force and inertia.[6]","image":"CiceroBust.jpg.webp"}
