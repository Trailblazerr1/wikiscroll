{"title":"Ivan Lendl","summary":"Ivan Lendl (Czech pronunciation: [ˈɪvan ˈlɛndl̩]; born March 7, 1960) is a Czech-American former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 for 270 weeks and won 94 singles titles. He won eight Grand Slam titles and was runner-up a joint record 11 times (tied with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic), making him the first male player to appear in 19 Grand Slam finals. He also appeared in a record eight consecutive US Open finals, and won seven year-end championships. Lendl pioneered a new style of tennis; his game was built around his forehand, hit hard with heavy topspin, and his success is cited as a primary influence in popularizing the currently common playing style of aggressive baseline power tennis.[3][4] After retirement, he became a tennis coach for many players. In particular, he helped Andy Murray win three major titles and reach the No. 1 ranking.","image":"Ivan_Lendl.jpg.webp","url":"Ivan_Lendl"}
