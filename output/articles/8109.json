{"title":"CPU cache","summary":"A CPU cache is a hardware cache used by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer to reduce the average cost (time or energy) to access data from the main memory.[1] A cache is a smaller, faster memory, located closer to a processor core, which stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations.  Most CPUs have a hierarchy of multiple cache levels (L1, L2, often L3, and rarely even L4), with separate instruction-specific and data-specific caches at level 1.","image":"NeXTcube_motherboard.jpg.webp","url":"CPU_cache"}
