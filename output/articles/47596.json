{"title":"Visible spectrum","summary":"The visible spectrum or optical spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 to about 750 nanometers.[1] In terms of frequency, this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 400–790 THz. These boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual.[2] Under optimal conditions these limits of human perception can extend to 310 nm (UV) and 1100 nm (NIR).[3][4]","image":"Light_dispersion_of_a_mercury-vapor_lamp_with_a_flint_glass_prism_IPNr°0125.jpg.webp"}
