{"title":"Iridescence","summary":"Iridescence (also known as goniochromism) is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear to gradually change color as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. Examples of iridescence include soap bubbles, feathers, butterfly wings and seashell nacre, as well as certain minerals. It is often created by structural coloration (microstructures that interfere with light).","image":"Soap_Bubble_-_foliage_background_-_iridescent_colours_-_Traquair_040801.jpg.webp"}
