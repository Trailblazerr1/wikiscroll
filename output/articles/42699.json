{"title":"Sultanate of Rum","summary":"The Sultanate of Rum[lower-alpha 1] or Rum Seljuk Sultanate (Persian: سلجوقیان روم‎, romanized: Saljuqiyān-e Rum, lit. 'Seljuks of Rome') was a Turko-Persian[7][8][9][10] Sunni Muslim ruled state, established over conquered Byzantine territories and peoples (Rûm) of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks following their entry into Anatolia after the Battle of Manzikert (1071). The name Rûm was a synonym for the medieval Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire and its peoples, as it remains in modern Turkish. It derives from the Arabic name for ancient Rome, الرُّومُ ar-Rūm via a loan from Koine Greek Ῥωμαῖοι, \"Romans, citizens of the Eastern Roman Empire\".[11]","image":"SelcukluKartali2.png.webp","url":"Sultanate_of_Rum"}
