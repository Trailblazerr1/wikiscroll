{"title":"Self-adjoint operator","summary":"In mathematics, a self-adjoint operator on an infinite-dimensional complex vector space V with inner product \n  \n    \n      \n        ⟨\n        ⋅\n        ,\n        ⋅\n        ⟩\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\langle \\cdot ,\\cdot \\rangle }\n  \n (equivalently, a Hermitian operator in the finite-dimensional case) is a linear map A (from V to itself) that is its own adjoint. If V is finite-dimensional with a given orthonormal basis, this is equivalent to the condition that the matrix of A is a Hermitian matrix, i.e., equal to its conjugate transpose A∗. By the finite-dimensional spectral theorem, V has an orthonormal basis such that the matrix of A relative to this basis is a diagonal matrix with entries in the real numbers. In this article, we consider generalizations of this concept to operators on Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension.","image":"9a50080b735975d8001c9552ac2134b49ad534c0.svg"}
