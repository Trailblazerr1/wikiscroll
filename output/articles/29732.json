{"title":"Michigan Central Station","summary":"Michigan Central Station (also known as Michigan Central Depot or MCS) is the historic former main intercity passenger rail station in Detroit, Michigan. Built for the Michigan Central Railroad, it replaced the original depot in downtown Detroit, which was shuttered after a major fire on December 26, 1913, forcing the still unfinished station into early service. Formally dedicated on January 4, 1914, the station remained open for business until the cessation of Amtrak service on January 6, 1988. The station building consists of a train depot and an office tower with thirteen stories, two mezzanine levels, and a roof height of 230 feet (70 m).  The Beaux-Arts style architecture was designed by architects who had previously worked together on Grand Central Terminal in New York,[1] and it was the tallest rail station in the world at the time of its construction.[2]","image":"A445%2C_Michigan_Central_Station%2C_Detroit%2C_Michigan%2C_United_States%2C_2016.jpg.webp","url":"Michigan_Central_Station"}
