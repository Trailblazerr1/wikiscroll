{"title":"Red Velvet (group)","summary":"Red Velvet (Korean: 레드벨벳; RR: Redeubelbet) is a South Korean girl group formed and managed by SM Entertainment. They originally debuted on August 1, 2014, with the single \"Happiness\" with the four-member line-up of Irene, Seulgi, Wendy and Joy. A fifth member, Yeri, joined the group in March 2015, following the release of their first mini album, Ice Cream Cake. Musically, the work of Red Velvet reflects their own group name: their predominantly-pop \"red\" side experiments occasionally with electronic, funk and hip hop, while their \"velvet\" side focuses on '90s-influenced R&B with elements of ballad and jazz. Their genre versatility and hooks have garnered critical praise.","image":"Red_Velvet_at_Soribada_Awards_on_August_23%2C_2019.png.webp"}
