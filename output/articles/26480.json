{"title":"List of Indianapolis Colts seasons","summary":"The Indianapolis Colts, formerly the Baltimore Colts, are an American football team playing in the National Football League (NFL). This list documents the season-by-season records of the Colts franchise from 1953 to present, including postseason records and league awards for individual players or head coaches. In 1953, a Baltimore-based group led by Carroll Rosenbloom gained the rights to a new Baltimore franchise. Rosenbloom was granted an NFL team, and was awarded the holdings of the defunct Dallas Texans organization, the descendant of the last remaining Ohio League founding APFA member Dayton Triangles.[1] The new team kept the Triangles' blue and white color scheme and was named the Colts after the unrelated previous team that folded after the 1950 NFL season.[2] After 31 seasons in Baltimore, Colts owner Robert Irsay moved the team to Indianapolis, Indiana.[3]","image":"Bush_Congratulates_2006_Colts.jpg.webp"}
