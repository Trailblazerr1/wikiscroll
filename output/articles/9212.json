{"title":"Champagne wine region","summary":"The Champagne wine region is a wine region within the historical province of Champagne in the northeast of France. The area is best known for the production of  Champagne, the sparkling white wine that bears the region's name. EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term \"Champagne\" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts within the historical province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. The towns of Reims and Épernay are the commercial centers of the area. Reims is famous for its cathedral, the venue of the coronation of the French Kings and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1]","image":"Vignobles_champagne.svg.png.webp","url":"Champagne_wine_region"}
