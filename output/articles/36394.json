{"title":"Pseudomonas","summary":"Pseudomonas is a genus of Gram-negative, Gammaproteobacteria, belonging to the family Pseudomonadaceae and containing 191 validly described species.[1] The members of the genus demonstrate a great deal of metabolic diversity and consequently are able to colonize a wide range of niches.[2] Their ease of culture in vitro and availability of an increasing number of Pseudomonas strain genome sequences has made the genus an excellent focus for scientific research; the best studied species include P. aeruginosa in its role as an opportunistic human pathogen, the plant pathogen P. syringae, the soil bacterium P. putida, and the plant growth-promoting P. fluorescens, P. lini, P. migulae, and P. graminis.[3][4]","image":"Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_01.jpg.webp"}
