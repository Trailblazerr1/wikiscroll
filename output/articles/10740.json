{"title":"Community areas in Chicago","summary":"The city of Chicago is divided into 77 community areas for statistical and planning purposes.  Census data and other statistics are tied to the areas, which serve as the basis for a variety of urban planning initiatives on both the local and regional levels. The areas' boundaries do not generally change, allowing comparisons of statistics across time. The areas are distinct from but related to the more numerous  neighborhoods of Chicago; an area often corresponds to a neighborhood or encompasses several neighborhoods, but the areas do not always correspond to popular conceptions of the neighborhoods due to a number of factors including historical evolution and choices made by the creators of the areas. As of 2020,  Near North Side is the most populous of the areas with over 105,000 residents, while  Burnside is the least populous with just over 2,500. Other geographical divisions of Chicago exist, such as the \"sides\" created by the branches of the Chicago River, the wards of the Chicago City Council, and the parishes of the Roman Catholic Church.","image":"Chicago_Community_Areas.svg.png.webp","url":"Community_areas_in_Chicago"}
