{"title":"Underwater diving","summary":"Underwater diving, as a human activity, is the practice of descending below the water's surface to interact with the environment.\nImmersion in water and exposure to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend the depth and duration of human dives, and allow different types of work to be done.","image":"Diving_stage.jpg.webp"}
