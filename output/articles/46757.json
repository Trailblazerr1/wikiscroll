{"title":"United States congressional delegations from Hawaii","summary":"Since Hawaii became a state in 1959,[1] it has sent congressional delegations to the United States Senate and United States House of Representatives. Each state elects two senators to serve for six years. Members of the House of Representatives are elected to two-year terms, one from each of Hawaii's congressional districts. Before becoming a state, the Territory of Hawaii elected a non-voting delegate at-large to Congress from 1900 to 1958.","image":"lossless-page1-380px-Hawaii_Congressional_Districts%2C_113th_Congress.tif.png.webp"}
