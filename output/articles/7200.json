{"title":"Bonsai","summary":"Bonsai (Japanese: 盆栽, lit. 'tray planting', pronounced [boɰ̃sai] (listen))[1] is a Japanese version of the original traditional Chinese art penjing or penzai. Unlike penjing, which utilizes traditional techniques to produce entire natural sceneries in small pots that mimic the grandiose and shape of real life sceneries, the Japanese \"bonsai\" only attempts to produce small trees that mimic the shape of real life trees. Similar versions of the art exist in other cultures, including the miniature living landscapes of Vietnamese Hòn non bộ. It was during the Tang dynasty, when penjing was at its height, that the art was first introduced into Japan.","image":"Pescia%2C_museo_del_bonsai%2C_punica_granatum%2C_stile_moyogi_(eretto_informale)%2C_con_frutti.jpg.webp","url":"Bonsai"}
