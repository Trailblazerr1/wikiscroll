{"title":"Districts of Germany","summary":"In all German states, except for the three city states, the primary administrative subdivision higher than a Gemeinde (Municipality) is the Landkreis (official term in all but two states) or Kreis (official term in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein).[1] Most major cities in Germany are not part of any Kreis, but instead combine the functions of a municipality and a Kreis; such a city is referred to as a kreisfreie Stadt (literally \"district-free city\"; official term in all but one state) or Stadtkreis (literally \"urban district\"; official term in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg).","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Districts_of_Germany"}
