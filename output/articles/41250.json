{"title":"Solar Orbiter","summary":"The Solar Orbiter (SolO)[8] is a Sun-observing satellite, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA). SolO is intended to perform detailed measurements of the inner heliosphere and nascent solar wind, and perform close observations of the polar regions of the Sun, which is difficult to do from Earth, both serving to answer the question \"How does the Sun create and control the heliosphere?\"","image":"Solar_Orbiter_Transparent.png.webp"}
