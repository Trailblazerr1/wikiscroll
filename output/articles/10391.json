{"title":"Cocaine","summary":"Cocaine (from French: cocaïne, from Spanish: coca, ultimately from Quechua: kúka)[13] is a tropane alkaloid and stimulant drug obtained primarily from the leaves of two coca species native to South America, Erythroxylum coca and Erythroxylum novogranatense.[14] It is most commonly used as a recreational drug and euphoriant.[15] After extraction from coca leaves and further processing into cocaine hydrochloride (powdered cocaine), the drug may be snorted, heated until sublimated and then inhaled, or dissolved and injected into a vein.[12]  Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, sexual arousal, loss of contact with reality, or agitation.[12] Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and dilated pupils.[12] High doses can result in high blood pressure or body temperature.[16] Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes.[12]","image":"Kokain_-_Cocaine.svg.png.webp"}
