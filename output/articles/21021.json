{"title":"Human eye","summary":"The human eye is a sense organ that reacts to light and allows vision. Rod and cone cells in the retina are photoreceptive cells which are able to detect visible light and convey this information to the brain. Eyes signal information which is used by the brain to elicit the perception of colour, shape, depth, movement, and other features. The eye is part of the sensory nervous system.","image":"Human_eye_with_blood_vessels.jpg.webp"}
