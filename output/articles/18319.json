{"title":"Goblet cell","summary":"Goblet cells are simple columnar epithelial cells that secrete gel-forming mucins, like mucin MUC5AC.[1] The goblet cells mainly use the merocrine method of secretion, secreting vesicles into a duct, but may use apocrine methods, budding off their secretions, when under stress.[2] The term goblet refers to the cell's goblet-like shape.  The apical portion is shaped like a cup, as it is distended by abundant mucus laden granules; its basal portion lacks these granules and is shaped like a stem.","image":"404_Goblet_Cell_new.jpg.webp","url":"Goblet_cell"}
