{"title":"The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)","summary":"The Man with the Golden Gun is the twelfth and final novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series and thirteenth Bond book overall. It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the UK on 1 April 1965, eight months after the author's death. The novel was not as detailed or polished as the others in the series, leading to poor but polite reviews. Despite that, the book was a best-seller.","image":"Man_with_the_Golden_Gun-Ian_Fleming.jpg.webp"}
