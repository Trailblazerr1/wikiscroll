{"title":"Diglyceride","summary":"A diglyceride, or  diacylglycerol (DAG), is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages.[1] Two possible forms exist, 1,2-diacylglycerols and 1,3-diacylglycerols. DAGs can act as surfactants and are commonly used as emulsifiers in processed foods. DAG-enriched oil (particularly 1,3-DAG) has been investigated extensively as a fat substitute due to its ability to suppress the accumulation of body fat;[2][3] with total annual sales of approximately USD 200 million in Japan since its introduction in the late 1990s till 2009.[2]","image":"1%2C2-diacylglycerol.svg.png.webp","url":"Diglyceride"}
