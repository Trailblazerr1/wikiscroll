{"title":"Panic of 1907","summary":"The Panic of 1907 – also known as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis[1] – was a financial crisis that took place in the United States over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at bucket shops.[2]","image":"1907_Panic_crop.png.webp","url":"Panic_of_1907"}
