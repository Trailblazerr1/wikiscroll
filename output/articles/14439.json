{"title":"Electrical resistivity and conductivity","summary":"Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume resistivity) is a fundamental property of  a material that measures how strongly it resists electric current. A low resistivity indicates a material that readily allows electric current. Resistivity is commonly represented by the Greek letter ρ (rho). The SI unit of electrical resistivity is the ohm-meter (Ω⋅m).[1][2][3]  For example, if a 1 m3 solid cube of material has sheet contacts on two opposite faces, and the resistance between these contacts is 1 Ω, then the resistivity of the material is 1 Ω⋅m.","image":"9566636088b5bd9de3551f3a03f63e866065f960.svg","url":"Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"}
