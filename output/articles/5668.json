{"title":"Barycenter","summary":"In astronomy, the barycenter (or barycentre; from the Ancient Greek βαρύς heavy  κέντρον center[1]) is the center of mass of two or more bodies that orbit one another and is the point about which the bodies orbit. A barycenter is a dynamical point, not a physical object. It is an important concept in fields such as astronomy and astrophysics. The distance from a body's center of mass to the barycenter can be calculated as a two-body problem.","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp","url":"Barycenter"}
