{"title":"Accommodation (eye)","summary":"Accommodation is the process by which the vertebrate eye changes optical power to maintain a clear image or focus on an object as its distance varies.  In this, distances vary for individuals from the far point—the maximum distance from the eye for which a clear image of an object can be seen, to the near point—the minimum distance for a clear image. Accommodation usually acts like a reflex, including part of the accommodation-vergence reflex, but it can also be consciously controlled. Mammals, birds and reptiles vary their eyes' optical power by changing the form of the elastic lens using the ciliary body (in humans up to 15 dioptres in the mean). Fish and amphibians vary the power by changing the distance between a rigid lens and the retina with muscles.[1]","image":"Duane_(1922)_Fig_4_modified.svg.png.webp","url":"Accommodation_(eye)"}
