{"title":"Aristocracy (class)","summary":"The aristocracy[1] is historically associated with \"hereditary\" or \"ruling\" social class. In many states, the aristocracy included the upper class of people (aristocrats) with hereditary rank and titles.[2] In some, such as ancient Greece, ancient Rome, or India, aristocratic status came from belonging to a military caste. It has also been common, notably in African societies, for aristocrats to belong to priestly dynasties. Aristocratic status can involve feudal or legal privileges.[3] They are usually below only the monarch of a country or nation in its social hierarchy.[4] In modern European societies, the aristocracy has often coincided with the nobility, a specific class that arose in the Middle Ages, but the term \"aristocracy\" is sometimes also applied to other elites, and is used as a more generic term when describing earlier and non-European societies.[5] Some revolutions, such as the French Revolution, have been followed by the abolition of the aristocracy.","image":"Le_bal_par√©.jpg.webp","url":"Aristocracy_(class)"}
