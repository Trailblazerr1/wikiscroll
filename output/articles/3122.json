{"title":"Aluminium oxide","summary":"Aluminium oxide is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula Al2O3. It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides, and specifically identified as aluminium(III) oxide. It is commonly called alumina and may also be called aloxide, aloxite, or alundum depending on particular forms or applications.  It occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase Î±-Al2O3 as the mineral corundum, varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire.  Al2O3 is significant in its use to produce aluminium metal, as an abrasive owing to its hardness, and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point.[7]","image":"Corundum-3D-balls.png.webp"}
