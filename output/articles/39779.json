{"title":"Sea of Galilee","summary":"The Sea of Galilee (Hebrew: יָם כִּנֶּרֶת‎, Judeo-Aramaic: יַמּא דטבריא, גִּנֵּיסַר, Arabic: بحيرة طبريا‎), also called Lake Tiberias, Kinneret or Kinnereth,[3] is a freshwater lake in Israel. It is the lowest freshwater lake on Earth and the second-lowest lake in the world (after the Dead Sea, a saltwater lake),[4] at levels between 215 metres (705 ft) and 209 metres (686 ft) below sea level.[5] It is approximately 53 km (33 mi) in circumference, about 21 km (13 mi) long, and 13 km (8.1 mi) wide. Its area is 166.7 km2 (64.4 sq mi) at its fullest, and its maximum depth is approximately 43 metres (141 ft).[6] The lake is fed partly by underground springs but its main source is the Jordan River, which flows through it from north to south and exits the lake at the Degania Dam.","image":"Kinneret_cropped.jpg.webp","url":"Sea_of_Galilee"}
