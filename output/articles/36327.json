{"title":"Proto-Greek language","summary":"The Proto-Greek language (also known as Proto-Hellenic) is the Indo-European language which was the last common ancestor of all varieties of Greek, including Mycenaean Greek, the subsequent ancient Greek dialects (i.e., Attic, Ionic, Aeolic, Doric, Arcadocypriot, and ancient Macedonianâ€”either a dialect or a closely related Hellenic language) and, ultimately, Koine, Byzantine and Modern Greek (along with its variants). Proto-Greek speakers entered Greece sometime between 2200 and 1900 BCE,[1][2][4] with the diversification into a southern and a northern group beginning by approximately 1700 BCE.[5][9][10][11][12][13]","image":"Indo-European_migrations.gif"}
