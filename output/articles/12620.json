{"title":"Denisovan","summary":"The Denisovans or Denisova hominins ( /dɪˈniːsəvə/ di-NEE-sə-və) are an extinct species or subspecies of archaic human that ranged across Asia during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic. Denisovans are known from few remains, and, consequently, most of what is known about them comes from DNA evidence. No formal species name has been erected pending more complete fossil material.","image":"Denisova_4_Denisovan_molar_3.jpg.webp"}
