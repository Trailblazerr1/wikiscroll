{"title":"Speech balloon","summary":"Speech balloons (also speech bubbles, dialogue balloons, or word balloons) are a graphic convention used most commonly in comic books, comics, and cartoons to allow words (and much less often, pictures) to be understood as representing the speech or thoughts of a given character in the comic. Often, a formal distinction is made between the balloon that indicates thoughts and the one that indicates words spoken aloud; the balloon that conveys thoughts is often referred to as a thought bubble or conversation cloud.","image":"Comic_balloons_4_types_1x4.svg.png.webp"}
