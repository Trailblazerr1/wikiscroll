{"title":"Watchmen (film)","summary":"Watchmen is a 2009 American superhero film based on the 1986–1987 DC Comics limited series of the same name by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film features an ensemble cast including Malin Åkerman, Billy Crudup, Matthew Goode, Carla Gugino, Jackie Earle Haley, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, and Patrick Wilson. A dark and dystopian deconstruction of the superhero genre, the film is set in an alternate history in the year 1985 at the height of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union, as a group of mostly retired American superheroes investigates the murder of one of their own before uncovering an elaborate and deadly conspiracy, while their moral limitations are challenged by the complex nature of the circumstances.","image":"Watchmen_film_poster.jpg.webp","url":"Watchmen_(film)"}
