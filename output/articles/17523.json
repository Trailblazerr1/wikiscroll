{"title":"Gaulish","summary":"Gaulish was an ancient Celtic language that was spoken in parts of Continental Europe before and during the period of the Roman Empire. In the narrow sense, Gaulish was the language spoken by the Celtic inhabitants of Gaul (modern-day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine). In a wider sense, it also comprises varieties of Celtic that were spoken across much of central Europe (\"Noric\"), parts of the Balkans, and Anatolia (\"Galatian\"), which are thought to have been closely related.[1][2] The more divergent Lepontic of Northern Italy has also sometimes been subsumed under Gaulish.[3][4]","image":"Coligny.jpg.webp","url":"Gaulish"}
