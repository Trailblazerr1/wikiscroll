{"title":"Fenghuang","summary":"Fenghuang (traditional Chinese: 鳳凰; simplified Chinese: 凤凰, Mandarin pronunciation: [fə̂ŋ.xwǎŋ]) are mythological birds found in Sinospheric mythology that reign over all other birds. The males were originally called feng and the females huang, but such a distinction of gender is often no longer made and they are blurred into a single feminine entity so that the bird can be paired with the Chinese dragon, which is traditionally deemed male.","image":"Chinese-phoenix-from-nanning.jpg.webp"}
