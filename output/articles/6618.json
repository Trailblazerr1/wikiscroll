{"title":"Binary file","summary":"A binary file is a computer file that is not a text file.[1] The term \"binary file\" is often used as a term meaning \"non-text file\".[2] Many binary file formats contain parts that can be interpreted as text; for example, some computer document files containing formatted text, such as older Microsoft Word document files, contain the text of the document but also contain formatting information in binary form.[2]","image":"Wikipedia_favicon_hexdump.svg.png.webp"}
