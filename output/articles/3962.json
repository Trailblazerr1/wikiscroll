{"title":"Antimicrobial","summary":"An antimicrobial is an agent that kills microorganisms or stops their growth.[1] Antimicrobial medicines can be grouped according to the microorganisms they act primarily against. For example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antifungals are used against fungi. They can also be classified according to their function. Agents that kill microbes are microbicides, while those that merely inhibit their growth are called bacteriostatic agents. The use of antimicrobial medicines to treat infection is known as antimicrobial chemotherapy, while the use of antimicrobial medicines to prevent infection is known as antimicrobial prophylaxis.","image":"Selman_Waksman_NYWTS.jpg.webp","url":"Antimicrobial"}
