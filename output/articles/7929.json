{"title":"Burn","summary":"A burn is a type of injury to  skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn).[6] Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire.[10] While rates are similar for males and females, the underlying causes often differ.[7] Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves.[7] Among men, risk is related to the work environments.[7] Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors.[7] Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault).[7]","image":"Hand2ndburn.jpg.webp","url":"Burn"}
