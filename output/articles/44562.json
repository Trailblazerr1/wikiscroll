{"title":"The Satanic Bible","summary":"The Satanic Bible is a collection of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma.[1] It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary \nSatanism.[2] Though The Satanic Bible is not considered to be sacred scripture in the way that the Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text[1] as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status.[3] It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as \"atheistic Satanists\"[4] because they believe that God and Satan are not external entities, but rather projections of an individual's own personalityâ€”benevolent and stabilizing forces in their life.[5][6] There have been thirty printings of The Satanic Bible,[7] selling over a million copies.[8]","image":"TheSatanicBible.jpg.webp"}
