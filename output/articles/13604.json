{"title":"Drawing (manufacturing)","summary":"Drawing is a metalworking process that uses tensile forces to stretch (elongate) metal, glass, or plastic. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches to become thinner, to achieve a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified into two types: sheet metal drawing and wire, bar, and tube drawing. Sheet metal drawing is defined as plastic deformation over a curved axis. For wire, bar, and tube drawing, the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually performed at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however, drawing may also be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections in order to reduce forces.[1][2]","image":"Bar_drawing.svg.png.webp","url":"Drawing_(manufacturing)"}
