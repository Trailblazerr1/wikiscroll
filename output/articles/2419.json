{"title":"Agnosticism","summary":"Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God, the divine, or the supernatural is not known or knowable with any certainty. If the question is \"Does God exist?\", \"yes\" would imply theism, \"no\" would imply atheism, and \"I'm not sure\" would imply agnosticismâ€”that God possibly can or cannot exist.[1][2][3][4] Another definition provided is the view that \"human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.\"[3]","image":"Irreligion_tree-en.svg.png.webp"}
