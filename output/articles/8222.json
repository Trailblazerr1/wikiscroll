{"title":"Caledonia","summary":"Caledonia (/ˌkælɪˈdoʊniə/, Latin: Calēdonia [käɫ̪eːˈd̪ɔniä]) was the Latin name used by the Roman Empire to refer to the part of Great Britain (Latin: Britannia) that lies north of the River Forth,  which includes most of the land area of Scotland.[1] Today, it is used as a romantic or poetic name for all of Scotland.[2] During the Roman Empire's occupation of Scotland, the area they called Caledonia was physically separated from the rest of the island by the Antonine Wall. The Romans several times invaded and occupied it, but unlike the rest of the island, it remained outside the administration of Roman Britain.","image":"Bunbury_Vol_2_Map_09_Ptolemy_Britain_p_584.jpg.webp"}
