{"title":"Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord","summary":"Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (/ˌtælɪrænd ˈpɛrɪɡɔːr/,[1] French: [ʃaʁl mɔʁis də tal(ɛ)ʁɑ̃ peʁiɡɔʁ, - moʁ-]; 2 February 1754 – 17 May 1838), 1st Prince of Benevento, then Prince of Talleyrand, was a French clergyman and leading diplomat. After studying theology, he became Agent-General of the Clergy in 1780. In 1789, just before the French Revolution, he became  Bishop of Autun.  He worked at the highest levels of successive French governments, most commonly as foreign minister or in some other diplomatic capacity. His career spanned the regimes of Louis XVI, the years of the French Revolution, Napoleon, Louis XVIII, and Louis-Philippe. Those Talleyrand served often distrusted him but, like Napoleon, found him extremely useful. The name \"Talleyrand\" has become a byword for crafty, cynical diplomacy.","image":"Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-Périgord_-_Pierre-Paul_Prud'hon.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_Maurice_de_Talleyrand-Périgord"}
