{"title":"Exosome complex","summary":"The exosome complex (or PM/Scl complex, often just called the exosome) is a multi-protein intracellular complex capable of degrading various types of RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. Exosome complexes are found in both eukaryotic cells and archaea, while in bacteria a simpler complex called the degradosome carries out similar functions.","image":"Exosome_ribbon.png.webp","url":"Exosome_complex"}
