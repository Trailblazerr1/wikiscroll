{"title":"Shrub","summary":"A shrub (often called a bush) is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant. Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground. Shrubs can be deciduous or evergreen. They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6–10 m (20–33 ft) tall.[1][2] Small shrubs, less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall are sometimes termed subshrubs.  Many botanical groups have species that are shrubs, and others that are trees and herbaceous plants.","image":"Cytisus_scoparius2.jpg.webp","url":"Shrub"}
