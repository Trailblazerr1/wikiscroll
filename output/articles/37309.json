{"title":"Rebirth (Buddhism)","summary":"Rebirth in Buddhism refers to the teaching that the actions of a person lead to a new existence after death, in an endless cycle called saṃsāra.[1][2] This cycle is considered to be dukkha, unsatisfactory and painful. The cycle stops only if moksha (liberation) is achieved by insight and the extinguishing of craving.[3][4] Rebirth is one of the foundational doctrines of Buddhism, along with karma, Nirvana and moksha.[1][3][5]","image":"Dharma_Wheel.svg.png.webp","url":"Rebirth_(Buddhism)"}
