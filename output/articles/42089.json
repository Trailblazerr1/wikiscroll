{"title":"Stardust (Willie Nelson album)","summary":"Stardust is the twenty-second studio album by Willie Nelson, released in April 1978. Its ten songs consist entirely of pop standards that Nelson picked from among his favorites. Nelson asked Booker T. Jones, who was his neighbor in Malibu at the time, to arrange a version of \"Moonlight in Vermont\". Impressed with Jones's work, Nelson asked him to produce the entire album. Nelson's decision to record such well-known tracks was controversial among Columbia executives because he had distinguished himself in the outlaw country genre. Recording of the album took only ten days.","image":"Willie_Nelson_Stardust.jpg.webp","url":"Stardust_(Willie_Nelson_album)"}
