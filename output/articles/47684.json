{"title":"Voice over LTE","summary":"Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) is an LTE high speed wireless communication standard for mobile phones and data terminals, including Internet of things (IoT) devices and wearables. VoLTE has up to three times more voice and data capacity than older 3G UMTS and up to six times more than 2G GSM. It uses less bandwidth because VoLTE's packet headers are smaller than those of unoptimized VoIP/LTE.[1] VoLTE calls are usually charged at the same rate as other calls.","image":"VoLTE_iPhone.jpg.webp"}
