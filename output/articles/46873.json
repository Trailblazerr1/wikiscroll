{"title":"Upanishads","summary":"The Upanishads (/ʊˈpənɪˌʃədz/;[1] Sanskrit: उपनिषद् Upaniṣad pronounced [ˈʊpɐnɪʂɐd̪]) are late Vedic Sanskrit texts of Hindu philosophy which supplied the basis of later Hindu philosophy.[2][3][note 1][note 2] They are the most recent part of the Vedas, the oldest scriptures of Hinduism, and deal with meditation, philosophy, consciousness and ontological knowledge; other parts of the Vedas deal with mantras, benedictions, rituals, ceremonies, and sacrifices.[6][7][8] While among the most important literature in the history of Indian religions and culture, the Upanishads document a wide variety of \"rites, incarnations, and esoteric knowledge\"[9] departing from Vedic ritualism and interpreted in various ways in the later commentarial traditions. Of all Vedic literature, the Upanishads alone are widely known, and their diverse ideas, interpreted in various ways, informed the later traditions of Hinduism.[2][10]","image":"Vyasa.jpg.webp","url":"Upanishads"}
