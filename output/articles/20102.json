{"title":"Henry Vane the Younger","summary":"Sir Henry Vane (baptised 26 March 1613 – 14 June 1662) (often referred to as Harry Vane and Henry Vane the Younger to distinguish him from his father, Henry Vane the Elder) was an English politician, statesman, and colonial governor. He was briefly present in North America, serving one term as the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and supported the creation of Roger Williams' Rhode Island Colony and Harvard College. A proponent of religious tolerance, as governor, he defended Anne Hutchinson[2] and her right to teach religious topics in her home which put him in direct conflict with the Puritan leaders in the Massachusetts Colony.[3][4] He returned to England after losing re-election and eventually, Mrs. Hutchinson was banned from the colony.[5]","image":"Henry_Vane_the_Younger_by_Sir_Peter_Lely.jpg.webp"}
