{"title":"Dred Scott v. Sandford","summary":"Dred Scott v. Sandford,[note 1] 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court held that the United States Constitution was not meant to include American citizenship for people of African descent, regardless of whether they were enslaved or free, and so the rights and privileges that the Constitution confers upon American citizens could not apply to them.[2][3] The Supreme Court's decision has been widely denounced, both for how overtly racist the decision was and its crucial role in the near destruction of the United States four years later.[4] Bernard Schwartz said that it \"stands first in any list of the worst Supreme Court decisionsâ€”Chief Justice Hughes called it the Court's greatest self-inflicted wound.\"[5] Junius P. Rodriguez said that it is \"universally condemned as the U.S. Supreme Court's worst decision\".[6] Historian David Thomas Konig said that it was \"unquestionably, our court's worst decision ever.\"[7]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp","url":"Dred_Scott_v._Sandford"}
