{"title":"Connectome","summary":"A connectome (/kəˈnɛktoʊm/) is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain, and may be thought of as its \"wiring diagram\".  An organism's nervous system is made up of neurons which communicate through synapses. A connectome is constructed by tracing the neuron in a nervous system and mapping where neurons are connected through synapses.","image":"White_Matter_Connections_Obtained_with_MRI_Tractography.png.webp"}
