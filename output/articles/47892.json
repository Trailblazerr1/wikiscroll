{"title":"Walter O'Malley","summary":"Walter Francis O'Malley (October 9, 1903 â€“ August 9, 1979) was an American sports executive who owned the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers team in Major League Baseball from 1950 to 1979. In 1958, as owner of the Dodgers, he brought major league baseball to the West Coast, moving the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles despite the Dodgers being the second most profitable team in baseball from 1946 to 1956,  and coordinating the move of the New York Giants to San Francisco at a time when there were no teams west of Kansas City, Missouri.[1][2]  For this, he was long vilified by Brooklyn Dodgers fans.[3] However, Pro-O'Malley parties describe him as a visionary for the same business action,[4] and many authorities cite him as one of the most influential sportsmen of the 20th century.[5] Other observers say that he was not a visionary, but instead a man who was in the right place at the right time, and regard him as the most powerful and influential owner in baseball after moving the team.[6]","image":"O'Malley_Time_magazine_cover_28-April-1958.jpeg.webp"}
