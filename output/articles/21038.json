{"title":"Human papillomavirus infection","summary":"Human papillomavirus infection (HPV infection) is an infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), a DNA virus from the Papillomaviridae family.[5] Many HPV infections cause no symptoms and 90% resolve spontaneously within two years.[1] However, in some cases, an HPV infection persists and results in either warts or precancerous lesions.[2] These lesions, depending on the site affected, increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, tonsils, or throat.[1][2][3] Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV; two strains, HPV16 and HPV18, account for 70% of cases.[1][7] HPV16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers.[3] Between 60% and 90% of the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV.[7] HPV6 and HPV11 are common causes of genital warts and laryngeal papillomatosis.[1]","image":"2r5k.jpg.webp","url":"Human_papillomavirus_infection"}
