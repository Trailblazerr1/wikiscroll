{"title":"Italic type","summary":"In typography, italic type is a cursive font based on a stylised form of calligraphic handwriting.[1][2][3] Owing to the influence from calligraphy, italics normally slant slightly to the right. Italics are a way to emphasise key points in a printed text, to identify many types of creative works, to cite foreign words or phrases, or, when quoting a speaker, a way to show which words they stressed. One manual of English usage described italics as \"the print equivalent of underlining\"; in other words, underscore in a manuscript directs a typesetter to use italic.[4]","image":"Arrighi_italic.png.webp"}
