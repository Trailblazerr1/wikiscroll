{"title":"Cerebral edema","summary":"Cerebral edema is excess accumulation of fluid (edema) in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain.[1] This typically causes impaired nerve function, increased pressure within the skull, and can eventually lead to direct compression of brain tissue and blood vessels.[1] Symptoms vary based on the location and extent of edema and generally include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, drowsiness, visual disturbances, dizziness, and in severe cases, coma and death.[1]","image":"HirnmetastaseMR001.jpg.webp"}
