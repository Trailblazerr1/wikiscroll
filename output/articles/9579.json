{"title":"Chicago (band)","summary":"Chicago is an American rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1967. The group was initially billed as The Big Thing before calling themselves the Chicago Transit Authority in 1968, and then shortening the name in 1969. The self-described \"rock and roll band with horns\" blended elements of classical music, jazz, R&B, and pop music. They produced numerous top-40 hits over two decades, and continue to record and perform live.","image":"Chicagothebandmillbrook_lar.jpg.webp","url":"Chicago_(band)"}
