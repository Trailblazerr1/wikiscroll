{"title":"Stakeholder (corporate)","summary":"In a corporation, a stakeholder is a member of \"groups without whose support the organization would cease to exist\",[1] as defined in the first usage of the word in a 1963 internal memorandum at the Stanford Research Institute. The theory was later developed and championed by R. Edward Freeman in the 1980s. Since then it has gained wide acceptance in business practice and in theorizing relating to strategic management, corporate governance, business purpose and corporate social responsibility (CSR). The definition of corporate responsibilities through a classification of stakeholders to consider has been criticized as creating a false dichotomy between the \"shareholder model\" and the \"stakeholders model\"[2] or a false analogy of the obligations towards shareholders and other interested parties.[3]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
