{"title":"Autophagy","summary":"Autophagy (or autophagocytosis; from the Ancient Greek αὐτόφαγος autóphagos, meaning \"self-devouring\"[1] and κύτος kýtos, meaning \"hollow\"[2]) is the natural, conserved degradation of the cell that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components through a lysosome-dependent regulated mechanism.[3] It allows the orderly degradation and recycling of cellular components.[4][5] Although initially characterized as a primordial degradation pathway induced to protect against starvation, it has become increasingly clear that autophagy also plays a major role in the homeostasis of non-starved cells.[6] Defects in autophagy have been linked to various human diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer, and interest in modulating autophagy as a potential treatment for these diseases has grown rapidly.[6][7]","image":"Autophagy_diagram_PLoS_Biology.jpg.webp"}
