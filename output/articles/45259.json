{"title":"Tinnitus","summary":"Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no corresponding external sound is present.[1] Nearly everyone will experience a faint \"normal tinnitus\" in a completely quiet room but it is only of concern if it is bothersome or interferes with normal hearing or correlated with other problems.[6] While often described as a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, buzzing, hiss, or roaring.[2] The sound may be soft or loud, low or high pitched, and often appears to be coming from one or both ears or from the head itself.[2] In some people, the sound may interfere with concentration and in some cases it is associated with anxiety and depression.[2] Tinnitus is usually associated with a degree of hearing loss and with decreased comprehension of speech in noisy environments.[2] It is common, affecting about 10–15% of people.[5] Most, however, tolerate it well, and it is a significant problem in only 1–2% of all people.[5] The word tinnitus comes from the Latin tinnire which means \"to ring\".[3]","image":"Bells_2.JPG.webp"}
