{"title":"Morphine","summary":"Morphine is a pain medication of the opiate family that is found naturally in a dark brown, resinous form, from the poppy plant (Papaver somniferum). It can be taken orally or injected.[7][9] It acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to induce analgesia and alter perception and emotional response to pain. Physical and psychological dependence and tolerance may develop with repeated administration.[7] It can be taken for both acute pain and chronic pain and is frequently used for pain from myocardial infarction, kidney stones, and during labor.[7] Morphine can be administered by mouth, by injection into a muscle, by injection under the skin, intravenously, injection into the space around the spinal cord, or rectally.[7] Its maximum effect is reached after about 20 minutes when administered intravenously and 60 minutes when administered by mouth, while the duration of its effect is 3–7 hours.[7][8] Long-acting formulations of morphine are available as MS-Contin, Kadian, and other brand names as well as generically.[7]","image":"Morphin_-_Morphine.svg.png.webp","url":"Morphine"}
