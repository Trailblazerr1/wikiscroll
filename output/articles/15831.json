{"title":"Fashion show","summary":"A fashion show (French défilé de mode) is an event put on by a fashion designer to showcase their upcoming line of clothing and/or accessories during Fashion Week.  Fashion shows debut every season, particularly the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons. This is where the latest fashion trends are made. The two most influential fashion weeks are Paris Fashion Week and New York Fashion Week, which are both semiannual events. The Milan, London and Berlin fashion weeks are also of global importance.[1][2] After some Fashion shows most of them are followed with an after-party in which designers can communicate informally with clients, partners, and friends. In order to attend an after-party, you must also have a special invitation. [3]","image":"Western_Canada_Fashion_Week_-_Fall_2014_(15509223685).jpg.webp","url":"Fashion_show"}
