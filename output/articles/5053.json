{"title":"Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity","summary":"In econometrics, the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model is a statistical model for time series data that describes the variance of the current error term or innovation as a function of the actual sizes of the previous time periods' error terms;[1] often the variance is related to the squares of the previous innovations. The ARCH model is appropriate when the error variance in a time series follows an autoregressive (AR) model; if an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model is assumed for the error variance, the model is a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model.[2]","image":"dffae92517def3ef447649cb614e3277cbd52d4f.svg","url":"Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity"}
