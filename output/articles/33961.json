{"title":"Parliament House (Malta)","summary":"The Parliament House (Maltese: Dar il-Parlament) is the meeting place of the Parliament of Malta located in Valletta, Malta. The building was constructed between 2011 and 2015 to designs by Renzo Piano as part of the City Gate Project, which also included building a new City Gate and converting the ruins of the Royal Opera House into an open-air theatre. Construction of the Parliament House generated considerable controversy, mainly due to the modern design of the building and the cost of construction, which amounted to around â‚¬90 million.","image":"Parliament_House_(Malta).jpeg.webp","url":"Parliament_House_(Malta)"}
