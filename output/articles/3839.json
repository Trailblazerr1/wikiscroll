{"title":"Anomalocaris","summary":"Anomalocaris (\"unlike other shrimp\", or \"abnormal shrimp\") is an extinct genus of radiodont (anomalocaridid), an order of animals thought to be closely related to ancestral arthropods. The first fossils of Anomalocaris were discovered in the Ogygopsis Shale by Joseph Frederick Whiteaves, with more examples found by Charles Doolittle Walcott in the Burgess Shale.[3] Originally several fossilized parts discovered separately (the mouth, frontal appendages, and trunk) were thought to be three separate creatures, a misapprehension corrected by Harry B. Whittington and Derek Briggs in a 1985 journal article.[3][4] Anomalocaris is thought to be one of the earliest examples of an apex predator, though others have been found in older Cambrian lagerst√§tten deposits.","image":"ROM-BurgessShale-CompleteAnomalocarisFossil.png.webp"}
