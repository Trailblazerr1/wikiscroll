{"title":"Momentum","summary":"In Newtonian mechanics, linear momentum, translational momentum, or simply momentum is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If m is an object's mass and v is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum p is","image":"21233e5c3bb1a4db8ed4a3ceb873f166a495c7f9.svg","url":"Momentum"}
