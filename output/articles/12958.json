{"title":"Differential equation","summary":"In mathematics, a differential equation is an equation that relates one or more functions and their derivatives.[1] In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, economics, and biology.","image":"Navier_Stokes_Laminar.svg.png.webp","url":"Differential_equation"}
