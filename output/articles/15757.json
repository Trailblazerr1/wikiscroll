{"title":"Family structure in the United States","summary":"The traditional family structure in the United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, heterosexual, nuclear family has become less prevalent, and nontraditional family forms have become more common.[1] The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations.[2] Those generations, the extended family of aunts and uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.","image":"Family_jump.jpg.webp"}
