{"title":"Electromagnetic radiation and health","summary":"Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into two types: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation, based on the capability of a single photon with more than 10Â eV energy to ionize atoms or break chemical bonds.[1] Extreme ultraviolet and higher frequencies, such as X-rays or gamma rays are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see radiation poisoning.","image":"Electromagnetic_Spectrum_1030.png.webp","url":"Electromagnetic_radiation_and_health"}
