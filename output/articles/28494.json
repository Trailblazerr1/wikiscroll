{"title":"Mariah Carey singles discography","summary":"American singer Mariah Carey has released 86 official singles, 22 promotional singles, and has made 30 guest appearances. Her self-titled debut album in 1990 yielded four number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, the first being \"Vision of Love\", a song credited with revolutionizing the usage of distinguished vocal stylings, predominantly the practice of melisma, and effectively influencing virtually every female R&B performer since the 1990s.[1] Subsequent singles \"Emotions\" (1991) and Carey's cover of the Jackson 5 track, \"I'll Be There\" (1992) continued the singer's streak of US number-one singles, with the latter becoming her fourth chart-topper in Canada and first in the Netherlands. With the release of Carey's third studio album, Music Box (1993), the singer's international popularity surged upon release of \"Hero\" and the album's third single, her cover of Harry Nilsson's \"Without You\", which became the singer's first number-one single in several countries across Europe.","image":"MariahRAH270519-56_(49620844358)_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Mariah_Carey_singles_discography"}
