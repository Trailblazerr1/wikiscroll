{"title":"Bloch's theorem","summary":"In condensed matter physics, Bloch's theorem states that solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation in a periodic potential take the form of a plane wave modulated by a periodic function. Mathematically, they are written:[1]","image":"121bd97e0a9d413845549361b9bbf688503898e0.svg","url":"Bloch's_theorem"}
