{"title":"Cruise ship","summary":"Cruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, which are used for transport, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports-of-call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\". On \"cruises to nowhere\" or \"nowhere voyages\", cruise ships make two- to three-night round trips without visiting any ports of call.[1]","image":"M_s_galaxy.jpg.webp"}
