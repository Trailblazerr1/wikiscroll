{"title":"Orphanage","summary":"Historically, an orphanage is a residential institution, or group home, devoted to the care of orphans and other children who were separated from their biological families. Examples of what would cause a child to be placed in orphanages are when the parents were deceased, the biological family was abusive to the child, there was substance abuse or mental illness in the biological home that was detrimental to the child, or the parents had to leave to work elsewhere and were unable or unwilling to take the child. The role of legal responsibility for the support of children whose parent(s) have died or are otherwise unable to provide care differs internationally.","image":"9403_-_Venezia_-_Calle_della_Piet√†_-_Lapide_della_ex_ruota_degli_esposti_-1548-_-_Foto_Giovanni_Dall'Orto_12-Aug-2007.jpg.webp"}
