{"title":"Enriched uranium","summary":"Enriched uranium is a type of uranium in which the percent composition of uranium-235 (written 235U) has been increased through the process of isotope separation. Naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major isotopes:  uranium-238 (238U with 99.2739–99.2752% natural abundance), uranium-235 (235U, 0.7198–0.7202%), and uranium-234 (234U, 0.0050–0.0059%).[1] 235U is the only nuclide existing in nature (in any appreciable amount) that is fissile with thermal neutrons.[2]","image":"Uranium_enrichment_proportions.svg.png.webp"}
