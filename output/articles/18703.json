{"title":"Graph of a function","summary":"In mathematics, the graph of a function \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f}\n  \n is the set of ordered pairs \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        ,\n        y\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x,y)}\n  \n, where \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        =\n        y\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)=y.}\n  \n In the common case where \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n  \n are real numbers, these pairs are Cartesian coordinates of points in two-dimensional space and thus form a subset of this plane.","image":"132e57acb643253e7810ee9702d9581f159a1c61.svg"}
