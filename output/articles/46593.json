{"title":"Unification of Moldova and Romania","summary":"The unification of Moldova and Romania (Romanian: Unirea Republicii Moldova cu Rom√¢nia) is a popular concept in the two countries that began in the late 1980s, during the collapse of communism. The Romanian Revolution in 1989 and the independence of Moldova in 1991 further contributed to the development of a movement for the unification of the two Romanian-speaking countries. The question of reunification is recurrent in the public sphere of the two countries, often as a speculation, both as a goal and a danger. Most of Romania supports unification, but a majority in Moldova continues to oppose it. However, support in Moldova for reunification has increased significantly, with polls asking \"if a referendum took place next Sunday regarding the unification of the Republic of Moldova and Romania, would you vote for or against the unification?\" rising from approximately 20% to over 40% support from 2015 to 2021. Support for unification with Romania is much lower in Transnistria and Gagauzia than in the rest of Moldova.","image":"Movement_for_the_unification_of_Romania_and_Moldova.png.webp"}
