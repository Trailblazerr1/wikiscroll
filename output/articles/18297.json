{"title":"Glycosyltransferase","summary":"Glycosyltransferases (GTFs, Gtfs) are enzymes (EC 2.4) that establish natural glycosidic linkages. They catalyze the transfer of saccharide moieties from an activated nucleotide sugar (also known as the \"glycosyl donor\") to a nucleophilic glycosyl acceptor molecule, the nucleophile of which can be oxygen- carbon-, nitrogen-, or sulfur-based.[1]","image":"Glycosyltransferase_Folds.png.webp","url":"Glycosyltransferase"}
