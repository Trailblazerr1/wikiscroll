{"title":"5-HT2A receptor","summary":"The 5-HT2A receptor is a subtype of the 5-HT2 receptor that belongs to the serotonin receptor family and is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).[4] The 5-HT2A receptor is a cell surface receptor.[5] 5-HT is short for 5-hydroxy-tryptamine, which is serotonin. This is the main excitatory receptor subtype among the GPCRs for serotonin, although 5-HT2A may also have an inhibitory effect[6] on certain areas such as the visual cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex.[7] This receptor was first noted for its importance as a target of serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. Later it came back to prominence because it was also found to be mediating, at least partly, the action of many antipsychotic drugs, especially the atypical ones.","image":"5ht2a.jpg.webp","url":"5-HT2A_receptor"}
