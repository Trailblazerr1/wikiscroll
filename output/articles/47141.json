{"title":"Varanus salvadorii","summary":"Varanus salvadorii, also known as the crocodile monitor, Papua(n) monitor, Salvadori's monitor, and artellia,[5] is a species of monitor lizard endemic to New Guinea. It is the largest monitor lizard known from New Guinea, and is one of the longest lizards in the world, verified at up to 244 cm (8 ft). The tail of the species is exceptionally long, so some specimens have been claimed to exceed the length of the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon; however, V. salvadorii is far less massive.","image":"Amneville_Varanus_salvadorii_27082010_4.jpg.webp"}
