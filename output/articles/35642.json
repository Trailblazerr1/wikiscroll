{"title":"Portuguese language","summary":"Portuguese (português or, in full, língua portuguesa) is a Romance language originating in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. It is the sole official language of Portugal, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Brazil,[6] while having co-official language status in East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, and Macau. A Portuguese-speaking person or nation is referred to as \"Lusophone\" (lusófono). As the result of expansion during colonial times, a cultural presence of Portuguese and Portuguese creole speakers is also found around the world.[7] Portuguese is part of the Ibero-Romance group that evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in the medieval Kingdom of Galicia and the County of Portugal, and has kept some Celtic phonology in its lexicon.[8][9]","image":"Map_of_the_portuguese_language_in_the_world.svg.png.webp"}
