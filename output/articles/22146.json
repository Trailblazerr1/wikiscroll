{"title":"Intermodal container","summary":"An intermodal container, often called a shipping container, is a large standardized shipping container, designed and built for intermodal freight transport, meaning these containers can be used across different modes of transport – from ship to rail to truck – without unloading and reloading their cargo.[1] Intermodal containers are primarily used to store and transport materials and products efficiently and securely in the global containerized intermodal freight transport system, but smaller numbers are in regional use as well. These containers are known under a number of names, such as simply container, cargo or freight container, ISO container, shipping, sea or ocean container, sea van or (CONEX) box, container van, sea can, c can, MILVAN,[2][3] SEAVAN, or RO/RO.[4][nb 1]","image":"Container_01_KMJ.jpg.webp","url":"Intermodal_container"}
