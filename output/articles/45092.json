{"title":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra","summary":"Thus Spoke Zarathustra: A Book for All and None (German: Also sprach Zarathustra: Ein Buch für Alle und Keinen), also translated as Thus Spake Zarathustra, is a work of philosophical fiction written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche between 1883 and 1885. The protagonist is nominally the historical Zarathustra, but, besides a handful of sentences, Nietzsche is not particularly concerned with any resemblance. Much of the book purports to be what Zarathustra said, and it repeats the refrain, \"Thus spoke Zarathustra\".","image":"Also_sprach_Zarathustra._Ein_Buch_für_Alle_und_Keinen._In_drei_Theilen.jpg.webp"}
