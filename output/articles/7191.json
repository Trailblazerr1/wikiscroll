{"title":"Bongo (antelope)","summary":"The bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus) is a herbivorous, mostly nocturnal forest ungulate. Bongos are characterised by a striking reddish-brown coat, black and white markings, white-yellow stripes and long slightly spiralled horns. They are the only tragelaphid in which both sexes have horns. They have a complex social interaction and are found in African dense forest mosaics. Native to Africa, they are the third-largest antelope in the world.[3]","image":"Tragelaphus_eurycerus_-Marwell_Wildlife%2C_Hampshire%2C_England-8a.jpg.webp","url":"Bongo_(antelope)"}
