{"title":"Raspberry Pi","summary":"Raspberry Pi (/paÉª/) is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom.[15] The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools and in developing countries.[16][17][18] The original model became more popular than anticipated,[19] selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring,[20] because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of HDMI and USB devices.","image":"Raspberry_Pi_Logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Raspberry_Pi"}
