{"title":"Waistcoat","summary":"A waistcoat (UK and Commonwealth, /ˈwɛskət/ or /ˈweɪstkoʊt/;  colloquially called a weskit[1]), or vest (US), is a sleeveless upper-body garment. It is usually worn over a dress shirt and necktie and below a coat as a part of most men's formal wear. It is also sported as the third piece in the traditional three-piece male suit.[2] Any given vest can be simple or ornate, or for leisure or luxury.[3] Historically, the vest can be worn either in the place of or underneath a larger coat dependent upon the weather, wearer, and setting.[3]","image":"Waistcoat.jpg.webp"}
