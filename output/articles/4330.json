{"title":"Arenavirus","summary":"An arenavirus is a bisegmented ambisense RNA virus that is a member of the family Arenaviridae.[1]  These viruses infect rodents and occasionally humans.  A class of novel, highly divergent arenaviruses, properly known as reptarenaviruses, have also been discovered which infect snakes to produce inclusion body disease. At least eight arenaviruses are known to cause human disease. The diseases derived from arenaviruses range in severity. Aseptic meningitis, a severe human disease that causes inflammation covering the brain and spinal cord, can arise from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Hemorrhagic fever syndromes, including Lassa fever, are derived from infections such as Guanarito virus, Junin virus, Lassa virus, Lujo virus,[2] Machupo virus, Sabia virus, or Whitewater Arroyo virus.[3] Because of the epidemiological association with rodents, some arenaviruses and bunyaviruses are designated as roboviruses.","image":"Viruses-04-02973-g002.webp.png.webp"}
