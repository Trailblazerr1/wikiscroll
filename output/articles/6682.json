{"title":"Biomolecule","summary":"A biomolecule or biological molecule is a loosely used term for molecules present in organisms that are essential to one or more typically biological processes, such as cell division, morphogenesis, or development.[1] Biomolecules include large macromolecules (or polyanions) such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids, as well as small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites and natural products. A more general name for this class of material is biological materials. Biomolecules are an important element of living organisms, those biomolecules are often endogenous,[2] produced within the organism[3] but organisms usually need exogenous biomolecules, for example certain nutrients, to survive.","image":"Myoglobin.png.webp","url":"Biomolecule"}
