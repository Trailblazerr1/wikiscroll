{"title":"Particulates","summary":"Particulates – also known as atmospheric aerosol particles,  atmospheric particulate matter, particulate matter (PM), or suspended particulate matter (SPM) – are microscopic particles of solid or liquid matter suspended in the air. The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate/air mixture, as opposed to the particulate matter alone.[1] Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic.[2] They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health, in ways additional to direct inhalation.","image":"Airborne-particulate-size-chart.svg.png.webp","url":"Particulates"}
