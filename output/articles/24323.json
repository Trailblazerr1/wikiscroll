{"title":"Kama Sutra","summary":"The Kama Sutra (/ˈkɑːmə ˈsuːtrə/; Sanskrit: कामसूत्र, pronunciation , Kāma-sūtra; lit. 'Principles of Lust') is  an ancient  Indian Hindu[1][2] Sanskrit text on sexuality, eroticism and emotional fulfillment in life.[3][4][5] Attributed to Vātsyāyana,[6] The most ancient book on Kamasutra was composed in Abhira Kingdom.[7] The Kama Sutra is neither exclusively nor predominantly a sex manual on sex positions[3] but written as a guide to the art of living well, the nature of love, finding a life partner, maintaining one's love life, and other aspects pertaining to pleasure-oriented faculties of human life.[3][8][9] It is a sutra-genre text with terse aphoristic verses that have survived into the modern era with different bhāṣyas (exposition and commentaries). The text is a mix of prose and anustubh-meter poetry verses. The text acknowledges the Hindu concept of Purusharthas, and lists desire, sexuality, and emotional fulfillment as one of the proper goals of life. Its chapters discuss methods for courtship, training in the arts to be socially engaging, finding a partner, flirting, maintaining power in a married life, when and how to commit adultery, sexual positions, and other topics.[10] The majority of the book is about the philosophy and theory of love, what triggers desire, what sustains it, and how and when it is good or bad.[11][12]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
