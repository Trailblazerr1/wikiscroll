{"title":"Hurricane Daniel (2006)","summary":"Hurricane Daniel was the second strongest hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. The storm affected Hawaii late in its lifetime, causing moderate rainfall and minor damage. The fourth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the season, Daniel originated on July 16 from a tropical wave off the coast of Mexico. It tracked westward, intensifying steadily to reach peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) on July 22. At the time, the characteristics of the cyclone resembled those of an annular hurricane. Daniel gradually weakened as it entered an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the Central Pacific Ocean, it quickly degenerated into a remnant low on July 26, before dissipating two days later.","image":"Hurricane_daniel_2006.jpg.webp"}
