{"title":"Biography","summary":"A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of their life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.","image":"Plutarchs_Lives_Vol_the_Third_1727.jpg.webp","url":"Biography"}
