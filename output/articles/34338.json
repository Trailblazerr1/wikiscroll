{"title":"Penal Laws","summary":"In the history of Ireland, the Penal Laws (Irish: Na Péindlíthe) was a series of laws imposed in an attempt to force Irish Catholics and Protestant dissenters to accept the established Church of Ireland.[1] These laws notably included the Education Act 1695, the Banishment Act 1697, the Registration Act 1704, the Popery Acts 1704 and 1709, and the Disenfranchising Act 1728. The majority of the penal laws were removed in the period 1778–1793 with the last of them of any significance being removed in 1829. Notwithstanding those previous enactments, the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (coming into force during the Irish War of Independence) contained an all-purpose provision in section 5 removing any that might technically still then be in existence.","image":"Saint_Patrick's_Saltire.svg.png.webp","url":"Penal_Laws"}
