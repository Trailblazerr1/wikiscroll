{"title":"Divine Liturgy","summary":"Divine Liturgy (Greek: Θεία Λειτουργία, translit. Theia Leitourgia; Bulgarian: Божествена литургия, romanized: Bozhestvena liturgiya; Serbian: Божанствена литургија, romanized: Božanstvena liturgija; Georgian: საღმრთო ლიტურგია; Russian: Божественная литургия, romanized: Bozhestvennaya liturgiya; Polish: Boska Liturgia; Turkish: Kutsal Litürji; Czech: Božská liturgie) or Holy Liturgy is the Eucharistic service of the Byzantine Rite, developed from the Antiochene Rite of Christian liturgy which is that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. As such, it is used in the Eastern Orthodox, the Byzantine Catholic Churches, and the Ukrainian Lutheran Church.[1] Although the same term is sometimes applied in English to the Eucharistic service of Armenian Christians, both of the Armenian Apostolic Church[2] and of the Armenian Catholic Church,[3] they use in their own language a term[4] meaning \"holy offering\" or \"holy sacrifice\".[5] Other churches also treat \"Divine Liturgy\" simply as one of many names that can be used, but it is not their normal term.[6][7]","image":"Прва_Литургија_у_завршеном_храму_Св.Саве_у_Биограду%2C_Божић_7.1.2021.jpg.webp","url":"Divine_Liturgy"}
