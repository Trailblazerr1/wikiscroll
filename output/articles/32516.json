{"title":"Nucleic acid","summary":"Nucleic acids are biopolymers, or large biomolecules, essential to all known forms of life. They are composed of nucleotides, which are the monomers made of three components: a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base. The two main classes of nucleic acids are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). If the sugar is ribose, the polymer is RNA; if the sugar is the ribose derivative deoxyribose, the polymer is DNA.","image":"Difference_DNA_RNA-EN.svg.png.webp","url":"Nucleic_acid"}
