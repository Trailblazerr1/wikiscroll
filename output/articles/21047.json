{"title":"Human rights in the United States","summary":"Human rights in the United States comprise a series of rights which are legally protected by the Constitution of the United States (particularly the Bill of Rights),[1][2] state constitutions, treaty and customary international law, legislation enacted by Congress and state legislatures, and state referenda and citizen's initiatives. The Federal Government has, through a ratified constitution, guaranteed unalienable rights to its citizens and (to some degree) non-citizens. These rights have evolved over time through constitutional amendments, legislation, and judicial precedent. Along with the rights themselves, the portion of the population granted these rights has expanded over time.[3] Within the United States, federal courts have jurisdiction over international human rights laws.[4]","image":"Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png.webp","url":"Human_rights_in_the_United_States"}
