{"title":"Gamma ray","summary":"A gamma ray, also known as gamma radiation (symbol γ or \n  \n    \n      \n        γ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n  \n), is a penetrating form of electromagnetic radiation arising from the radioactive decay of atomic nuclei. It consists of the shortest wavelength electromagnetic waves and so imparts the highest photon energy. Paul Villard, a French chemist and physicist, discovered gamma radiation in 1900 while studying radiation emitted by radium. In 1903, Ernest Rutherford named this radiation gamma rays based on their relatively strong penetration of matter; in 1900 he had already named two less penetrating types of decay radiation (discovered by Henri Becquerel) alpha rays and beta rays in ascending order of penetrating power.","image":"a223c880b0ce3da8f64ee33c4f0010beee400b1a.svg"}
