{"title":"Shetland sheep","summary":"The Shetland is a small, wool-producing breed of sheep originating in the Shetland Isles, Scotland but is now also kept in many other parts of the world. It is part of the Northern European short-tailed sheep group, and it is closely related to the extinct Scottish Dunface. Shetlands are classified as a landrace or \"unimproved\" breed.[1] This breed is kept for its very fine wool, for meat, and for conservation grazing.[2]","image":"Shetland_sheep_moorit.jpg.webp"}
