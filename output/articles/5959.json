{"title":"Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands","summary":"The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, fought during 25–27 October 1942, sometimes referred to as the Battle of Santa Cruz or Third Battle of Solomon Sea, in Japan as the Battle of the South Pacific (Japanese: 南太平洋海戦 Minamitaiheiyō kaisen), was the fourth aircraft carrier battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II. It was also the fourth major naval engagement fought between the United States Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy during the lengthy and strategically important Guadalcanal campaign. As in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, and the Eastern Solomons, the ships of the two adversaries were rarely in sight or gun range of each other. Instead, almost all attacks by both sides were mounted by carrier- or land-based aircraft.","image":"USS_Enterprise_(CV-6)_under_attack_by_dive_bombers_during_the_Battle_of_Santa_Cruz_Islands_on_26_October_1942_(80-G-20989).jpg.webp","url":"Battle_of_the_Santa_Cruz_Islands"}
