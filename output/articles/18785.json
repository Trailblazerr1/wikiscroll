{"title":"Great Fire of London","summary":"The Great Fire of London  was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of London from Sunday, 2 September to Thursday, 6 September 1666.[1] The fire gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city wall. It threatened, but did not reach, the City of Westminster (today's West End), Charles II's Palace of Whitehall, and most of the suburban slums.[2] It destroyed 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, St Paul's Cathedral, and most of the buildings of the City authorities. It is estimated to have destroyed the homes of 70,000 of the City's 80,000 inhabitants.[3]","image":"Great_Fire_London.jpg.webp","url":"Great_Fire_of_London"}
