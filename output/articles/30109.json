{"title":"Misdemeanor","summary":"A misdemeanor (American English,[1] spelled misdemeanour elsewhere) is any \"lesser\" criminal act in some common law legal systems. Misdemeanors are generally punished less severely than felonies,[2][3] but theoretically more so than administrative infractions (also known as minor, petty, or summary offences) and regulatory offences. Misdemeanor convictions typically result in small monetary fines, community service, or less than a year of jail-time.","image":"Graffiti_in_Bucharest%2C_July_2007.jpg.webp","url":"Misdemeanor"}
