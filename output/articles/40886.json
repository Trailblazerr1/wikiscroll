{"title":"Skeletal muscle","summary":"Skeletal muscles (commonly referred to as muscles) are organs of the vertebrate muscular system that are mostly attached by tendons to bones of the skeleton.[1][2] The muscle cells of skeletal muscles are much longer than in the other types of muscle tissue, and are often known as muscle fibers.[3] The muscle tissue of a skeletal muscle is striated â€“ having a striped appearance due to the arrangement of the sarcomeres.","image":"Skeletal_muscle.jpg.webp"}
