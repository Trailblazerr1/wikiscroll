{"title":"Zaolzie","summary":"Zaolzie [zaˈɔlʑɛ] (listen) is the Polish name for an area now in the Czech Republic which was disputed between interwar Poland and Czechoslovakia. The name means \"lands beyond the Olza River\"; it is also called Śląsk zaolziański, meaning \"trans-Olza Silesia\". Equivalent terms in other languages include Zaolší (Zaolží) in Czech and Olsa-Gebiet in German.  The Zaolzie region was created in 1920, when Cieszyn Silesia was divided between Czechoslovakia and Poland. Zaolzie forms the eastern part of the Czech portion of Cieszyn Silesia. The division did not satisfy any side, and persisting conflict over the region led to its annexation by Poland in October 1938, following the Munich Agreement. After the invasion of Poland in 1939, the area became a part of Nazi Germany until 1945. After the war, the 1920 borders were restored.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
