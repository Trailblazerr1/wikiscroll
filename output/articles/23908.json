{"title":"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell","summary":"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is the debut novel by British writer Susanna Clarke. Published in 2004, it is an alternative history set in 19th-century England around the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Its premise is that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Centred on the relationship between these two men, the novel investigates the nature of \"Englishness\" and the boundaries between reason and unreason, Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Dane, and Northern and Southern English cultural tropes/stereotypes. It has been described as a fantasy novel, an alternative history, and a historical novel. It inverts the Industrial Revolution conception of the Northâ€“South divide in England: in this book the North is romantic and magical, rather than rational and concrete.","image":"Jonathan_strange_and_mr_norrell_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Jonathan_Strange_&_Mr_Norrell"}
