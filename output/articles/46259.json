{"title":"Two-round system","summary":"The two-round system, also known as the second ballot, runoff voting, or ballotage, is a voting method used to elect a single candidate, where voters cast a single vote for their preferred candidate. The election proceeds to a second round only if in the first round no candidate has received a simple majority (more than 50%) of votes cast, or at least some other prescribed percentage.[1] In the second round, usually only the two candidates who received the most votes in the first round, or those candidates who received above a prescribed proportion of the votes, would be candidates in the second round. Any remaining candidate is free to withdraw from the second round.","image":"TRS_ballot_papers.svg.png.webp"}
