{"title":"Economic development in India","summary":"The economic development in India followed socialist-inspired politicians for most of its independent history, including state-ownership of many sectors;[1] India's per capita income increased at only around 1% annualised rate in the three decades after its independence.[2] Since the mid-1980s, India has slowly opened up its markets through economic liberalisation. After more fundamental reforms since 1991 and their renewal in the 2000s, India has progressed towards a free market economy.[2]","image":"Composition_of_indias_agricultural_output_in_2003-04.png.webp"}
