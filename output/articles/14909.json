{"title":"Entomology","summary":"Entomology (from Ancient Greek  ἔντομον (entomon) 'insect', and  -λογία (-logia) 'study of'[1]) is the scientific study of insects, a branch of zoology. In the past the term \"insect\" was less specific, and historically the definition of entomology would also include the study of animals in other arthropod groups, such as arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. This wider meaning may still be encountered in informal use.","image":"LeafInsect.jpg.webp"}
