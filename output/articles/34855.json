{"title":"Phosphine","summary":"Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is a colourless, flammable, very toxic gas compound with the chemical formula PH3, classed as a pnictogen hydride. Pure phosphine is odourless, but technical grade samples have a highly unpleasant odour like rotting fish, due to the presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphane (P2H4). With traces of P2H4 present, PH3 is spontaneously flammable in air (pyrophoric), burning with a luminous flame. Phosphine is a highly toxic respiratory poison, and is immediately dangerous to life or health at 50 ppm. Phosphine has a trigonal pyramidal structure.","image":"Monophosphan.svg.png.webp"}
