{"title":"Utopia","summary":"A utopia (/juːˈtoʊpiə/ yoo-TOH-pee-ə) typically describes an imaginary community or society that possesses highly desirable or nearly perfect qualities for its members.[1] It was coined by Sir Thomas More for his 1516 book Utopia, describing a fictional island society in the New World. However, it may also denote an intentional community. In common parlance, the word or its adjectival form may be used synonymously with \"impossible\", \"far-fetched\" or \"deluded\".","image":"Skulptur_Searching_for_Utopia_von_Jan_Fabre_in_Nieuwpoort_(Belgien)_2020-09-6.jpg.webp","url":"Utopia"}
