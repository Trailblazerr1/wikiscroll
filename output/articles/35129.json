{"title":"Plagioclase","summary":"Plagioclase is a series of tectosilicate (framework silicate) minerals within the feldspar group. Rather than referring to a particular mineral with a specific chemical composition, plagioclase is a continuous solid solution series, more properly known as the plagioclase feldspar series.  This was first shown by the German mineralogist Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel (1796â€“1872) in 1826.  The series ranges from albite to anorthite endmembers (with respective compositions NaAlSi3O8 to CaAl2Si2O8), where sodium and calcium atoms can substitute for each other in the mineral's crystal lattice structure. Plagioclase in hand samples is often identified by its polysynthetic crystal twinning or 'record-groove' effect.","image":"Plagioklas1.jpg.webp","url":"Plagioclase"}
