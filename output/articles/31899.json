{"title":"New York World Building","summary":"The New York World Building (also the Pulitzer Building) was a building in the Civic Center of Manhattan in New York City, across from City Hall along Park Row between Frankfort Street and the Brooklyn Bridge. Part of the former \"Newspaper Row\", it was designed by George B. Post in the Renaissance Revival style, and served as the headquarters of the New York World after its completion in 1890. The New York World Building was the tallest building in New York City upon completion, becoming the first to overtop Trinity Church, and was by some accounts the world's tallest building.","image":"New_York_World_Building_New_York_City.jpg.webp"}
