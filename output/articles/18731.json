{"title":"Gravitational lens","summary":"A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter (such as a cluster of galaxies) between a distant light source and an observer, that is capable of bending the light from the source as the light travels toward the observer. This effect is known as gravitational lensing, and the amount of bending is one of the predictions of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity.[1][2]  (Classical physics also predicts the bending of light, but only half of that predicted by general relativity.)[3]","image":"A_Horseshoe_Einstein_Ring_from_Hubble.JPG.webp"}
