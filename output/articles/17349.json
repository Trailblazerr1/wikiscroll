{"title":"Gallia Narbonensis","summary":"Gallia Narbonensis (Latin for \"Gaul of Narbonne\", from its chief settlement)[n 1] was a Roman province located in what is now Languedoc and Provence, in southern France. It was also known as Provincia Nostra (\"Our Province\"), from its having been the first Roman province north of the Alps, and as Gallia Transalpina (\"Transalpine Gaul\"), distinguishing it from Cisalpine Gaul in northern Italy. It became a Roman province in the late 2nd century BC. Gallia Narbonensis was bordered by the Pyrenees Mountains on the west, the Cévennes to the north, the Alps on the east, and the Gulf of Lion on the south; the province included the majority of the Rhone catchment. The western region of Gallia Narbonensis was known as Septimania. The province was a valuable part of the Roman Empire, owing to the Greek colony of Massalia, its location between the Spanish provinces of Rome, and its financial output.[2]","image":"Roman_Empire_Gallia_Narbonensis.svg.png.webp"}
