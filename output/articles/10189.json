{"title":"Classical Kuiper belt object","summary":"A classical Kuiper belt object, also called a cubewano (/ˌkjuːbiːˈwʌnoʊ/ \"QB1-o\"),[lower-alpha 1] is a low-eccentricity Kuiper belt object (KBO) that orbits beyond Neptune and is not controlled by an orbital resonance with Neptune. Cubewanos have orbits with semi-major axes in the 40–50 AU range and, unlike Pluto, do not cross Neptune's orbit. That is, they have low-eccentricity and sometimes low-inclination orbits like the classical planets.","image":"UltimaThule_CA06_color_20190516.png.webp","url":"Classical_Kuiper_belt_object"}
