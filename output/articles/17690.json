{"title":"Genome","summary":"In the fields of molecular biology and genetics, a genome is all genetic information of an organism.[1] It consists of nucleotide sequences of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes (the coding regions) and the noncoding DNA,[2] as well as mitochondrial DNA[3] and chloroplast DNA. The study of the genome is called genomics. The genome for several organisms have been sequenced and genes analyzed, the human genome project which sequenced the entire genome for Homo sapiens was successfully completed in April 2003.","image":"Prokaryotic_Cell_Diagram.jpg.webp","url":"Genome"}
