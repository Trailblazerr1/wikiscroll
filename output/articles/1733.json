{"title":"APL (programming language)","summary":"APL (named after the book A Programming Language)[3] is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols[4] to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming,[5] and computer math packages.[6] It has also inspired several other programming languages.[7][8]","image":"APL_Greek_characters.jpg.webp","url":"APL_(programming_language)"}
