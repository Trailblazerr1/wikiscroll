{"title":"Göbekli Tepe","summary":"Göbekli Tepe (Turkish: [gœbecˈli teˈpe],[2] \"Potbelly Hill\";[3] known as Girê Mirazan or Xirabreşkê in Kurdish[4]) is a Neolithic archaeological site near the city of Şanlıurfa in Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey. Dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, between c. 9500 and 8000 BCE, the site comprises a number of large circular structures supported by massive stone pillars – the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of these pillars are richly decorated with abstract anthropomorphic details, clothing, and reliefs of wild animals, providing archaeologists rare insights into prehistoric religion and the particular iconography of the period. The 15 m (50 ft)-high, 8 ha (20 acres) tell also includes many smaller rectangular buildings, quarries, and stone-cut cisterns from the Neolithic, as well as some traces of activity from later periods.","image":"Göbekli_Tepe%2C_Urfa.jpg.webp","url":"Göbekli_Tepe"}
