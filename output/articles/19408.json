{"title":"Haitian Vodou","summary":"Haitian Vodou[lower-alpha 1] is an African diasporic religion that developed in Haiti between the 16th and 19th centuries. It arose through a process of syncretism between several traditional religions of West and Central Africa and the Roman Catholic form of Christianity. There is no central authority in control of the religion and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Vodouists, Vodouisants, or Serviteurs.","image":"VoodooValris.jpg.webp"}
