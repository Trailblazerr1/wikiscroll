{"title":"Nuclear force","summary":"The nuclear force (or nucleon–nucleon interaction, residual strong force, or, historically, strong nuclear force) is a force that acts between the protons and neutrons of atoms. Neutrons and protons, both nucleons, are affected by the nuclear force almost identically. Since protons have charge +1 e, they experience an electric force that tends to push them apart, but at short range the attractive nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force.  The nuclear force binds nucleons into atomic nuclei.","image":"NuclearReaction.svg.png.webp","url":"Nuclear_force"}
