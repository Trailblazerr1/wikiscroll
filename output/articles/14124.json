{"title":"Economy of China","summary":"The economy of the People's Republic of China is a developing market-oriented mixed economy that incorporates economic planning through industrial policies and strategic five-year plans. Dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and mixed-ownership enterprises, the economy also consists of a large domestic private sector and openness to foreign businesses in a system described as a socialist market economy.[26][27][28]  State-owned enterprises accounted for over 60% of China's market capitalization in 2019[29] and generated 40% of China's GDP of US$15.66 trillion in 2020, with domestic and foreign private businesses and investment accounting for the remaining 60%.[30][31] As of the end of 2019, the total assets of all China's SOEs, including those operating in the financial sector, reached US$78.08 trillion.[32] Ninety-one (91) of these SOEs belong to the 2020 Fortune Global 500 companies.[33] China has the world's second largest economy when measured by nominal GDP, and the world's largest economy since 2014[34] when measured by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which according to some economists is a more accurate measure of an economy's true size.[35][36][37][38][39][40] It has been the second largest by nominal GDP since 2010, with data relying on fluctuating market exchange rates.[41] An official forecast states that China will become the world's largest economy in nominal GDP by 2028.[42]  Historically, China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.[43]","image":"Shanghai_skyline_unsplash.jpg.webp"}
