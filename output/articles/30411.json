{"title":"Monotreme","summary":"Monotremes /ˈmɒnətriːmz/ are prototherian mammals of the order Monotremata. They are one of the three main groups of living mammals, along with placentals (Eutheria) and marsupials (Metatheria). Monotremes are typified by structural differences in their brains, jaws, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and other body parts compared to the more common mammalian types. In addition, they lay eggs rather than bearing live young, but, like all mammals, the female monotremes nurse their young with milk.","image":"Monotreme_collage.jpg.webp","url":"Monotreme"}
