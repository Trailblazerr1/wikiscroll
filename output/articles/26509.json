{"title":"List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders","summary":"In baseball, the strikeout is a statistic used to evaluate pitchers. A pitcher earns a strikeout when he puts out the batter he is facing by throwing a ball through the strike zone, \"defined as that area over homeplate (sic) the upper limit of which is a horizontal line at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants, and the lower level is a line at the hollow beneath the kneecap\",[2] which is not put in play. Strikeouts are awarded in four situations: if the batter is put out on a third strike caught by the catcher (to \"strike out swinging\" or \"strike out looking\"); if the pitcher throws a third strike which is not caught with fewer than two outs; if the batter becomes a baserunner on an uncaught third strike; or if the batter bunts the ball into foul territory with two strikes.[3]","image":"Walter_Johnson_1924.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_Major_League_Baseball_annual_strikeout_leaders"}
