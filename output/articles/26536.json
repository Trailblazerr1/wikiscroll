The series focuses on titular hero and protagonist named Naruto Uzumaki, a ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village with supernatural ninjutsu abilities, who is the host of Nine Tailed Fox, who dreams to become Hokage in order to receive respect from the villagers and to protect them from any upcoming threats.
