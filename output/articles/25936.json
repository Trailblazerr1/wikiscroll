{"title":"Leptin","summary":"Leptin (from Greek λεπτός leptos, \"thin\") is a hormone predominantly made by adipose cells and enterocytes in the small intestine that helps to regulate energy balance by inhibiting hunger, which in turn diminishes fat storage in adipocytes. Leptin acts on cell receptors in the arcuate and ventromedial nuclei, as well as other parts of the hypothalamus and dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area, consequently mediating feeding.[6][7]","image":"Leptin.png.webp","url":"Leptin"}
