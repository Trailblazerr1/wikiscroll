{"title":"Lichen","summary":"A lichen (/ˈlaɪkən/ LY-kən, also UK: /ˈlɪtʃən/ LICH-ən) is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species[1] in a mutualistic relationship.[2][3][4] Lichens have properties different from those of their component organisms. They come in many colors, sizes, and forms and are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. They may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose); flat leaf-like structures (foliose); crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint (crustose);[5] a powder-like appearance (leprose); or other growth forms.[6]","image":"Lichen-covered_tree%2C_Tresco.jpg.webp"}
