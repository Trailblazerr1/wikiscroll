{"title":"Brown v. Board of Education","summary":"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),[1] was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that U.S. state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools are otherwise equal in quality. The Court's decision partially overruled its 1896 decision Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that the \"separate but equal\" notion was unconstitutional for American public schools and educational facilities.[note 1] It paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement,[3] and a model for many future impact litigation cases.[4]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.svg.png.webp"}
