{"title":"Nader Shah","summary":"Nader Shah Afshar (Persian: نادر شاه افشار‎; also known as Nader Qoli Beyg نادر قلی بیگ or Tahmāsp Qoli Khan تهماسب قلی خان) (August 1688[6] – 19 June 1747) was the founder of the Afsharid dynasty of Iran and one of the most powerful Iranian[14] rulers in Iranian history, ruling as Shah of Iran (Persia) from 1736 to 1747, when he was assassinated during a rebellion. Because of his military genius,[15] as evidenced in his numerous campaigns throughout the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central and South Asia, such as the battles of Herat, Mihmandust, Murche-Khort, Kirkuk, Yeghevard, Khyber Pass, Karnal and Kars, some historians have described him as the Napoleon of Persia, the Sword of Persia,[16] or the Second Alexander. Nader belonged to the Turkoman[17] Afshar tribe, a semi-nomadic tribe settled in Khorasan in northeastern Iran,[18] which had supplied military power to the Safavid dynasty since the time of Shah Ismail I.[19]","image":"Nader_Shah_Afshar_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"Nader_Shah"}
