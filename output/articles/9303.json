{"title":"Charles Darwin","summary":"Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS (/ˈdɑːrwɪn/;[5] 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist,[6] best known for his contributions to the science of evolution.[I] His proposition that all species of life have descended from common ancestors is now widely accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science.[7] In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.[8] Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history,[9] and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey.[10]","image":"Charles_Darwin_seated_crop.jpg.webp","url":"Charles_Darwin"}
