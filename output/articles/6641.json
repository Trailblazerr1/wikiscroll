{"title":"Binturong","summary":"The binturong (Arctictis binturong) (/bɪnˈtjʊərɒŋ, ˈbɪntjʊrɒŋ/, bin-TURE-ong, BIN-ture-ong), also known as bearcat, is a viverrid native to South and Southeast Asia. It is uncommon in much of its range, and has been assessed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a declining population trend that is estimated at more than 30% since the mid 1980s.[1] The binturong is the only living species in the genus Arctictis.","image":"Binturong_in_Overloon.jpg.webp","url":"Binturong"}
