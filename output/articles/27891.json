{"title":"Macrinus","summary":"Marcus Opellius Macrinus (/məˈkraɪnəs/; c. 165 – June 218) was Roman emperor from April 217 to June 218, reigning jointly with his young son Diadumenianus. As a member of the equestrian class, he became the first emperor who did not hail from the senatorial class and also the first emperor who never visited Rome during his reign. Before becoming emperor, Macrinus served under Emperor Caracalla as a praetorian prefect and dealt with Rome's civil affairs. He later conspired against Caracalla and had him murdered in a bid to protect his own life, succeeding him as emperor.","image":"Bust_of_Macrinus_-_Palazzo_Nuovo_-_Musei_Capitolini_-_Rome_2016.jpg.webp"}
