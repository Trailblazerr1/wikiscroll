{"title":"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog","summary":"\"On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog\" is an adage and Internet meme about Internet anonymity which began as a caption to a cartoon drawn by Peter Steiner and published by The New Yorker on July 5, 1993.[1][2] The words are those of a large dog sitting on a chair at a desk, with his paw on the keyboard of the computer before him, speaking to a smaller dog sitting on the floor beside him.[3] Steiner had earned between $200,000 and $250,000 by 2013 from its reprinting, by which time it had become the cartoon most reproduced from The New Yorker.[1][4][5][6]","image":"Internet_dog.jpg.webp","url":"On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you're_a_dog"}
