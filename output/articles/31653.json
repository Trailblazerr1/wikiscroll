{"title":"Neocolonialism","summary":"Neocolonialism is the practice of using economic imperialism, globalisation, cultural imperialism and conditional aid to influence a developing country instead of the previous colonial methods of direct military control or indirect political control (hegemony).\nNeocolonialism differs from standard globalisation and development aid in that it typically results in a relationship of dependence, subservience, or financial obligation towards the neocolonialist nation. This may result in an undue degree of political control [1] or spiraling debt obligations,[2] functionally imitating the relationship of traditional colonialism. Neocolonialism frequently affects all levels of society, creating neo-colonial systems that disadvantage local communities, such as neo-colonial science.","image":"Wallerstein's_Core-periphery_model.png.webp"}
