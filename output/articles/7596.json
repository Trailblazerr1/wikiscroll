{"title":"Brine shrimp","summary":"Artemia is a genus of aquatic crustaceans also known as brine shrimp. Artemia, the only genus in the family Artemiidae. The first historical record of the existence of Artemia dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from Urmia Lake, Iran, with an example called by an Iranian geographer an \"aquatic dog\",[2] although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schl√∂sser in 1757 of animals from Lymington, England.[3] Artemia populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes, but not in oceans. Artemia are able to avoid cohabiting with most types of predators, such as fish, by their ability to live in waters of very high salinity (up to 25%).[4]","image":"Artemia_salina_4.jpg.webp","url":"Brine_shrimp"}
