{"title":"Contact mechanics","summary":"Contact mechanics is the study of the deformation of solids that touch each other at one or more points.[1][2] A central distinction in contact mechanics is between stresses acting perpendicular to the contacting bodies' surfaces (known as the normal direction) and frictional stresses acting tangentially between the surfaces. This page focuses mainly on the normal direction, i.e. on frictionless contact mechanics. Frictional contact mechanics is discussed separately.  Normal stresses are caused by applied forces and by the adhesion present on surfaces in close contact even if they are clean and dry.","image":"1856f88def2056f28ed27c7d31180a6240820ea6.svg","url":"Contact_mechanics"}
