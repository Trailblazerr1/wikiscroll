{"title":"Mass spectrometry","summary":"Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of  ions. The results are presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.","image":"Early_Mass_Spectrometer_(replica).jpg.webp","url":"A%2fMass_spectrometry"}
