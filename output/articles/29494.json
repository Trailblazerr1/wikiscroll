{"title":"Metal–organic framework","summary":"Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of compounds consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to organic ligands to form one-, two-, or three-dimensional structures.  They are a subclass of coordination polymers, with the special feature that they are often porous. The organic ligands included are sometimes referred to as \"struts\" or \"linkers\", one example being 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC).","image":"CSIRO_ScienceImage_11637_Scanning_electron_microscope_image_of_the_seed_inside_the_MOF_crystals.jpg.webp","url":"Metal–organic_framework"}
