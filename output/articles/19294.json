{"title":"HMS Bellerophon (1786)","summary":"HMS Bellerophon, known to sailors as the \"Billy Ruffian\", was a ship of the line of the Royal Navy. A third-rate of 74 guns, she was launched in 1786. Bellerophon served during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, mostly on blockades or convoy escort duties. She fought in three fleet actions: the Glorious First of June (1794), the Battle of the Nile (1798) and the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). While the ship was on blockade duty in 1815, Napoleon boarded Bellerophon so he could surrender to the ship's captain, ending 22 years of almost continuous war between Britain and France.","image":"HMS_Bellerophon_and_Napoleon-cropped.jpg.webp","url":"HMS_Bellerophon_(1786)"}
