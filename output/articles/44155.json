{"title":"The Force","summary":"The Force is a metaphysical and ubiquitous power in the Star Wars fictional universe. It is manipulated by \"Force-sensitive\" characters throughout the franchise: heroes like the Jedi who seek to become one with the Force, while the Sith and other villains exploit the Force and try to bend it toward their will. The Force has been compared to aspects of several world religions, and the phrase \"May the Force be with you\" has become part of the popular-culture vernacular.","image":"George_Lucas_cropped_2009.jpg.webp","url":"The_Force"}
