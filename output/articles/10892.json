{"title":"Confidence interval","summary":"In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a range of estimates, defined by a lower bound and upper bound, for an unknown parameter. The interval is computed at a designated confidence level. A 95% confidence level is most common, but other levels, such as 90% or 99%, are sometimes used.[1] The confidence level represents the long-run frequency of confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. In other words, 95% of confidence intervals computed at the 95% confidence level contain the parameter, and likewise for other confidence levels.[2]","image":"e2b92b34537b69ec0cd51faeca399aa775564617.svg","url":"Confidence_interval"}
