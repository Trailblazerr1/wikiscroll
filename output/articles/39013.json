{"title":"Saint","summary":"In religious belief, a saint is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness, likeness, or closeness to God. However, the use of the term saint depends on the context and denomination. In Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, Oriental Orthodox, and Lutheran doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation.[1] Official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently a public cult of veneration, is conferred on some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.[2]","image":"Saint_Joseph's_Catholic_Church_(Central_City%2C_Kentucky)_-_stained_glass%2C_St._Theresa_of_√Åvila_detail.jpg.webp"}
