{"title":"Chi-squared test","summary":"A chi-squared test (also chi-square or Ï‡2 test) is a statistical hypothesis test that is valid to perform when the test statistic is chi-squared distributed under the null hypothesis, specifically Pearson's chi-squared test and variants thereof. Pearson's chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected frequencies and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table.","image":"Chi-square_distributionCDF-English.png.webp"}
