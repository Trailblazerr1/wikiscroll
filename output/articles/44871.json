{"title":"Thermistor","summary":"A thermistor is a type of resistor whose resistance is strongly dependent on temperature, more so than in standard resistors. The word is a combination of thermal and resistor. Thermistors are widely used as inrush current limiters, temperature sensors (negative temperature coefficient or NTC type typically), self-resetting overcurrent protectors, and self-regulating heating elements (positive temperature coefficient or PTC type typically). An operational temperature range of a thermistor is dependent on the probe type and is typically in between −100 °C (−148 °F)  and 300 °C (572 °F).","image":"NTC_bead.jpg.webp","url":"Thermistor"}
