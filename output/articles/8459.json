{"title":"Cap Anson","summary":"Adrian Constantine Anson (April 17, 1852 – April 14, 1922), nicknamed \"Cap\" (for \"Captain\") and \"Pop\", was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) first baseman. Including his time in the National Association (NA), he played a record 27 consecutive seasons.[1] Anson was regarded as one of the greatest players of his era and one of the first superstars of the game.[2] He spent most of his career with the Chicago Cubs franchise (then known as the \"White Stockings\" and later the \"Colts\"), serving as the club's manager, first baseman and, later in his tenure, minority owner. He led the team to six National League pennants in the 1880s. Anson was one of baseball's first great hitters, and probably the first to tally over 3,000 career hits.","image":"Cap_anson_studio_photo.jpg.webp"}
