{"title":"Decision support system","summary":"A decision support system (DSS) is an information system that supports business or organizational decision-making activities. DSSs serve the management, operations and planning levels of an organization (usually mid and higher management) and help people make decisions about problems that may be rapidly changing and not easily specified in advanceâ€”i.e. unstructured and semi-structured decision problems. Decision support systems can be either fully computerized or human-powered, or a combination of both.","image":"Decision_Support_System_for_John_Day_Reservoir.jpg.webp"}
