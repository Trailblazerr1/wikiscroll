{"title":"Bahia","summary":"Bahia (/bəˈhiːə/ bə-HEE-ə, Portuguese: [baˈijɐ, bɐˈijɐ];[lower-alpha 1] meaning \"bay\") is one of the 26 states of Brazil and in the northeast of the country, on the Atlantic coast. It is the fourth-largest Brazilian state by population (after São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro) and the 5th-largest by area. Bahia's capital is the city of Salvador (formerly known as \"Cidade do São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos\", literally \"City of the Saint Savior of the Bay of All the Saints\"), on a spit of land separating the Bay of All Saints from the Atlantic. Once a monarchial stronghold dominated by agricultural, slaving, and ranching interests, Bahia is now still predominantly a working-class industrial and agricultural state. The state is home to 7% of the Brazilian population[4] and produces 4.2% of the country's GDP.[5][6][7][8][9]","image":"Bandeira_da_Bahia.svg.png.webp"}
