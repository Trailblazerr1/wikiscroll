{"title":"Criticism of Facebook","summary":"The criticism of Facebook has led to international media coverage and significant reporting of its legal troubles and the outsize influence it has on the lives and health of its users and employees, as well on its influence on the way media, specifically news, is reported and distributed. Notable issues include Internet privacy, such as use of a widespread \"like\" button on third-party websites tracking users,[1][2] possible indefinite records of user information,[3] automatic facial recognition software,[4][5] and its role in the workplace, including employer-employee account disclosure.[6] The use of Facebook can have negative psychological effects that include feelings of romantic jealousy[7][8] and stress,[9][10] a lack of attention,[11] and social media addiction that in some cases is comparable to drug addiction.[12][13]","image":"Facebook_censored_post.png.webp"}
