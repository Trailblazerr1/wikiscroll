{"title":"Joint probability distribution","summary":"Given random variables X , Y , … {\\displaystyle X,Y,\\ldots } , that are defined on a probability space, the joint probability distribution for X , Y , … {\\displaystyle X,Y,\\ldots } is a probability distribution that gives the probability that each of X , Y , … {\\displaystyle X,Y,\\ldots } falls in any particular range or discrete set of values specified for that variable. In the case of only two random variables, this is called a bivariate distribution, but the concept generalizes to any number of random variables, giving a multivariate distribution.","image":"d0677d20d4752776a420872ba304c72902a82716.svg","url":"Joint_probability_distribution"}
