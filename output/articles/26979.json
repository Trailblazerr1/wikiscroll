{"title":"List of recessions in the United States","summary":"There have been as many as 48 recessions in the United States dating back to the Articles of Confederation, and although economists and historians dispute certain 19th-century recessions,[1] the consensus view among economists and historians is that \"The cyclical volatility of GDP and unemployment was greater before the Great Depression than it has been since the end of World War II.\"[2] Cycles in the country's agricultural production, industrial production, consumption, business investment, and the health of the banking industry contribute to these declines. U.S. recessions have increasingly affected economies on a worldwide scale, especially as countries' economies become more intertwined.","image":"Run_on_the_Seamen's_Savings'_Bank_during_the_Panic_of_1857.png.webp"}
