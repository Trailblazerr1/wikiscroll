{"title":"Topology (electrical circuits)","summary":"The topology of an electronic circuit is the form taken by the network of interconnections of the circuit components.  Different specific values or ratings of the components are regarded as being the same topology.  Topology is not concerned with the physical layout of components in a circuit, nor with their positions on a circuit diagram; similarly to the mathematic concept of topology, it is only concerned with what connections exist between the components.  There may be numerous physical layouts and circuit diagrams that all amount to the same topology.","image":"Tee_topology.svg.png.webp","url":"Topology_(electrical_circuits)"}
