{"title":"Fluoroantimonic acid","summary":"Fluoroantimonic acid is a mixture of hydrogen fluoride and antimony pentafluoride, containing various cations and anions (the simplest being H2F+ and SbFâˆ’6). This substance is a superacid that can be over a billion times stronger than 100% pure sulfuric acid, depending on proportion of its ingredients. It has been shown to protonate even hydrocarbons to afford pentacoordinate carbocations (carbonium ions).[1] Extreme caution needs to be in place when handling fluoroantimonic acid. It is exceptionally corrosive, but can be stored in containers lined with PTFE (Teflon).","image":"H2FSbF6.svg.png.webp","url":"Fluoroantimonic_acid"}
