{"title":"Liana","summary":"A liana is a long-stemmed, woody vine that is rooted in the soil at ground level and uses trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the canopy in search of direct sunlight.[1] The word liana does not refer to a taxonomic grouping, but rather a habit of plant growth â€“ much like tree or shrub. It comes from standard French liane, itself from an Antilles French dialect word meaning to sheave.","image":"Lianas.jpg.webp","url":"Liana"}
