{"title":"Wylie transliteration","summary":"Wylie transliteration is a method for transliterating Tibetan script using only the letters available on a typical English-language typewriter. The system is named for the American scholar Turrell V. Wylie, who created the system and described it in a 1959 paper published in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies.[1] It has subsequently become a standard transliteration scheme in Tibetan studies, especially in the United States.","image":"Turrell_Wylie.png.webp","url":"Wylie_transliteration"}
