{"title":"Covering space","summary":"In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, a covering map (also covering projection) is a continuous function \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n from a topological space \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n to a topological space \n\n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n such that each point in \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n has an open neighborhood evenly covered by \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p}\n  \n (as shown in the image).[1] In this case, \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n  \n is called a covering space and \n  \n    \n      \n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle X}\n  \n the base space of the covering projection. The definition implies that every covering map is a local homeomorphism.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg"}
