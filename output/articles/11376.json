{"title":"Covering space","summary":"In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, a covering map (also covering projection) is a continuous function p {\\displaystyle p} from a topological space C {\\displaystyle C} to a topological space X {\\displaystyle X} such that each point in X {\\displaystyle X} has an open neighborhood evenly covered by p {\\displaystyle p} (as shown in the image).[1] In this case, C {\\displaystyle C} is called a covering space and X {\\displaystyle X} the base space of the covering projection. The definition implies that every covering map is a local homeomorphism.","image":"81eac1e205430d1f40810df36a0edffdc367af36.svg","url":"Covering_space"}
