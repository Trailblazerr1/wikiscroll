{"title":"The Beatles in India","summary":"In February 1968, the English rock band the Beatles travelled to Rishikesh in northern India to take part in a Transcendental Meditation (TM) training course at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The visit followed the group's denunciation of drugs in favour of TM[1] and received widespread media attention. The band's interest in the Maharishi's teachings was led by George Harrison's commitment,[2][3] and it changed Western attitudes about Indian spirituality and encouraged the study of Transcendental Meditation.[4] The visit was also the most productive period for the Beatles' songwriting.","image":"India_relief_location_map.jpg.webp","url":"The_Beatles_in_India"}
