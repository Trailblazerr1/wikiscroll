{"title":"Direct current","summary":"Direct current (DC) is one-directional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of  DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams. The electric current flows in a constant direction, distinguishing it from alternating current (AC). A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current.[1]","image":"Types_of_current.svg.png.webp","url":"Direct_current"}
