{"title":"Haystacks (Monet series)","summary":"Haystacks is the common English title for a series of impressionist paintings by Claude Monet. The principal subject of each painting in the series is stacks of harvested wheat (or possibly barley or oats: the original French title, Les Meules à Giverny, simply means The Stacks at Giverny). The title refers primarily to a twenty-five canvas series (Wildenstein Index Numbers 1266–1290) which Monet began near the end of the summer of 1890 and continued through the following spring, though Monet also produced five earlier paintings using this same stack subject.","image":"Claude_Monet_-_Stacks_of_Wheat_(End_of_Summer)_-_1985.1103_-_Art_Institute_of_Chicago.jpg.webp"}
