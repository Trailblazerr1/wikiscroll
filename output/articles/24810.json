{"title":"King Crimson","summary":"King Crimson are  a progressive rock band formed in 1968 in London, England. They exerted a strong influence on the early 1970s progressive rock movement and continue to inspire subsequent generations of artists across multiple genres. Robert Fripp, the sole remaining founding member, has acted as the primary composer and a driving creative force throughout the band's history. Although he is often viewed as the band's leader, Fripp himself shuns this label. He has been quoted as seeing the group more as \"a way of doing things\", and his role in the group a form of \"quality control\".[1][2] King Crimson has earned a large cult following.[3][4] They were ranked No. 87 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.[5] In 1969, the original King Crimson influenced and altered the approach of contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis.[6] King Crimson has consistently drawn inspiration from a wide variety of music over the years, keeping their work fresh by incorporating elements of Classical music, jazz, folk, heavy metal, gamelan, industrial, Electronic, experimental music, and new wave.","image":"Uncertain_Times_Japan_Tour_2018_Photo_5_(cropped).jpg.webp","url":"King_Crimson"}
