{"title":"Product bundling","summary":"In marketing, product bundling is offering several products or services for sale as one combined product or service package. It is a common feature in many imperfectly competitive product and service markets.[1] Industries engaged in the practice include telecommunications services, financial services, health care, information, and consumer electronics. A software bundle might include a word processor,  spreadsheet, and presentation program into a single office suite. The cable television industry often bundles many TV and movie channels into a single tier or package.  The fast food industry combines separate food items into a \"meal deal\" or \"value meal\".","image":"Scale_of_justice_2.svg.png.webp"}
