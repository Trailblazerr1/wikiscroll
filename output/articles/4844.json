{"title":"Atomic mass","summary":"The atomic mass (ma or m) is the mass of an atom. Although the SI unit of mass is the kilogram (symbol: kg), atomic mass is often expressed in the non-SI unit atomic mass unit (amu) or unified mass (u) or dalton (symbol: Da), where 1 amu or 1 u or 1 Da is defined as 1⁄12 of the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, at rest.[1] The protons and neutrons of the nucleus account for nearly all of the total mass of atoms, with the electrons and nuclear binding energy making minor contributions. Thus, the numeric value of the atomic mass when expressed in daltons has nearly the same value as the mass number. Conversion between mass in kilograms and mass in daltons can be done using the atomic mass constant \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            \n              u\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              (\n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                    \n                      12\n                    \n                  \n                  C\n                \n              \n              )\n            \n            \n              12\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        1\n         \n        \n          \n            D\n            a\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{\\rm {u}}={{m({\\rm {^{12}C}})} \\over {12}}=1\\ {\\rm {Da}}}\n  \n.","image":"c3cbe4188f0b2fa22e3219a70a9b918c36e0fe95.svg"}
