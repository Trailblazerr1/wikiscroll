{"title":"Kale","summary":"Kale (/keÉªl/), or leaf cabbage, belongs to a group of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) cultivars  grown for their edible leaves, although some are used as ornamentals. Kale plants have green or purple leaves, and the central leaves do not form a head (as with headed cabbage). Kales are considered to be closer to wild cabbage than most of the many domesticated forms of Brassica oleracea.[1]","image":"Boerenkool.jpg.webp"}
