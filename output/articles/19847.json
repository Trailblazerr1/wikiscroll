{"title":"Health equity","summary":"Health equity arises from access to the social determinants of health, specifically from wealth, power and prestige.[1] Individuals who have consistently been deprived of these three determinants are significantly disadvantaged from health inequities, and face worse health outcomes than those who are able to access certain resources.[2][1] It is not equity to simply provide every individual with the same resources; that would be equality. In order to achieve health equity, resources must be allocated based on an individual need-based principle.[1]","image":"Health_gap_in_England_and_Wales%2C_2011_Census.png.webp","url":"Health_equity"}
