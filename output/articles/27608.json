{"title":"Lumbar vertebrae","summary":"The lumbar vertebrae are, in human anatomy, the five vertebrae between the rib cage and the pelvis. They are the largest segments of the vertebral column and are characterized by the absence of the foramen transversarium within the transverse process (since it is only found in the cervical region) and by the absence of facets on the sides of the body (as found only in the thoracic region). They are designated L1 to L5, starting at the top.  The lumbar vertebrae help support the weight of the body, and permit movement.","image":"Lumbar_vertebrae_anterior.png.webp"}
