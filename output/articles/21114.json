{"title":"Huntington's disease","summary":"Huntington's disease (HD), also known as Huntington's chorea, is a neurodegenerative disease that is mostly inherited.[7] The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities.[1] A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow.[2] It is also a basal ganglia disease causing a hyperkinetic movement disorder known as chorea.[8][9] As the disease advances, uncoordinated, involuntary body movements of chorea become more apparent.[1] Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk.[1][2] Mental abilities generally decline into dementia.[3] The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people.[1] Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age but can start at any age.[3][4] The disease may develop earlier in each successive generation.[1] About eight percent of cases start before the age of 20 years, and are known as juvenile HD, which typically present with the slow movement symptoms of Parkinson's disease rather than those of chorea.[3]","image":"Neuron_with_mHtt_inclusion.jpg.webp","url":"Huntington's_disease"}
