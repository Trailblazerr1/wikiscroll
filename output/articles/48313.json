{"title":"Wet nurse","summary":"A wet nurse is a woman who breast feeds and cares for another's child.[1] Wet nurses are employed if the mother dies, or if she is unable or chooses not to nurse the child herself. Wet-nursed children may be known as \"milk-siblings\", and in some cultures the families are linked by a special relationship of milk kinship. Wetnursing existed in cultures around the world until the invention of reliable formula milk in the 20th century. The practice has made a small comeback in the 21st century.","image":"Louis_XIV_as_an_infant_with_his_nurse_Longuet_de_la_Giraudiere.jpg.webp","url":"Wet_nurse"}
