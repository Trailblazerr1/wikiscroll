{"title":"Saif Ali Khan","summary":"Saif Ali Khan (pronounced [ˈsɛːf əˈli xaːn]; born Sajid Ali Khan Pataudi on 16 August 1970)[1] is an Indian actor and producer who works in Hindi films. The son of actress Sharmila Tagore and cricketer Mansoor Ali Khan, Khan made his acting debut in Yash Chopra's drama Parampara (1993), but achieved success with his roles in the romantic drama Yeh Dillagi and the action film Main Khiladi Tu Anari (both 1994). Khan's career prospect declined through much of the 1990s, and his biggest commercial success of the decade came with the ensemble family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999). He rose to prominence with roles in two ensemble comedy-dramas—Dil Chahta Hai (2001) and Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003).","image":"Saif_Ali_Khan_promoting_Jawaani_Jaaneman.jpeg.webp"}
