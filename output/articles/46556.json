{"title":"Uncertainty principle","summary":"In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities[1] asserting a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which the values for certain pairs of physical quantities of a particle, such as position, x, and momentum, p, can be predicted from initial conditions.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg","url":"Uncertainty_principle"}
