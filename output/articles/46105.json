{"title":"Tube map","summary":"The Tube map (sometimes called the London Underground map or the TfL services map) is a schematic transport map of the lines, stations and services of the London Underground, known colloquially as \"the Tube\", hence the map's name. The first schematic Tube map was designed by Harry Beck in 1931.[1][2] Since then, it has been expanded to include more of London's public transport systems, including the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, TfL Rail, Tramlink, the Emirates Air Line cable car and Thameslink.","image":"London_Tube_Map.png.webp","url":"Tube_map"}
