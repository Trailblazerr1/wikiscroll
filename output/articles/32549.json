{"title":"Nunavut","summary":"Nunavut /ˈnʊnəˌvʊt, ˈnuːnəˌvuːt/ (Inuktitut: ᓄᓇᕗᑦ [nunaˈvut]; French: [nunavut]) is the largest and northernmost territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act[9] and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act,[10] which provided this territory to the Inuit for independent government. The boundaries had been drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the province of Newfoundland was admitted in 1949.","image":"Flag_of_Nunavut.svg.png.webp","url":"Nunavut"}
