{"title":"Imagism","summary":"Imagism was a movement in early-20th-century Anglo-American poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear, sharp language. It is considered to be the first organized modernist literary movement in the English language.[1]  Imagism is sometimes viewed as \"a succession of creative moments\" rather than a continuous or sustained period of development. The French academic Ren√© Taupin remarked that \"it is more accurate to consider Imagism not as a doctrine, nor even as a poetic school, but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles\".[2]","image":"Ezra_Pound_by_Alvin_Langdon_Coburn%2C_1913.jpg.webp"}
