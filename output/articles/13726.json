{"title":"Ductility","summary":"Ductility is a mechanical property commonly described as a material's amenability to drawing (e.g. into wire).[1] In materials science, ductility is defined by the degree to which a material can sustain plastic deformation under tensile stress before failure.[2][3] Ductility is an important consideration in engineering and manufacturing, defining a material's suitability for certain manufacturing operations (such as cold working) and its capacity to absorb mechanical overload.[4] Materials that are generally described as ductile include gold and copper.[5]","image":"Al_tensile_test.jpg.webp"}
