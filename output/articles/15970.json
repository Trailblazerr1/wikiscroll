{"title":"Female genital mutilation","summary":"Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital cutting, female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and female circumcision,[lower-alpha 1] is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. The practice is found in some countries of Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities abroad from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated, in 2016, that 200 million women in 30 countries—Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan, Yemen, and 27 African countries—had been subjected to one or more types of FGM.[3]","image":"Campaign_road_sign_against_female_genital_mutilation_(cropped)_2.jpg.webp","url":"Female_genital_mutilation"}
