{"title":"Humanities","summary":"Humanities are academic disciplines that study aspects of human society and culture. In the Renaissance, the term contrasted with divinity and referred to what is now called classics, the main area of secular study in universities at the time. Today, the humanities are more frequently defined as any fields of study outside of professional training, mathematics, and the natural and  social sciences.[1]","image":"Head_Platon_Glyptothek_Munich_548.jpg.webp","url":"Humanities"}
