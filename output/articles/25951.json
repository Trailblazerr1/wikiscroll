{"title":"Leslie speaker","summary":"The Leslie speaker is a combined amplifier and loudspeaker that projects the signal from an electric or electronic instrument and modifies the sound by rotating a baffle chamber (\"drum\") in front of the loudspeakers. A similar effect is provided by a rotating system of horns in front of the treble driver.  It is most commonly associated with the Hammond organ, though it was later used for the electric guitar and other instruments. A typical Leslie speaker contains an amplifier, a treble horn and a bass speakerâ€”though specific components depend upon the model. A musician controls the Leslie speaker by either an external switch or pedal that alternates between a slow and fast speed setting, known as \"chorale\" and \"tremolo\".","image":"Leslie_Speaker.jpg.webp","url":"Leslie_speaker"}
