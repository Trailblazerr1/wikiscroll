{"title":"Female ejaculation","summary":"Female ejaculation is characterized as an expulsion of fluid from the Skene's gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm. It is also known colloquially as squirting (or gushing), although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena,  squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine.[1][2] Female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence, with which it is sometimes confused.[3][4]","image":"Skenes_gland.jpg.webp","url":"Female_ejaculation"}
