{"title":"Plateosaurus","summary":"Plateosaurus (probably meaning \"broad lizard\", often mistranslated as \"flat lizard\") is a genus of plateosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Late Triassic period, around 214 to 204 million years ago, in what is now Central and Northern Europe and Greenland, North America. Plateosaurus is a basal (early) sauropodomorph dinosaur, a so-called \"prosauropod\". In 2019, the ICZN replaced the former type species P. engelhardti with P. trossingensis due to the former being undiagnostic. Currently, there are three valid species, P. trossingensis, P. longiceps, and P. gracilis. However, others have been assigned in the past, and there is no broad consensus on the species taxonomy of plateosaurid dinosaurs. Similarly, there are a plethora of synonyms (invalid duplicate names) at the genus level.","image":"Plateosaurus_Skelett_2.jpg.webp","url":"Plateosaurus"}
