{"title":"Annexation of Goa","summary":"The Annexation of Goa was the process in which the Republic of India annexed Estado da India, the then Portuguese Indian territories of Goa, Daman and Diu, starting with the armed action carried out by the Indian Armed Forces in December 1961. In India, this action is referred to as the \"Liberation of Goa\". In Portugal, it is referred to as the \"Invasion of Goa\". Jawaharlal Nehru had hoped that the popular movement in Goa and the pressure of world public opinion would force the Portuguese Goan authorities to grant it independence but since it did not have any effect, he decided to liberate it.[5] Dadra and Nagar Haveli had already been declared independent by the locals.","image":"IN-GA.svg.png.webp"}
