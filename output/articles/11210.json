{"title":"Corn snake","summary":"The corn snake (Pantherophis guttatus) is a North American species of rat snake that subdues its small prey by constriction.[4][5] It is found throughout the southeastern and central United States.  Though superficially resembling the venomous copperhead and often killed as a result of this mistaken identity, corn snakes lack functional venom and are harmless. Corn snakes are beneficial to humans [6] by helping to control populations of wild rodent pests that damage crops and spread disease.[7]","image":"CornSnake.jpg.webp"}
