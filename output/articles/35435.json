{"title":"Polyester","summary":"Polyester is a category of polymers that contain the ester functional group in every repeat unit of their main chain.[1] As a specific material, it most commonly refers to a type called polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Polyesters include naturally occurring chemicals, in plants and insects, as well as synthetics such as polybutyrate. Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. Synthetic polyesters are used extensively in clothing.","image":"Definition_polyester_ester_group.svg.png.webp"}
