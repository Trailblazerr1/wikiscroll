{"title":"Pentium D","summary":"The Pentium D[2] brand refers to two series of desktop dual-core 64-bit x86-64 microprocessors with the NetBurst microarchitecture, which is the dual-core variant of Pentium 4 \"Prescott\" manufactured by Intel. Each CPU comprised two dies, each containing a single core, residing next to each other on a multi-chip module package. The brand's first processor, codenamed Smithfield, was released by Intel on May 25, 2005. Nine months later, Intel introduced its successor, codenamed Presler,[3] but without offering significant upgrades in design,[4] still resulting in relatively high power consumption.[5] By 2004, the NetBurst processors reached a clock speed barrier at 3.8Â GHz due to a thermal (and power) limit exemplified by the Presler's 130 watt thermal design power[5] (a higher TDP requires additional cooling that can be prohibitively noisy or expensive). The future belonged to more energy efficient and slower clocked dual-core CPUs on a single die instead of two.[6] The final shipment date of the dual die Presler chips was August 8, 2008,[7] which marked the end of the Pentium D brand and also the NetBurst microarchitecture.","image":"Intel_Pentium_D_930_with_i945GC_chipset.jpg.webp","url":"Pentium_D"}
