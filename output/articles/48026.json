{"title":"Water organ","summary":"The water organ or hydraulic organ (Greek: ὕδραυλις) (early types are sometimes called hydraulos, hydraulus or hydraula) is a type of pipe organ blown by air, where the power source pushing the air is derived by water from a natural source (e.g. by a waterfall) or by a manual pump.  Consequently, the water organ lacks a bellows, blower, or compressor.","image":"Mosaique_Zliten.jpg.webp"}
