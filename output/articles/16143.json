{"title":"Filioque","summary":"Filioque (/ˌfɪliˈoʊkwi, -kweɪ/ FIL-ee-OH-kwee, -⁠kway; Ecclesiastical Latin: [filiˈokwe]) is a Latin term (\"and from the Son\") added to the original Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed (commonly known as the Nicene Creed), and which has been the subject of great controversy between Eastern and Western Christianity. It is a term that refers to the Son, Jesus Christ, as an additional origin point of the Holy Spirit. It is not in the original text of the Creed, attributed to the First Council of Constantinople (381), which says that the Holy Spirit proceeds \"from the Father\", without additions of any kind, such as \"and the Son\" or \"alone\".[1]","image":"Filioque.JPG.webp","url":"Filioque"}
