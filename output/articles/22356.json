{"title":"Invasive species","summary":"An invasive species is an introduced organism that becomes overpopulated and negatively alters its new environment.[2] Although their spread can have beneficial aspects, invasive species adversely affect the invaded habitats and bioregions, causing ecological, environmental, and/or economic damage.[3] Sometimes the term is used for native species that become invasive within certain ecosystems due to human alterations of the environment. An example of a native invasive species is the purple sea urchin which has decimated natural kelp forests along the northern California coast due to the historic overhunting of its natural predator, the California sea otter.[4] In the 21st century, invasive species have become a serious economic, social, and environmental threat.","image":"Beaver_dam_in_Tierra_del_Fuego.jpg.webp"}
