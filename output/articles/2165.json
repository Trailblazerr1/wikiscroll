{"title":"Address bar","summary":"In a web browser, the address bar (also location bar or URL bar) is a GUI widget that shows the current URL. The user can type a URL into the bar to navigate to a chosen website; in most modern browsers, non-URLs are automatically sent to a search engine. In a file browser, it serves the same purpose of navigation, but through the file-system hierarchy.","image":"HTTPS_and_padlock_in_website_address_bar.jpg.webp"}
