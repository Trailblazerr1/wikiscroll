{"title":"Metamorphic rock","summary":"Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock to new types of rock, in a process called metamorphism. The original rock (protolith) is subjected to temperatures greater than 150 to 200 °C (300 to 400 °F) and, often, elevated pressure of 100 megapascals (1,000 bar) or more, causing profound physical or chemical changes. During this process, the rock remains mostly in the solid state, but gradually recrystallizes to a new texture or mineral composition.[1] The protolith may be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock.","image":"Quartzite.jpg.webp","url":"Metamorphic_rock"}
