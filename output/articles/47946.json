{"title":"Warkworth Castle","summary":"Warkworth Castle is a ruined medieval castle in Warkworth in the English county of Northumberland. The village and castle occupy a loop of the River Coquet, less than a mile from England's north-east coast. When the castle was founded is uncertain: traditionally its construction has been ascribed to Prince Henry of Scotland, Earl of Northumbria, in the mid-12th century, but it may have been built by King Henry II of England when he took control of England's northern counties. Warkworth Castle was first documented in a charter of 1157–1164 when Henry II granted it to Roger fitz Richard. The timber castle was considered \"feeble\", and was left undefended when the Scots invaded in 1173.","image":"Warkworth_Castle_interior%2C_2007.jpg.webp","url":"Warkworth_Castle"}
