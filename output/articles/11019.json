{"title":"Constructed language","summary":"A constructed language (sometimes called a conlang)[2] is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary, instead of having developed naturally, are consciously devised or invented as a work of fiction. Constructed languages may also be referred to as artificial languages, planned languages or invented languages[3] and in some cases, fictional languages. Planned languages are languages that have been purposefully designed. They are the result of deliberate controlling intervention, thus of a form of language planning.[4]","image":"Conlangflag.svg.png.webp","url":"Constructed_language"}
