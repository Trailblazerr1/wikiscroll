{"title":"Black people","summary":"Black people is a racialized classification of people, usually a political and skin color-based category for specific populations with a mid to dark brown complexion. Not all people considered \"black\" have dark skin; in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification in the Western world, the term \"black\" is used to describe persons who are perceived as dark-skinned compared to other populations. It is mostly used for people of Sub-Saharan African descent and the indigenous peoples of Oceania. Indigenous African societies do not use the term black as a racial identity outside of influences brought by Western cultures. The term \"black\" may or may not be capitalized.[1][2] The AP Stylebook changed its guide to capitalize the \"b\" in black in 2020.[1][2] The ASA Style Guide says that the \"b\" should not be capitalized.[3]","image":"African_slave_trade.png.webp","url":"Black_people"}
