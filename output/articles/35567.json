{"title":"Porcelain","summary":"Porcelain (/ˈpɔːrsəlɪn/) is a ceramic material made by heating substances, generally including materials such as kaolinite, in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 and 1,400 °C (2,200 and 2,600 °F). The strength, and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arises mainly from vitrification and formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures.  Though definitions vary, porcelain can be divided into three main categories: hard-paste, soft-paste and bone china. The category that an object belongs to depends on the composition of the paste used to make the body of the porcelain object and the firing conditions.","image":"Chinese_-_Flask_-_Walters_491632_(square).jpg.webp","url":"Porcelain"}
