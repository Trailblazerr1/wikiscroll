{"title":"Moirai","summary":"In ancient Greek religion and mythology, the Moirai (/ˈmɔɪraɪ, -riː/, also spelled Moirae or Mœræ;[1][2] Ancient Greek: Μοῖραι, \"lots, destinies, apportioners\"), often known in English as the Fates (Latin: Fata), were the incarnations of destiny; their Roman equivalent was the Parcae (euphemistically the \"sparing ones\"), and there are other equivalents in cultures that descend from the Proto-Indo-European culture. Their number became fixed at three: Clotho (\"spinner\"), Lachesis (\"allotter\") and Atropos (\"the unturnable\", a metaphor for death).","image":"Greek_Roman_Laurel_wreath_with_branches_vector.svg.png.webp","url":"Moirai"}
