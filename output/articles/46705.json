{"title":"United States Department of Justice","summary":"The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive department of the United States government tasked with  the enforcement of federal law and administration of justice in the United States. It is equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries. The modern incarnation of the department was formed in 1870 during the Ulysses S. Grant presidency. The department is composed of federal law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The primary actions of the DOJ are investigating instances of white collar crime, representing the U.S. government in legal matters (such as in cases before the Supreme Court), and running the federal prison system.[7][8] The department is also responsible for reviewing the conduct of local law enforcement as directed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.[9]","image":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Justice.svg.png.webp"}
