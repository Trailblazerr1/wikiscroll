{"title":"Warg","summary":"In Norse mythology, a vargr (often anglicised as warg) is a wolf, especially the wolf Fenrir and the wolves Sk√∂ll and Hati, that chase the sun and moon. Based on this, J. R. R. Tolkien in his fiction used the form  warg, which may incorporate Old English wearh, as the name of a particularly large and evil kind of wolf that could be ridden by orcs. Through Tolkien's influence, the concept has been used in fantasy works by other authors and in other media.","image":"Rune_stone_dr_284_of_the_hunnestad_monument_in_lund_sweden_2008_(cropped).JPG.webp"}
