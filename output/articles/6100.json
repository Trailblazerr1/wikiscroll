{"title":"Before Present","summary":"Before Present (BP) years, or \"years before present\" is a time scale used mainly in archaeology, geology and other scientific disciplines to specify when events occurred before the origin of practical radiocarbon dating in the 1950s. Because the \"present\" time changes, standard practice is to use 1 January 1950 as the commencement date (epoch) of the age scale.[lower-alpha 1] The abbreviation \"BP\" has been interpreted retrospectively as \"Before Physics\",[1] which refers to the time before nuclear weapons testing artificially altered the proportion of the carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, making carbon dating after that time likely to be unreliable.[2][3]","image":"Symbol_list_class.svg.png.webp"}
