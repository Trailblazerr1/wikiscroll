The city had a population of 722,664 according to the 2006 Nigerian census. The name Enugu is derived from the two Igbo words Énú Ụ́gwụ́ meaning \"hill top\" denoting the city's hilly geography. The city was named after Enugwu Ngwuo, under which coal was found.\nEnugwu Ngwuo is one of the ten villages that made up the Ngwuo clan, often referred to as the children of Ngwuako, the ancestral founder of the clan.         Ngwuako positioned Udeneogu, his warrior son of on top of the hill (Enu-Ugwu) to protect the clan from invaders. Enugwu Ama Udeneogu, (Enugwu, the land of Udeneogu) \nThe people lived on the hilltop and farmed the sprawling surrounding valleys.\nNgwuo has borders with Oshie clan in the south, Ojebeogene clan in the north and Nkanu clan in the east.\nThe discovery of coal deposits on Enugwu Ngwuo farm lands down the valley, attracted people from all and sundry to the newly discovered  wealth, in search for means of living, and as depicted in the map of the original plan for a government station, titled Enugwu Ngwo government station, this marked the core of the first urban  settlement of what is today known as Enugu, started on Ngwuo land and it was called Enugwu Ngwuo until when it attained township status, the word Ngwo was removed for the convenience of pronunciation, thus a village of Ngwuo clan gave birth to a city which today has grown into a mega city, and still growing, engulfing the surrounding Nkanu towns of Nike and Akunino and stretching towards Neke and Emene.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
