{"title":"Music Box (Mariah Carey album)","summary":"Music Box is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. It was released by Columbia Records on August 31, 1993, in North America. The album comprises ballads primarily written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, with whom she had previously worked on Emotions (1991), and a few urban dance tracks. During the course of the album's development, Carey wanted to broaden her audience, choosing a more pop/R&B oriented sound. During this time frame, she experimented with different musical instruments, leading the album's sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts. Two additional tracks from the album sessions were released, with \"Do You Think of Me?\" serving as the B-side to \"Dreamlover\" and \"Everything Fades Away\" and being featured on international editions of Music Box.","image":"Music_Box_Mariah_Carey.png.webp"}
