{"title":"Black Death","summary":"The Black Death (also known as the Pestilence, the Great Mortality or the Plague[lower-alpha 1]) was a bubonic plague pandemic occurring in Afro-Eurasia from 1346 to 1353. It is the most fatal pandemic recorded in human history, causing the death of 75â€“200 million people in Eurasia and North Africa, peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351.[1][2] Bubonic plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis spread by fleas, but it can also take a secondary form where it is spread person-to-person contact via aerosols causing septicaemic or pneumonic plagues.[3][4]","image":"1346-1353_spread_of_the_Black_Death_in_Europe_map.svg.png.webp"}
