{"title":"Piedmont Park","summary":"Piedmont Park is an urban park in Atlanta, Georgia, located about 1 mile (1.6Â km) northeast of Downtown, between the Midtown and Virginia Highland neighborhoods. Originally the land was owned by Dr. Benjamin Walker, who used it as his out-of-town gentleman's farm and residence. He sold the land in 1887 to the Gentlemen's Driving Club (later renamed the Piedmont Driving Club), who wanted to establish an exclusive club and racing ground for horse enthusiasts. The Driving Club entered an agreement with the Piedmont Exposition Company, headed by prominent Atlantan Charles A. Collier, to use the land for fairs and expositions and later gave the park its name.","image":"Midtown_HDR_Atlanta.jpg.webp","url":"Piedmont_Park"}
