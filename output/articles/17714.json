{"title":"Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou","summary":"Geoffrey V (24 August 1113 – 7 September 1151), called the Handsome, the Fair (French: le Bel) or Plantagenet, was the count of Anjou, Touraine and Maine by inheritance from 1129, and also the duke of Normandy by conquest from 1144. His marriage to Empress Matilda, daughter of King Henry I of England, led to the centuries-long reign of the Plantagenet dynasty in England. The name \"Plantagenet\" was taken from Geoffrey's epithet.  Geoffrey's ancestral domain of Anjou gave rise to the name Angevin, and what became known as the Angevin Empire in the 12th century.","image":"Geoffrey_of_Anjou_Monument.jpg.webp"}
