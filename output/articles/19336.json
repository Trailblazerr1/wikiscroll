{"title":"Habanero","summary":"The habanero (/ˌ(h)ɑːbəˈnɛəroʊ/; Spanish: [aβaˈneɾo] (listen)) is a hot variety of chili. Unripe habaneros are green, and they color as they mature. The most common color variants are orange and red, but the fruit may also be white, brown, yellow, green, or purple.[1] Typically, a ripe habanero is 2–6 centimetres (3⁄4–2+1⁄4 inches) long. Habanero chilis are very hot, rated 100,000–350,000 on the Scoville scale.[2] The habanero's heat, flavor and floral aroma make it a popular ingredient in hot sauces and other spicy foods.","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
