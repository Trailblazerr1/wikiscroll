{"title":"Vietnamese boat people","summary":"Vietnamese boat people (Vietnamese: Thuyền nhân Việt Nam), also known simply as boat people, refers to the refugees who fled Vietnam by boat and ship following the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. This migration and humanitarian crisis was at its highest in 1978 and 1979, but continued through the early 1990s. The term is also often used generically to refer to the Vietnamese people who left their country in mass exodus between 1975 and 1995 (see Indochina refugee crisis). This article uses the term \"boat people\" to apply only to those who fled Vietnam by sea.","image":"35_Vietnamese_boat_people_2.JPEG.webp"}
