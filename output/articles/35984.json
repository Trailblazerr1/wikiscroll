{"title":"Priesthood in the Catholic Church","summary":"The priesthood is the office of the ministers of religion, who have been commissioned (\"ordained\") with the Holy orders of the Catholic Church. Technically, bishops and deacons are priestly orders as well, however in layman's terms priest refers only to presbyters and pastors (parish priests). The church's doctrine also sometimes refers to all baptised (lay) members as the \"common priesthood\",[1][2] which must not be confused with the ministerial priesthood of the consecrated clergy.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp","url":"Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church"}
