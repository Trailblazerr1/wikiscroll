{"title":"Wētā","summary":"Wētā (also spelled weta) is the common name for a group of about 70 insect species in the families Anostostomatidae and Rhaphidophoridae, endemic to New Zealand. They are giant flightless crickets, and some are among the heaviest insects in the world. Generally nocturnal, most small species are carnivores and scavengers while the larger species are herbivorous.[1] Wētā are preyed on by introduced mammals, and some species are now critically endangered.","image":"Male_tree_weta-orig.jpg.webp"}
