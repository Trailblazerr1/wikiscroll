{"title":"Nova","summary":"A nova (plural novae or novas) is a transient astronomical event that causes the sudden appearance of a bright, apparently \"new\" star, that slowly fades over several weeks or many months. Causes of the dramatic appearance of a nova vary, depending on the circumstances of the two progenitor stars. All observed novae involve a white dwarf in a close binary system. The main sub-classes of novae are classical novae, recurrent novae (RNe), and dwarf novae. They are all considered to be cataclysmic variable stars.","image":"Making_a_Nova.jpg.webp"}
