{"title":"Women's suffrage","summary":"Women's suffrage is the right of women to vote in elections. Beginning in the mid-19th century, aside from the work being done by women for broad-based economic and political equality and for social reforms, women sought to change voting laws to allow them to vote. National and international organizations formed to coordinate efforts towards that objective, especially the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (founded in 1904 in Berlin, Germany), as well as for equal civil rights for women.[1]","image":"Official_program_-_Woman_suffrage_procession_March_3%2C_1913_-_crop.jpg.webp"}
