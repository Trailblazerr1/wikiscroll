{"title":"Start codon","summary":"The start codon is the first codon of a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript translated by a ribosome. The start codon always codes for methionine in eukaryotes and Archaea and a N-formylmethionine (fMet) in bacteria, mitochondria and plastids. The most common start codon is AUG (i.e., ATG in the corresponding DNA sequence).","image":"Homo_sapiens-mtDNA~NC_012920-ATP8%2BATP6_Overlap.svg.png.webp"}
