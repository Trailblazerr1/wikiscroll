{"title":"Generalized Stokes theorem","summary":"In vector calculus and differential geometry the generalized Stokes theorem (sometimes with apostrophe as Stokes' theorem or Stokes's theorem), also called the Stokesâ€“Cartan theorem,[1] is a statement about the integration of differential forms on manifolds, which both simplifies and generalizes several theorems from vector calculus.  It is a generalization of Isaac Newton's fundamental theorem of calculus that relates two-dimensional line integrals to three-dimensional surface integrals.[2]","image":"6b2bdb20e9b3f3bb0b09035eacff69dc6ff55767.svg","url":"Generalized_Stokes_theorem"}
