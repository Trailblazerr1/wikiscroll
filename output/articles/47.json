Registrants of .us domains must be U.S. citizens, residents, or organizations, or a foreign entity with a presence in the United States.[2] Most registrants in the U.S. have registered for .com, .net, .org and other gTLDs, instead of .us, which has primarily been used by state and local governments, even though private entities may also register .us domains.[3]","image":"DotUS_domain_logo.png.webp"}
