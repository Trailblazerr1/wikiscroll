{"title":"Pran (actor)","summary":"Pran Krishan Sikand (12 February 1920 – 12 July 2013), better known by his mononym, Pran, was an Indian actor, known as the greatest villain ever in the history of Indian cinema and character actor in Hindi cinema from the 1940s to the 1990s.[1] He played hero roles from 1940–47, a villain from 1942–1991, and played supporting and character roles from 1967–2007. The decades of late 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s were the peak periods of Pran's villainy, especially 1950s & 1960s. Pran was the first true personifiation of \"evil\" on the Indian screen. He is the original badman of Indian cinema. The intensity of his portrayal of negative/villainous characters on the screen was effective enough to desist the Indian people from naming their children \"Pran\" in the 1950s & 60s & subsequently thereafter (when Pran was at the peak of his villainy). He has been one among the most highly successful & respected veteran actors in the history of Indian cinema. He was also one among the highest paid actors of his time.","image":"Pran.jpg.webp"}
