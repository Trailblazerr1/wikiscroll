{"title":"Carom billiards","summary":"Carom billiards, sometimes called carambole billiards, is the overarching title of a family of cue sports generally played on cloth-covered, pocketless billiard tables. In its simplest form, the object of the game is to score points or \"counts\" by caroming one's own cue ball off both the opponent's cue ball and the object ball on a single shot. The invention as well as the exact date of origin of carom billiards is somewhat obscure but is thought to be traceable to 18th-century France.[1]","image":"Hearst_Castle_Casa_Grande_interior_September_2012_006.jpg.webp","url":"Carom_billiards"}
