{"title":"Pain in crustaceans","summary":"The question of whether crustaceans experience pain is a matter of scientific debate.  Pain is a complex mental state, with a distinct perceptual quality but also associated with suffering, which is an emotional state. Because of this complexity, the presence of pain in an animal, or another human for that matter, cannot be determined unambiguously using observational methods, but the conclusion that animals experience pain is often inferred on the basis of likely presence of phenomenal consciousness which is deduced from comparative brain physiology as well as physical and behavioural reactions.[1][2]","image":"Lobster_08.jpg.webp","url":"Pain_in_crustaceans"}
