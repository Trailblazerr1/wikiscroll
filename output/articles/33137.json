{"title":"Operation Torch","summary":"Operation Torch (8 November 1942 â€“ 16 November 1942) was an Allied invasion of French North Africa during the Second World War.[5] While the French colonies formally aligned with Germany via Vichy France, the loyalties of the population were mixed.  Reports indicated that they might support the Allies. American General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied forces in Mediterranean Theater of Operations, planned a three-pronged attack on Casablanca (Western), Oran (Center) and Algiers (Eastern), then a rapid move on Tunis to catch Axis forces in North Africa from the west in conjunction with Allied advance from east.","image":"Operation_Torch_-_map.jpg.webp"}
