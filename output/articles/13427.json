{"title":"Doo-Wops & Hooligans","summary":"Doo-Wops & Hooligans is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. It was released on October 4, 2010, by Atlantic and Elektra Records. After the release of the EP It's Better If You Don't Understand (2010), Mars's writing and production team, the Smeezingtons, began working on the album with Needlz, Supa Dups and Jeff Bhasker as producers. Doo-Wops & Hooligans draws on a variety of influences. Lyrically, the album visualizes carefree optimism along with failed relationships, pain and loneliness. It was promoted primarily through the Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010–2012) and a co-headline tour with Janelle Monáe, called Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011), along with a number of television appearances. The album title was chosen to reflect simplicity and appeal to males and females.","image":"Bruno_Mars_-_Doo-Wops_%26_Hooligans.png.webp","url":"Doo-Wops_&_Hooligans"}
