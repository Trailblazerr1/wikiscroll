{"title":"Khat","summary":"Khat or qat (Amharic: ጫት ch’at; Oromo: Jimaa, Somali: qaad, khaad or khat, Arabic: القات‎ al-qāt) is a flowering plant native to East Hararghe Zone and West Hararghe Zone of Ethiopia. Khat contains the alkaloid cathinone, a stimulant, which is said to cause excitement, loss of appetite, and euphoria. Among communities from the areas where the plant is native, khat chewing has a history as a social custom dating back thousands of years analogous to the use of coca leaves in South America and betel nut in Asia.[2]","image":"Catha_edulis.jpg.webp"}
