{"title":"Feather","summary":"Feathers are epidermal growths that form a distinctive outer covering, or plumage, on dinosaurs, both avian (bird) and some non-avian (non-bird) and possibly other archosauromorphs. They are considered the most complex integumentary structures found in vertebrates[1][2] and a premier example of a complex evolutionary novelty.[3] They are among the characteristics that distinguish the extant birds from other living groups.[4]","image":"Types_de_plumes._-_Larousse_pour_tous%2C_-1907-1910-.jpg.webp"}
