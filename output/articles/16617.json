{"title":"Footbridge","summary":"A footbridge (also a pedestrian bridge, pedestrian overpass, or pedestrian overcrossing) is a bridge designed solely for pedestrians.[1] While the primary meaning for a bridge is a structure which links \"two points at a height above the ground\", a footbridge can also be a lower structure, such as a boardwalk, that enables pedestrians to cross wet, fragile, or marshy land.[2] Bridges range from stepping stones–possibly the earliest man-made structure to \"bridge\" water–to elaborate steel structures. Another early bridge would have been simply a fallen tree. In some cases a footbridge can be both functional and artistic.","image":"Wooden_footbridge_in_Luang_Prabang_with_a_worker_busy_at_its_consolidation.jpg.webp","url":"Footbridge"}
