{"title":"Habitat","summary":"In ecology, the term habitat summarises the array of resources, physical and biotic factors that are present in an area, such as to support the survival and reproduction of a particular species. A species habitat can be seen as the physical manifestation of its ecological niche. Thus \"habitat\" is a species-specific term, fundamentally different from concepts such as environment or vegetation assemblages, for which the term \"habitat-type\" is more appropriate.","image":"Rotjan_-_Enderbury_Day_1_-_2nd_half_(62).JPG.webp","url":"Habitat"}
