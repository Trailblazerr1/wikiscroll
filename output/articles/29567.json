Written by Thea von Harbou in collaboration with Lang[5][6] from von Harbou's 1925 novel of the same name. Intentionally written as a treatment, it stars Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel, Rudolf Klein-Rogge, and Brigitte Helm. Erich Pommer produced it in the Babelsberg Studios for Universum Film A.G. (UFA). The silent film is regarded as a pioneering science-fiction movie, being among the first feature-length movies of that genre.[7] Filming took place over 17 months in 1925–26 at a cost of more than five million Reichsmarks,[8] or the equivalent of about €19,000,000 in 2020.[9]","image":"Metropolis_(German_three-sheet_poster).jpg.webp","url":"Metropolis_(1927_film)"}
