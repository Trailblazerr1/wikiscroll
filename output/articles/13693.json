{"title":"Dryopithecus","summary":"Dryopithecus is a genus of extinct great apes from the middleâ€“late Miocene boundary of Europe 12.5 to 11.1 million years ago (mya). Since its discovery in 1856, the genus has been subject to taxonomic turmoil, with numerous new species being described from single remains based on minute differences amongst each other, and the fragmentary nature of the holotype specimen makes differentiating remains difficult. There is currently only one uncontested species, the type species D. fontani, though there may be more. The genus is placed into the tribe Dryopithecini, which is either an offshoot of orangutans, African apes, or is its own separate branch.","image":"Dryopithecus_fontani_mio_med_francia.JPG.webp","url":"Dryopithecus"}
