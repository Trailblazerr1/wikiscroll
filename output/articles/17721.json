{"title":"Geographic tongue","summary":"Geographic tongue, also known by several other terms,[note 1] is a condition of the mucous membrane of the tongue, usually on the dorsal surface. It is a common condition, affecting approximately 2â€“3% of the general population.[2][7] It is characterized by areas of smooth, red depapillation (loss of lingual papillae) which migrate over time. The name comes from the map-like appearance of the tongue,[8] with the patches resembling the islands of an archipelago.[2] The cause is unknown, but the condition is entirely benign (importantly, it does not represent oral cancer), and there is no curative treatment. Uncommonly, geographic tongue may cause a burning sensation on the tongue, for which various treatments have been described with little formal evidence of efficacy.","image":"Landkartenzunge_005.jpg.webp"}
