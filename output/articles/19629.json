{"title":"Haredi Judaism","summary":"Haredi Judaism (Hebrew: יהדות חֲרֵדִית‎ Yehadut Ḥaredit, IPA: [ħaʁeˈdi]; also spelled Charedi in English; plural Haredim or Charedim) consists of groups within Orthodox Judaism which are characterized by their strict adherence to halakha (Jewish law) and traditions, in opposition to modern values and practices.[1][2] Its members are usually referred to as ultra-Orthodox in English; however, the term \"ultra-Orthodox\" is considered pejorative by many of its adherents, who prefer terms like strictly Orthodox or Haredi.[3] Haredi Jews regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of Jews,[4][5] although other streams of Judaism disagree.[6]","image":"MORNING_TORA_READING.jpg.webp"}
