{"title":"Kriging","summary":"In statistics, originally in geostatistics, kriging or Kriging, also known as Gaussian process regression, is a method of interpolation based on Gaussian process governed by prior covariances.  Under suitable assumptions on the priors, kriging gives the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) at unsampled locations.[1]  Interpolating methods based on other criteria such as smoothness (e.g., smoothing spline) may not yield the BLUP. The method is widely used in the domain of spatial analysis and computer experiments. The technique is also known as Wienerâ€“Kolmogorov prediction, after Norbert Wiener and Andrey Kolmogorov.","image":"Example_of_kriging_interpolation_in_1D.png.webp","url":"Kriging"}
