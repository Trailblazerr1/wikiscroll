{"title":"Durum","summary":"Durum wheat[2] (/ˈdjʊərəm/), also called pasta wheat[3] or macaroni wheat (Triticum durum or Triticum turgidum subsp. durum),[4] is a tetraploid species of wheat.[5] It is the second most cultivated species of wheat after common wheat, although it represents only 5% to 8% of global wheat production.[6] It was developed by artificial selection of the domesticated emmer wheat strains formerly grown in Central Europe and the Near East around 7000 BC, which developed a naked, free-threshing form.[7]  Like emmer, durum wheat is awned (with bristles). It is the predominant wheat that grows in the Middle East.","image":"Triticum_durum.jpg.webp","url":"Durum"}
