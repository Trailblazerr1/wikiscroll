{"title":"Chapel","summary":"A chapel is a Christian place of prayer and worship that is usually relatively small.  The term has several meanings. Firstly, smaller spaces inside a church that have their own altar are often called chapels; the Lady chapel is a common type of these.  Secondly, a chapel is a place of worship, sometimes non-denominational,[1] that is part of a building or complex with some other main purpose, such as a school, college, hospital, palace or large aristocratic house, castle, barracks, prison, funeral home, cemetery, airport, or a military or commercial ship.[2]  Thirdly, chapels are small places of worship, built as satellite sites by a church or monastery, for example in remote areas; these are often called a chapel of ease.  A feature of all these types is that often no clergy were permanently resident or specifically attached to the chapel.","image":"St_Paul's_Cathedral_Chapel_of_St_Michael_%26_St_George%2C_London_UK_-_Diliff.jpg.webp"}
