{"title":"List of highest-scoring NBA games","summary":"In basketball, points are used to keep track of the score in a game. Points can be accumulated by making field goals (worth two points from within the three-point line or three points from beyond the three-point line) or free throws (worth one point).[1] The team that records the most points at the end of a game is declared the game's winner. If the game is still tied at the end of regulation play, additional overtime period(s) are played in order to determine the winner.","image":"McNichols_Sports_Arena_1994.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_highest-scoring_NBA_games"}
