{"title":"Ralph Neville","summary":"Ralph Neville (or Ralf Nevill[1]  or Ralph de Neville;[2] died 1244) was a medieval clergyman and politician who served as Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor of England. Neville first appears in the historical record in 1207 in the service of King John, and remained in royal service throughout the rest of his life. By 1213 Neville had custody of the Great Seal of England, although he was not named chancellor, the office responsible for the seal, until 1226. He was rewarded with the bishopric of Chichester in 1222. Although he was also briefly Archbishop-elect of Canterbury and Bishop-elect of Winchester, both elections were set aside, or quashed, and he held neither office.","image":"High_altar_at_Chichester_Cathedral.JPG.webp","url":"Ralph_Neville"}
