{"title":"Computer literacy","summary":"Computer literacy is defined as the knowledge and ability to use computers and related technology efficiently, with skill levels ranging from elementary use to computer programming and advanced problem solving. Computer literacy can also refer to the comfort level someone has with using computer programs and applications. Another valuable component is understanding how computers work and operate. Computer literacy may be distinguished from computer programming, which primarily focuses on the design and coding of computer programs rather than the familiarity and skill in their use.[1] Various countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, have created initiatives to improve national computer literacy rates.","image":"When_technology_meets_Community.jpg.webp"}
