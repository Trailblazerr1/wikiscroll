{"title":"Ernst Mach","summary":"Ernst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach (/mɑːx/; German: [ˈɛɐ̯nst ˈmax]; 18 February 1838 – 19 February 1916) was an Austrian[7] (Moravian born) physicist and philosopher, noted for his contributions to physics such as the study of shock waves. The ratio of one's speed to that of sound is named the Mach number in his honour. As a philosopher of science, he was a major influence on logical positivism and American pragmatism.[8] Through his criticism of Newton's theories of space and time, he foreshadowed Einstein's theory of relativity.[9]","image":"Ernst_Mach_01.jpg.webp","url":"Ernst_Mach"}
