{"title":"Coelom","summary":"The coelom (or celom[1]) is the main body cavity in most animals[2] and is positioned inside the body to surround and contain the digestive tract and other organs. In some animals, it is lined with mesothelium. In other animals, such as molluscs, it remains undifferentiated. In the past, and for practical purposes, coelom characteristics have been used to classify bilaterian animal phyla into informal groups.","image":"Annelid_redone_w_white_background.svg.png.webp","url":"Coelom"}
