{"title":"Third-wave feminism","summary":"Third-wave feminism is an iteration of the feminist movement. It began in the United States[2] in the early 1990s and continued until the rise of the fourth wave in the 2010s.[3][4] Born in the 1960s and 1970s as members of Generation X and grounded in the civil-rights advances of the second wave, third-wave feminists embraced individualism in women and diversity and sought to redefine what it meant to be a feminist.[2][5][6] The third wave saw the emergence of new feminist currents and theories, such as intersectionality, sex positivity, vegetarian ecofeminism, transfeminism, and postmodern feminism. According to feminist scholar Elizabeth Evans, the \"confusion surrounding what constitutes third-wave feminism is in some respects its defining feature.\"[7]","image":"Symbol_venus.svg.png.webp","url":"Third-wave_feminism"}
