{"title":"Nymph","summary":"A nymph (Ancient Greek: νύμφη, romanized: nýmphē, Modern Greek: nímfi; Attic Greek: [nýmpʰɛː], Modern Greek: [ˈniɱfi]) in ancient Greek folklore is a minor female nature deity. Different from Greek goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as personifications of nature, are typically tied to a specific place or landform, and are usually depicted as beautiful maidens. They were not necessarily immortal, but lived much longer than humans.[1]","image":"Waterhouse_Hylas_and_the_Nymphs_Manchester_Art_Gallery_1896.15.jpg.webp"}
