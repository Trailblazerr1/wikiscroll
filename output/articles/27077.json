{"title":"Lithium chloride","summary":"Lithium chloride is a chemical compound with the formula LiCl. The salt is a typical ionic compound (with certain covalent characters) , although the small size of the Li+ ion gives rise to properties not seen for other alkali metal chlorides, such as extraordinary solubility in polar solvents (83.05 g/100 mL of water at 20 °C) and its hygroscopic properties.[5]","image":"Lithium-chloride-3D-ionic.png.webp","url":"Lithium_chloride"}
