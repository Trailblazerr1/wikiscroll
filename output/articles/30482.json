{"title":"Moon","summary":"The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia),[16] it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet,[lower-alpha 6] the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite planet under geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654Â g); Jupiter's moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.","image":"Moon_decrescent_symbol_(fixed_width).svg.png.webp","url":"Moon"}
