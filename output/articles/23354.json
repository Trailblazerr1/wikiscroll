{"title":"Jet stream","summary":"Jet streams are fast flowing, narrow, meandering, air currents in the atmospheres of some planets, including Earth.[1] On Earth, the main jet streams are located near the altitude of the tropopause and are westerly winds (flowing west to east). Jet streams may start, stop, split into two or more parts, combine into one stream, or flow in various directions including opposite to the direction of the remainder of the jet.","image":"Straalstroom.jpg.webp","url":"Jet_stream"}
