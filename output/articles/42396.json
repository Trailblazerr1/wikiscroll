{"title":"Stop Online Piracy Act","summary":"The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) was a controversial United States bill introduced on October 26, 2011, by U.S. Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to combat online copyright infringement and online trafficking in counterfeit goods. Provisions included the requesting of court orders to bar advertising networks and payment facilities from conducting business with infringing websites, and web search engines from linking to the websites, and court orders requiring Internet service providers to block access to the websites. The proposed law would have expanded existing criminal laws to include unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content, imposing a maximum penalty of five years in prison.","image":"Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg.png.webp"}
