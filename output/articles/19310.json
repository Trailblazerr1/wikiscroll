{"title":"HMS Repulse (1916)","summary":"HMS Repulse was one of two  Renown-class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. Originally laid down as an improved version of the  Revenge-class battleships, her construction was suspended on the outbreak of war because she would not be ready in time. Admiral Lord Fisher, upon becoming First Sea Lord, gained approval to resume construction as a battlecruiser that could be built and enter service quickly. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, quickly produced an entirely new design to meet Admiral Lord Fisher's requirements and the builders agreed to deliver the ship in 15 months. They did not quite meet that ambitious goal, but the ship was delivered a few months after the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Repulse and her sister ship Renown, were the world's fastest capital ships upon completion.","image":"Renown-7.jpg.webp"}
