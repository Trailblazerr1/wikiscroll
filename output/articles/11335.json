{"title":"Counterpoint","summary":"In music, counterpoint is the relationship between two or more musical lines (or voices) which are harmonically interdependent yet independent in rhythm and melodic contour.[1] It has been most commonly identified in the European classical tradition, strongly developing during the Renaissance and in much of the common practice period, especially in the Baroque. The term originates from the Latin punctus contra punctum meaning \"point against point\", i.e. \"note against note\".","image":"Bach_3-part_Invention_BWV_795%2C_bars_7-9.png.webp"}
