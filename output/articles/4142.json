{"title":"Apple II","summary":"The Apple II (stylized as apple ][) is an 8-bit home computer and one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products.[3] It was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak; Steve Jobs oversaw the development of Apple II's foam-molded plastic case[4] and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply.[5] It was introduced by Jobs and Wozniak at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, and marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer aimed at a consumer marketâ€”branded toward American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists.[6]","image":"Trinity77.jpg.webp","url":"Apple_II"}
