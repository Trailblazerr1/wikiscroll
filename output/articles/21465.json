{"title":"I Am that I Am","summary":"I am that I am is a common English translation of the Hebrew phrase אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה‎, ’ehye ’ăšer ’ehye ([ʔehˈje ʔaˈʃer ʔehˈje])– also \"I am who I am,\" \"I will become what I choose to become\", \"I am what I am,\" \"I will be what I will be,\" \"I create what(ever) I create,\" or \"I am the Existing One.\"[1] The traditional English translation within Judaism favors \"I will be what I will be\" because there is no present tense of the verb \"to be\" in the Hebrew language.","image":"EhyehAsherEhyeh1.jpg.webp","url":"I_Am_that_I_Am"}
