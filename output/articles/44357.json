{"title":"The Little Shop of Horrors","summary":"The Little Shop of Horrors is a 1960 American horror black comedy film directed by Roger Corman. Written by Charles B. Griffith, the film is a farce about an inadequate florist's assistant who cultivates a plant that feeds on human blood. The film's concept may have been inspired by \"Green Thoughts\", a 1932 story by John Collier about a man-eating plant.[6] Hollywood writer Dennis McDougal suggests that Griffith may have been influenced by Arthur C. Clarke's 1956 sci-fi short story \"The Reluctant Orchid\"[7] (which was in turn inspired by the 1905 H. G. Wells story \"The Flowering of the Strange Orchid\").","image":"LittleShop.jpg.webp"}
