{"title":"Ultrasound","summary":"Ultrasound is sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound is not different from \"normal\" (audible) sound in its physical properties, except that humans cannot hear it. This limit varies from person to person and is approximately 20 kilohertz (20,000 hertz) in healthy young adults. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20Â kHz up to several gigahertz.","image":"CRL_Crown_rump_length_12_weeks_ecografia_Dr._Wolfgang_Moroder.jpg.webp"}
