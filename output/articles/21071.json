{"title":"Humid continental climate","summary":"A humid continental climate  is a climatic region defined by Russo-German climatologist Wladimir Köppen in 1900,[1] typified by four distinct seasons and large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold in the northern areas) winters.  Precipitation is usually distributed throughout the year. The definition of this climate regarding temperature is as follows: the mean temperature of the coldest month must be below 0 °C (32.0 °F) or −3 °C (26.6 °F) [2] and there must be at least four months whose mean temperatures are at or above 10 °C (50 °F). In addition, the location in question must not be semi-arid or arid. The Dfb, Dwb, and Dsb subtypes are also known as hemiboreal.","image":"Koppen-Geiger_Map_D_present.svg.png.webp"}
