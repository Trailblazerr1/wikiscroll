{"title":"Plumage","summary":"Plumage (Latin: pluma \"feather\") is a layer of feathers that cover a bird and the pattern, colour, and arrangement of those feathers. The pattern and colours of plumage differ between species and subspecies and may vary with age classes. Within species, there can be different colour morphs. The placement of feathers on a bird is not haphazard, but rather emerge in organized, overlapping rows and groups, and these feather tracts are known by standardized names.[1][2]","image":"Plumage_house_sparrow.jpg.webp","url":"Plumage"}
