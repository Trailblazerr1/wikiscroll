{"title":"Celesta","summary":"The celesta /sɪˈlɛstə/ or celeste /sɪˈlɛst/, also called a bell-piano, is a struck idiophone operated by a keyboard. It looks similar to an upright piano (four- or five-octave), albeit with smaller keys and a much smaller cabinet, or a large wooden music box (three-octave). The keys connect to hammers that strike a graduated set of metal (usually steel) plates or bars suspended over wooden resonators. Four- or five-octave models usually have a damper pedal that sustains or damps the sound. The three-octave instruments do not have a pedal because of their small \"table-top\" design. One of the best-known works that uses the celesta is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from The Nutcracker.","image":"Celesta_Schiedmayer_Studio.jpg.webp"}
