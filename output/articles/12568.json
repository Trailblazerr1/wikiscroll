{"title":"Demographics of Alberta","summary":"Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years, due in large part to its economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province saw high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration when compared to other provinces.[1] Approximately 81% of the population live in urban areas and only about 19% live in rural areas. The Calgaryâ€“Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized area in Alberta and is one of Canada's four most urban regions.[2] Many of Alberta's cities and towns have also experienced high rates of growth in recent history. From a population of 73,022 in 1901, Alberta has grown to 3,645,257 in 2011 and in the process has gone from less than 1.5% of Canada's population to 10.9%.[3] As of July 1, 2018, Alberta's population represented 11.6% of Canada's total population of 37,058,856 making it the fourth most populated province in Canada.[4][Notes 1] According to the 2018 third quarter report, Alberta's population increased by 23,096 to 4,330,206, the largest increase since the 2014 economic downturn.[5][6]","image":"Canada_Alberta_Density_2016_CB.svg.png.webp","url":"Demographics_of_Alberta"}
