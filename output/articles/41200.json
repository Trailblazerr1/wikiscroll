It may also be viewed as the sodium salt of hypochlorous acid. The anhydrous compound is unstable and may decompose explosively.[2][3] It can be crystallized as a pentahydrate NaOCl·5H2O, a pale greenish-yellow solid which is not explosive and is stable if kept refrigerated.[4][5]","image":"NaOCl.svg.png.webp","url":"Sodium_hypochlorite"}
