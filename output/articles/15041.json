{"title":"Erg (landform)","summary":"An erg (also sand sea or dune sea, or sand sheet if it lacks dunes) is a broad, flat area of desert covered with wind-swept sand with little or no vegetative cover.[1] The word is derived from the Arabic word ʿarq (عرق), meaning \"dune field\".[2] Strictly speaking, an erg is defined as a desert area that contains more than 125 km2 (48 sq mi) of aeolian or wind-blown sand[3] and where sand covers more than 20% of the surface.[2] Smaller areas are known as \"dune fields\".[4] The largest hot desert in the world, the Sahara, covers 9 million square kilometres (3.5×10^6 sq mi) and contains several ergs, such as the Chech Erg and the Issaouane Erg in Algeria.[5] Approximately 85% of all the Earth's mobile sand is found in ergs that are greater than 32,000 km2 (12,355 sq mi).[6] Ergs are also found on other celestial bodies, such as Venus, Mars, and Saturn's moon Titan.","image":"IssaouaneErg_Algeria_ISS010-E-13539.jpg.webp","url":"Erg_(landform)"}
