{"title":"German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina","summary":"The German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (German: Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina â€“ Nationale Akademie der Wissenschaften), short Leopoldina, is the national academy of Germany, and is located in Halle (Saale). Founded on January 1, 1652, based on academic models in Italy, it was originally named the Academia Naturae Curiosorum until 1687 when Emperor Leopold I raised it to an academy and named it after himself.[1] It was since known under the German name Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina until 2007, when it was declared to be Germany's National Academy of Sciences.[1] The Leopoldina has a claim to be the oldest continuously existing learned society in the world. The validity of the claim depends in part on how certain definitional and historical questions are answered.[2][3]","image":"Academy_of_Sciences_Leopoldina.jpg.webp","url":"German_National_Academy_of_Sciences_Leopoldina"}
