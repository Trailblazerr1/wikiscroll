{"title":"1937 Fox vault fire","summary":"A major fire broke out in a 20th Century-Fox film-storage facility in Little Ferry, New Jersey, United States, on July 9, 1937. Flammable nitrate film had previously contributed to several fires in film-industry laboratories, studios, and vaults, although the precise causes were often unknown. In Little Ferry, gases produced by decaying film, combined with high temperatures and inadequate ventilation, resulted in spontaneous combustion.","image":"Little_Ferry_facility_after_fire.jpg.webp","url":"1937_Fox_vault_fire"}
