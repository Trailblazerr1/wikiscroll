{"title":"Nucleophilic substitution","summary":"A nucleophilic substitution is a class of chemical reactions in which an electron-rich chemical species (known as a nucleophile) replaces a functional group within another electron-deficient molecule (known as the electrophile). The molecule that contains the electrophile and the leaving functional group is called the substrate.[1][2]","image":"Sn2_Sn1_Graph_en.png.webp"}
