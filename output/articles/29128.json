{"title":"Mechanics","summary":"Mechanics (Greek: μηχανική) is the area of mathematics and physics concerned with the motions of physical objects, more specifically the relationships among force, matter, and motion.[1] Forces applied to objects result in displacements, or changes of an object's position relative to its environment. This branch of physics has its origins in Ancient Greece with the writings of Aristotle and Archimedes[2][3][4] (see History of classical mechanics and Timeline of classical mechanics). During the early modern period, scientists such as Galileo, Kepler, and Newton laid the foundation for what is now known as classical mechanics. It is a branch of classical physics that deals with particles that are either at rest or are moving with velocities significantly less than the speed of light. It can also be defined as a branch of science which deals with the motion of and forces on bodies not in the quantum realm.","image":"2c1d0f61f5c9b10e9cf7a208263f87f268ab92a1.svg","url":"Mechanics"}
