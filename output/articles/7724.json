{"title":"Brown dwarf","summary":"Brown dwarfs are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen (1H) into helium in their cores, unlike a main-sequence star. They have a mass between the most massive gas giant planets and the least massive stars, approximately 13 to 80 times that of Jupiter (MJ).[2][3] However, they are able to fuse deuterium (2H), and the most massive ones (> 65 MJ) are able to fuse lithium (7Li).[3]","image":"Artist’s_conception_of_a_brown_dwarf_like_2MASSJ22282889-431026.jpg.webp","url":"Brown_dwarf"}
