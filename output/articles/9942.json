{"title":"Chromosomal crossover","summary":"Chromosomal crossover, or crossing over, is the exchange of genetic material during sexual reproduction between two homologous chromosomes' non-sister chromatids that results in recombinant chromosomes. It is one of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the pachytene stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called synapsis. Synapsis begins before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophaseÂ I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome.","image":"Chromosomal_Crossover.svg.png.webp","url":"Chromosomal_crossover"}
