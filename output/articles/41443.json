{"title":"South-pointing chariot","summary":"The south-pointing chariot (or carriage) was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the south, no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, the pointer took the form of a doll or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was supposedly used as a compass for navigation and may also have had other purposes.","image":"South-pointing_chariot_(Science_Museum_model).jpg.webp"}
