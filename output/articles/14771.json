{"title":"Enantioselective synthesis","summary":"Enantioselective synthesis, also called asymmetric synthesis,[1] is a form of chemical synthesis. It is defined by IUPAC as: a chemical reaction (or reaction sequence) in which one or more new elements of chirality are formed in a substrate molecule and which produces the stereoisomeric (enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric) products in unequal amounts.[2]","image":"Sharpless_Dihydroxylation_Scheme.png.webp","url":"Enantioselective_synthesis"}
