{"title":"Wet market","summary":"A wet market (also called a public market[4] or a traditional market[5]) is a marketplace selling fresh meat, fish, produce, and other consumption-oriented perishable goods in a non-supermarket setting, as distinguished from \"dry markets\" that sell durable goods such as fabrics and electronics.[6][10] These include a wide variety of markets, such as farmers' markets, fish markets, and wildlife markets.[14] Not all wet markets sell live animals,[17] but the term wet market is sometimes used to signify a live animal market in which vendors slaughter animals upon customer purchase,[21] such as is done with poultry in Hong Kong.[22] Wet markets are common in many parts of the world,[26] notably in China, Southeast Asia, and South Asia. They often play critical roles in urban food security due to factors of pricing, freshness of food, social interaction, and local cultures.[27]","image":"WetmarketHK.jpg.webp","url":"Wet_market"}
