{"title":"Thermal energy","summary":"The term 'thermal energy' is used differently, and often loosely, in different contexts. It refers to several distinct physical concepts, such as the internal energy, or as the enthalpy, of a body of matter and radiation; or as heat, defined as a type of energy transfer (as is thermodynamic work); or as the characteristic energy of a degree of freedom, k B T {\\displaystyle k_{\\mathrm {B} }T} , in a system that is described in terms of its microscopic particulate constituents, where T {\\displaystyle T} denotes temperature and k B {\\displaystyle k_{\\mathrm {B} }} denotes the Boltzmann constant.","image":"8f94ae5846245c2ada025b27e9ce209d1299ccd5.svg","url":"Thermal_energy"}
