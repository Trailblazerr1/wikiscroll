{"title":"Thermal energy","summary":"The term 'thermal energy' is used differently, and often loosely, in different contexts. It refers to several distinct physical concepts, such as the internal energy, or as the enthalpy, of a body of matter and radiation; or as heat, defined as a type of energy transfer (as is thermodynamic work); or as the characteristic energy of a degree of freedom, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            \n              B\n            \n          \n        \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{\\mathrm {B} }T}\n  \n, in a system that is described in terms of its microscopic particulate constituents, where \n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n  \n denotes temperature and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          k\n          \n            \n              B\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k_{\\mathrm {B} }}\n  \n denotes the Boltzmann constant.","image":"8f94ae5846245c2ada025b27e9ce209d1299ccd5.svg"}
