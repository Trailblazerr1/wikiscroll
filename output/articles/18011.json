{"title":"Ghost Dance","summary":"The Ghost Dance (Caddo: Naniss√°anah,[1] also called the Ghost Dance of 1890) was a ceremony incorporated into numerous Native American belief systems. According to the teachings of the Northern Paiute spiritual leader Wovoka (renamed Jack Wilson), proper practice of the dance would reunite the living with spirits of the dead, bring the spirits to fight on their behalf, end American westward expansion, and bring peace, prosperity, and unity to Native American peoples throughout the region.[2]","image":"Ghost_Dance_at_Pine_Ridge.png.webp"}
