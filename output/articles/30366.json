{"title":"Mongolian script","summary":"The classical or traditional Mongolian script,[lower-alpha 1] also known as the Qudum Mongγol bičig,[lower-alpha 2] was the first writing system created specifically for the Mongolian language, and was the most widespread until the introduction of Cyrillic in 1946. It is traditionally written in vertical lines  Top-Down, right across the page. Derived from the Old Uyghur alphabet, Mongolian is a true alphabet, with separate letters for consonants and vowels. The Mongolian script has been adapted to write languages such as Oirat and Manchu. Alphabets based on this classical vertical script are used in Inner Mongolia and other parts of China to this day to write Mongolian, Xibe and experimentally, Evenki.","image":"Text_direction_TDright.svg.png.webp"}
