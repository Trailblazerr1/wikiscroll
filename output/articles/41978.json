{"title":"Standard language","summary":"A standard language (also standard variety, standard dialect, and standard) is a language variety that has undergone substantial codification of grammar and usage,[1][2] although occasionally the term refers to the entirety of a language that includes a standardized form as one of its varieties.[3][4] Typically, the language varieties that undergo substantive standardization are the dialects associated with centers of commerce and government.[5] By processes that linguistic anthropologists call \"referential displacement\"[6] and that sociolinguists call \"elaboration of function\",[7] these varieties acquire the social prestige associated with commerce and government. As a sociological effect of these processes, most users of this language come to believe that the standard language is inherently superior or consider it the linguistic baseline against which to judge other varieties of language.[8]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
