{"title":"Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)","summary":"Protease inhibitors (PIs) are medications that act by interfering with enzymes that cleave proteins. Some of the most well known are antiviral drugs widely used to treat HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C. These protease inhibitors prevent viral replication by selectively binding to viral proteases (e.g. HIV-1 protease) and blocking proteolytic cleavage of protein precursors that are necessary for the production of infectious viral particles.","image":"AIDS_diagnoses_and_deaths_in_the_U.S._1981â€“2008.svg.png.webp","url":"Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology)"}
