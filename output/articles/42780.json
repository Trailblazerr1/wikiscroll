{"title":"Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award","summary":"The Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, or Super Bowl MVP, is presented annually to the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, the National Football League's (NFL) championship game. The winner is chosen by a panel of 16 football writers and broadcasters, and, since Super Bowl XXXV in 2001, fans voting electronically. The media panel's ballots count for 80 percent of the vote tally, while the viewers' ballots make up the other 20 percent.[1][2] The game's viewing audience can vote on the Internet or by using cellular phones;[1] Media voters are asked to vote with about five minutes remaining in the game, but are allowed to change their mind when the game ends. They can nominate one player from each team, with instructions to count their vote for the player on the winning team.[3] Voters cannot select an entire unit.[4]","image":"Super_Bowl_MVP.png.webp","url":"Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award"}
