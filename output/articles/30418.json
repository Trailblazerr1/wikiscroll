{"title":"Monsignor","summary":"Monsignor (/mɒnˈsiːnjər/; Italian: monsignore [monsiɲˈɲoːre]) is an honorific form of address for some members of the clergy, usually of the Roman Catholic Church, including honorary prelates and canons. Unlike the rank of bishop or cardinal, and despite having distinctive garb and headgear, \"Monsignor\" is a form of address, not an appointment. Properly speaking, one cannot be \"made a monsignor\" or be \"the monsignor of a parish\". The title or form of address is associated with certain papal awards, which Pope Paul VI reduced to three classes: those of Protonotary Apostolic, Honorary Prelate, and Chaplain of His Holiness.","image":"Emblem_of_the_Papacy_SE.svg.png.webp"}
