{"title":"Karnak","summary":"The Karnak Temple Complex, commonly known as Karnak (/ˈkɑːr.næk/,[1] which was originally derived from Arabic: خورنق‎ Khurnaq \"fortified village\"[2]), comprises a vast mix of decayed temples, pylons, chapels, and other buildings near Luxor, Egypt. Construction at the complex began during the reign of Senusret I in the Middle Kingdom (around 2000–1700 BCE) and continued into the Ptolemaic Kingdom (305–30 BCE), although most of the extant buildings date from the New Kingdom. The area around Karnak was the ancient Egyptian Ipet-isut (\"The Most Selected of Places\") and the main place of worship of the 18th Dynastic Theban Triad, with the god Amun as its head. It is part of the monumental city of Thebes, and in 1979 it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the city.[3] The Karnak complex gives its name to the nearby, and partly surrounded, modern village of El-Karnak, 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) north of Luxor.","image":"Temple_de_Louxor_68.jpg.webp","url":"Karnak"}
