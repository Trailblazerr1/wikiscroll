{"title":"Silane","summary":"Silane is a molecule of one central silicon atom with four attachments. The attachments can be any combination of organic or inorganic groups. An example is silane tetrahydride an inorganic compound with chemical formula, SiH4, making it a group 14 hydride.  It is a colourless, pyrophoric, toxic gas with a sharp, repulsive smell, somewhat similar to that of acetic acid.[5] Silane is of practical interest as a precursor to elemental silicon. Silane with alkyl groups are effective water repellents for mineral surfaces such as concrete and masonry. Silanes with both organic and inorganic attachments are used as coupling agents.","image":"Silane-2D.png.webp","url":"Silane"}
