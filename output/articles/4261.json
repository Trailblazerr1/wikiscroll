{"title":"Archaeoindris","summary":"Archaeoindris fontoynontii is an extinct giant lemur and the largest primate known to have evolved on Madagascar, comparable in size to a male gorilla.  It belonged to a family of extinct lemurs known as \"sloth lemurs\" (Palaeopropithecidae), and because of its extremely large size, it has been compared to the ground sloths that once roamed North and South America.  It was most closely related to Palaeopropithecus, the second largest type of sloth lemur.  Along with the other sloth lemurs, Archaeoindris was related to the living indri, sifakas, and woolly lemurs, as well as the recently extinct monkey lemurs (Archaeolemuridae).  The genus, Archaeoindris, translates to \"ancient indri-like lemur\", even though it probably became extinct recently, around 350 BCE.","image":"Archaeoindris_fontoynonti_667.JPG.webp","url":"Archaeoindris"}
