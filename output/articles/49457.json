{"title":"Zeroth law of thermodynamics","summary":"The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.[1][2][3] Accordingly, thermal equilibrium between systems is a transitive relation.","image":"Carnot_heat_engine_2.svg.png.webp","url":"Zeroth_law_of_thermodynamics"}
