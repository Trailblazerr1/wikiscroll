{"title":"Rust Never Sleeps","summary":"Rust Never Sleeps is an album with both studio and live tracks by Canadian American singer-songwriter Neil Young and American band Crazy Horse. It was released on June 22, 1979, by Reprise Records.[5] Most of the album was recorded live, then overdubbed in the studio, while others originated in the studio. Young used the phrase \"rust never sleeps\" as a concept for his tour with Crazy Horse to avoid artistic complacency and try more progressive, theatrical approaches to performing live.[6]","image":"Neil_Young_Rust_Never_Sleeps.jpg.webp","url":"Rust_Never_Sleeps"}
