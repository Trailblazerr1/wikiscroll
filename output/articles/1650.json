{"title":"x86","summary":"x86 is a family of instruction set architectures[lower-alpha 1] initially developed by Intel based on the Intel 8086 microprocessor and its 8088 variant. The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of Intel's 8-bit 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address. The term \"x86\" came into being because the names of several successors to Intel's 8086 processor end in \"86\", including the 80186, 80286, 80386 and 80486 processors.","image":"KL_Intel_D8086.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fX86"}
