{"title":"Cardinal-nephew","summary":"A cardinal-nephew (Latin: cardinalis nepos;[1] Italian: cardinale nipote;[2] Spanish: valido de su tío; Portuguese: cardeal-sobrinho; French: prince de fortune)[3] was a cardinal elevated by a pope who was that cardinal's relative. The practice of creating cardinal-nephews originated in the Middle Ages, and reached its apex during the 16th and 17th centuries. The last cardinal-nephew was named in 1689 and the practice was abolished in 1692.[4] The word nepotism originally referred specifically to this practice, when it appeared in the English language about 1669.[5] From the middle of the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) until Pope Innocent XII's anti-nepotism bull (a papal charter), Romanum decet pontificem (1692), a pope without a cardinal-nephew was the exception to the rule.[6] Every Renaissance pope who created cardinals appointed a relative to the College of Cardinals, and the nephew was the most common choice,[7] although one of Alexander VI's creations was his own son.","image":"Pietro_Ottoboni_by_Francesco_Trevisani.jpg.webp","url":"Cardinal-nephew"}
