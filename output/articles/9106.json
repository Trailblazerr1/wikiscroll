{"title":"Centre-left politics","summary":"Centre-left politics (British English) or center-left politics (American English), also referred to as moderate-left politics, are political views that lean to the left-wing on the leftâ€“right political spectrum, but closer to the centre than other left-wing politics. Those on the centre-left believe in working within the established systems to improve social justice.[1] The centre-left promotes a degree of social equality that it believes is achievable through promoting equal opportunity.[2] The centre-left emphasizes that the achievement of equality requires personal responsibility in areas in control by the individual person through their abilities and talents as well as social responsibility in areas outside control by the person in their abilities or talents.[3]","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp","url":"Centre-left_politics"}
