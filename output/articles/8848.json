{"title":"Castorocauda","summary":"Castorocauda is an extinct, semi-aquatic, superficially beaver-like genus of docodont mammaliaforms with one species, C. lutrasimilis. It is part of the Yanliao Biota, found in the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia, China dating to the Middle to Late Jurassic. It was part of an explosive Middle Jurassic radiation of Mammaliaformes moving into diverse habitats and niches. Its discovery in 2006, along with the discovery of other unusual mammaliaforms, disproves the previous hypothesis of Mammaliaformes remaining evolutionarily stagnant until the extinction of the dinosaurs.","image":"Castorocauda_BW.jpg.webp","url":"Castorocauda"}
