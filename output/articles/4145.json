{"title":"Apple Lisa","summary":"Lisa is a desktop computer developed by Apple, released on January 19, 1983. It is one of the first personal computers to present a graphical user interface (GUI) in a machine aimed at individual business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978,[2] and it underwent many changes during the development period before shipping at US$9,995 (equivalent to $25,970 in 2020) with a five-megabyte hard drive. Lisa was affected by its high price, insufficient software, unreliable Apple FileWare floppy disks, and the immediate release of the cheaper and faster Macintosh. Only 10,000 Lisas were sold in two years.","image":"Apple_Lisa.jpg.webp"}
