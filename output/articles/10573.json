{"title":"Colour revolution","summary":"Worldwide media use the term colour revolution (sometimes coloured revolution)[1] to describe various protest movements and accompanying attempted or successful change of governments that took place in several countries of the  former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia and People's Republic of China during the early 21st century. The term has also been more widely applied to several other revolutions elsewhere, including in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region and South America, dating from the late 1980s to the 2020s. Some observers (such as Justin Raimondo and Michael Lind) have called the events a revolutionary wave, the origins of which can be traced back to the 1986 People Power Revolution (also known as the \"Yellow Revolution\") in the Philippines.","image":"Color_Revolutions_Map.png.webp","url":"Colour_revolution"}
