{"title":"Diver communications","summary":"Diver communications are the methods used by divers to communicate with each other or with surface members of the dive team. In professional diving, communication is usually between a single working diver and the diving supervisor at the surface control point. This is considered important both for managing the diving work, and as a safety measure for monitoring the condition of the diver. The traditional method of communication was by line signals, but this has been superseded by voice communication, and line signals are now used in emergencies when voice communications have failed. Surface supplied divers often carry a closed circuit video camera on the helmet which allows the surface team to see what the diver is doing and to be involved in inspection tasks. This can also be used to transmit hand signals to the surface if voice communications fails.[1] Underwater slates may be used to write text messages which can be shown to other divers,[2][3] and there are some dive computers which allow a limited number of pre-programmed text messages to be sent through-water to other divers or surface personnel with compatible equipment.[4]","image":"US_Navy_100504-N-9818V-453_Master_Chief_Petty_Officer_of_the_Navy_(MCPON)_Rick_West_and_divers_from_Southwest_Regional_Maintenance_Center_conduct_pre-dive_checks%3B_hand_signal_\"OK\".jpg.webp"}
