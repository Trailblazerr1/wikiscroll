{"title":"D端rer's Rhinoceros","summary":"D端rer's Rhinoceros is the name commonly given to a woodcut executed by German painter and printmaker Albrecht D端rer in 1515.[1] The image is based on a written description and brief sketch by an unknown artist of an Indian rhinoceros that had arrived in Lisbon in 1515.[2] D端rer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since Roman times.[2] In late 1515, the King of Portugal, Manuel I, sent the animal as a gift for Pope Leo X, but it died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early 1516. A live rhinoceros was not seen again in Europe until a second specimen, named Abada, arrived from India at the court of Sebastian of Portugal in 1577, being later inherited by Philip II of Spain around 1580.[3][4]","image":"The_Rhinoceros_(NGA_1964.8.697)_enhanced.png.webp"}
