{"title":"The Serpentine","summary":"The Serpentine (also known as the Serpentine River) is a 40-acre (16Â ha) recreational lake in Hyde Park, London, England, created in 1730 at the behest of Queen Caroline. Although it is common to refer to the entire body of water as the Serpentine, strictly the name refers only to the eastern half of the lake. Serpentine Bridge, which marks the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, also marks the Serpentine's western boundary; the long and narrow western half of the lake is known as the Long Water. The Serpentine takes its name from its snakelike, curving shape,[1] although it only has one bend.","image":"Serpentine_Bridge_along_Long_Water.jpg.webp","url":"The_Serpentine"}
