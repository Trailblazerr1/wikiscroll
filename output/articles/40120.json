{"title":"Serpin","summary":"Serpins are a superfamily of proteins with similar structures that were first identified for their protease inhibition activity and are found in all kingdoms of life.[1] The acronym serpin was originally coined because the first serpins to be identified act on chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors).[2][3] They are notable for their unusual mechanism of action, in which they irreversibly inhibit their target protease by undergoing a large conformational change to disrupt its active site.[4][5] This contrasts with the more common competitive mechanism for protease inhibitors that bind to and block access to the protease active site.[5][6]","image":"Serpin_(stressed).png.webp","url":"Serpin"}
