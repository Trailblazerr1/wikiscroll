{"title":"David","summary":"David (/ˈdeɪvɪd/; Hebrew: דָּוִד‎, Modern: Davīd, Tiberian: Dāwīḏ)[lower-alpha 2] is described in the Hebrew Bible as a king of the United Monarchy of Israel and Judah.[6][7] In the Books of Samuel, David is a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the giant Goliath, a champion of the Philistines in southern Canaan. David becomes a favourite of the first king of united Israel, Saul, and forges a close friendship with Jonathan, a son of Saul. Out of suspicion that David is seeking to usurp the throne, Saul attempts to kill David, forcing the latter to go into hiding and operate as a fugitive for several years. After Saul and Jonathan are both killed in battle against the Philistines, a 30-year-old David is anointed king over all of Israel and Judah, following which he conquers the city of Jerusalem, establishes it as Israel's capital, and takes the Ark of the Covenant into the city to be the centre-point of worship in the Israelite religion.","image":"King_David%2C_the_King_of_Israel.jpg.webp","url":"A%2fDavid"}
