{"title":"Glitter (soundtrack)","summary":"Glitter is the soundtrack to the 2001 film of the same title and the eighth studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey, released on August 18, 2001, in Japan by Sony Music[1] and worldwide on September 11, 2001, by Virgin Records. It was a complete musical departure from any of Carey's previous releases, focusing heavily on recreating a 1980s post-disco era to accompany the film, set in 1983. By covering or heavily sampling several older tunes and songs, Carey created Glitter as an album that would help viewers connect with the film, as well as incorporating newly written ballads. The singer collaborated with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and DJ Clue, who co-produced the album.","image":"Glitter_Mariah_Carey.png.webp","url":"Glitter_(soundtrack)"}
