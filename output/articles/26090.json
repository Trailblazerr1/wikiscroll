{"title":"Lichen planus","summary":"Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic inflammatory and immune-mediated disease that affects the skin, nails, hair, and mucous membranes.[1] It is not an actual lichen, and is only named that because it looks like one.[2] It is characterized by polygonal, flat-topped, violaceous papules and plaques with overlying, reticulated, fine white scale (Wickham's striae), commonly affecting dorsal hands, flexural wrists and forearms, trunk, anterior lower legs and oral mucosa.[3] Although there is a broad clinical range of LP manifestations, the skin and oral cavity remain as the major sites of involvement.[4] The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be the result of an autoimmune process with an unknown initial trigger. There is no cure, but many different medications and procedures have been used in efforts to control the symptoms.","image":"Lichen_Planus_(2).JPG.webp"}
