{"title":"Event (probability theory)","summary":"In probability theory, an event is a set of outcomes of an experiment (a subset of the sample space) to which a probability is assigned.[1] A single outcome may be an element of many different events,[2] and different events in an experiment are usually not equally likely, since they may include very different groups of outcomes.[3] An event consisting of only a single outcome is called an elementary event or an atomic event; that is, it is a singleton set. An event \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n is said to occur if \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n contains the outcome \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n of the experiment (or trial) (that is, if \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ∈\n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\in S}\n  \n). The probability (with respect to some probability measure) that an event \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n occurs is the probability that \n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n  \n contains the outcome \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x}\n  \n of an experiment (that is, it is the probability that \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        ∈\n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x\\in S}\n  \n). \nAn event defines a complementary event, namely the complementary set (the event not occurring), and together these define a Bernoulli trial: did the event occur or not?","image":"4611d85173cd3b508e67077d4a1252c9c05abca2.svg"}
