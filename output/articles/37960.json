{"title":"Rifampicin","summary":"Rifampicin, also known as rifampin, is an antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium avium complex, leprosy, and Legionnairesâ€™ disease.[2] It is almost always used together with other antibiotics with two notable exceptions: when given as a \"preferred treatment that is strongly recommended\"[3] for latent TB infection; and when used as post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b and meningococcal disease in people who have been exposed to those bacteria.[2] Before treating a person for a long period of time, measurements of liver enzymes and blood counts are recommended.[2] Rifampicin may be given either by mouth or intravenously.[2]","image":"Rifampicin_structure.svg.png.webp"}
