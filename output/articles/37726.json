{"title":"Restless legs syndrome","summary":"Restless legs syndrome (RLS), now known as Willis-Ekbom Disease (WED), is generally a long-term disorder that causes a strong urge to move one's legs.[2][7] There is often an unpleasant feeling in the legs that improves somewhat by moving them.[2] This is often described as aching, tingling, or crawling in nature.[2] Occasionally, arms may also be affected.[2] The feelings generally happen when at rest and therefore can make it hard to sleep.[2] Due to the disturbance in sleep, people with RLS may have daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability and a depressed mood.[2] Additionally, many have limb twitching during sleep.[8] RLS is not the same as habitual foot tapping or leg rocking.[9]","image":"RLS_sleep_patterns_diagram_-_en.svg.png.webp","url":"Restless_legs_syndrome"}
