It is the first published and best known of seven novels in The Chronicles of Narnia (1950â€“1956). Among all the author's books, it is also the most widely held in libraries.[2] Although it was originally the first of The Chronicles of Narnia, it is volume two in recent editions that are sequenced by the stories' chronology. Like the other Chronicles, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many later editions.[1][3]","image":"TheLionWitchWardrobe(1stEd).jpg.webp","url":"The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe"}
