{"title":"Brainwashing","summary":"Brainwashing (also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion,  thought control, thought reform, and re-education) is the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques. Brainwashing is said to reduce its subjects' ability to think critically or independently, to allow the introduction of new, unwanted thoughts and ideas into their minds,[1] as well as to change their attitudes, values and beliefs.[2][3]","image":"Brainwashing_1%2C_acr√≠lico_sobre_lienzo%2C_100_x_80_cms.JPG.webp"}
