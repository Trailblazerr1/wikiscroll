{"title":"Blind Faith","summary":"Blind Faith were an English supergroup featuring Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. They were eagerly anticipated by the music press following on the success of each of the member's former bands, including Clapton and Baker's former group Cream and Winwood's former group Traffic, but they split after only a few months, producing only one album and a three-month long summer tour.","image":"Blind_Faith_(1969).jpg.webp","url":"Blind_Faith"}
