{"title":"Extinction event","summary":"An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation. The number of major mass extinctions in the last 440 million years are estimated from as few as five to more than twenty. These differences stem from disagreement as to what constitutes an extinction event as \"major\", and the data chosen to measure past diversity.","image":"Extinction_intensity.svg.png.webp","url":"Extinction_event"}
