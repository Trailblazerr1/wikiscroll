{"title":"History of American newspapers","summary":"The history of American newspapers begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first  colonial newspapers.  American newspapers began as modest affairsâ€”a sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first amendment to U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press.  The U.S. Postal Service Act of 1792 provided substantial subsidies:  Newspapers were delivered up to 100 miles for a penny and beyond for 1.5 cents, when first class postage ranged from six cents to a quarter.","image":"Representative_journals_of_the_United_States_1885.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_American_newspapers"}
