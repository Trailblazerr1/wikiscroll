{"title":"Eleatics","summary":"The Eleatics were a pre-Socratic school of philosophy founded by Parmenides in the early fifth centuryÂ BC in the ancient town of Elea. Other members of the school included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Xenophanes is sometimes included in the list, though there is some dispute over this.[1] Elea, whose modern-day appellation is Velia, was a Greek colony located in present-day Campania in southern Italy.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Eleatics"}
