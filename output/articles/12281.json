{"title":"Dawn (spacecraft)","summary":"Dawn is a retired space probe that was launched by NASA in September 2007 with the mission of studying two of the three known protoplanets of the asteroid belt: Vesta and Ceres.[1] In the fulfillment of that mission—the ninth in NASA's Discovery Program—Dawn entered orbit around Vesta on July 16, 2011, and completed a 14-month survey mission before leaving for Ceres in late 2012.[8][9] It entered orbit around Ceres on March 6, 2015.[10][11] In 2017, NASA announced that the planned nine-year mission would be extended until the probe's hydrazine fuel supply was depleted.[12] On November 1, 2018, NASA announced that Dawn had depleted its hydrazine, and the mission was ended. The spacecraft is currently in a derelict, but stable, orbit around Ceres.[13]","image":"Dawn_spacecraft_model.png.webp","url":"Dawn_(spacecraft)"}
