{"title":"Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut","summary":"The Temple of Hatshepsut (Egyptian: Ḏsr-ḏsrw meaning \"Holy of Holies\") is a mortuary temple built during the reign of Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.[lower-alpha 2] Located opposite the city of Luxor, it is considered to be a masterpiece of ancient architecture.[lower-alpha 3] Its three massive terraces rise above the desert floor and into the cliffs of Deir el-Bahari. The temple's twin functions are identified by its axes: on its main east-west axis, the temple served to receive the barque of Amun-Re at the climax of the Beautiful Festival of the Valley, while on its north-south axis it represented the life cycle of the pharaoh from coronation to rebirth. At the edge of the desert, 1 km (0.62 mi) east, connected by a causeway lies the accompanying valley temple. Across the river Nile, the whole structure points towards the monumental Eighth Pylon, Hatshepsut's most recognizable addition to the Temple of Karnak.","image":"hiero_D45.png.webp","url":"Mortuary_Temple_of_Hatshepsut"}
