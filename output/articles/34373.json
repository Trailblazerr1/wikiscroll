{"title":"Penny (British decimal coin)","summary":"The British decimal one penny (1p) coin is a unit of currency equalling one-hundredth of a pound sterling. Its obverse has featured the profile of Queen Elizabeth II since the coin's introduction on 15 February 1971, the day British currency was decimalised. Four different portraits of the Queen have been used on the obverse; the latest design by Jody Clark was introduced in 2015. The second and current reverse, designed by Matthew Dent, features a segment of the Royal Shield and was introduced in 2008.[1] The penny is the lowest value coin (in real terms) ever to circulate in the United Kingdom.","image":"British_one_penny_coin_2016_obverse.png.webp"}
