{"title":"Born rule","summary":"The Born rule (also called Born's rule) is a key postulate of quantum mechanics which gives the probability that a measurement of a quantum system will yield a given result.[1] In its simplest form, it states that the probability density of finding a particle at a given point, when measured, is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the particle's wavefunction at that point. It was formulated by German physicist Max Born in 1926.","image":"0de8741a7d26ae98689c7b3339e97dfafea9fd26.svg"}
