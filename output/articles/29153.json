{"title":"Medicaid","summary":"Medicaid in the United States is a federal and state program that helps with healthcare costs for some people with limited income and resources. Medicaid also offers benefits not normally covered by Medicare, including nursing home care and personal care services. The main difference between the two programs is that Medicaid covers healthcare costs for people with low incomes while Medicare provides health coverage for the elderly. There are also dual health plans for people who have both Medicaid and Medicare.[1] The Health Insurance Association of America describes Medicaid as \"a government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are insufficient to pay for health care.\"[2]","image":"Centers_for_Medicare_and_Medicaid_Services_logo.svg.png.webp"}
