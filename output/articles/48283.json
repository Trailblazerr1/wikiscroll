{"title":"Western Wall","summary":"The Wailing Wall (as it is known in the West) or Western Wall (derived from Hebrew: הַכּוֹתֶל הַמַּעֲרָבִי‎, romanized: HaKotel HaMa'aravi, lit. 'the western wall',[1] often shortened to the Kotel or Kosel), known in Islam as the Buraq Wall (Arabic: Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq حَائِط ٱلْبُرَاق Arabic pronunciation: ['ħaːʔɪtˤ albʊ'raːq]),[2] is an ancient limestone wall in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".[3] The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the Second Jewish Temple begun by Herod the Great,[4] which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the Temple Mount, in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshipers and visitors.","image":"Westernwall2.jpg.webp"}
