{"title":"Parsis","summary":"Parsis (/ˈpɑːrsiː/) or Parsees (lit. 'Persian' in the Persian language) are an ethnoreligious group of the Indian subcontinent whose religion is Zoroastrianism. Their ancestors migrated to the region from modern-day Iran following the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century CE. They are the first of two such to have done so, with the other being Iranis, who migrated to the subcontinent many centuries after the coming to power of the Qajar dynasty in Persia. According to a Zoroastrian epic, Qissa-i Sanjan, Parsis continued to migrate from the collapsed Sassanid Empire to Gujarat in between the 8th and 10th centuries CE, where they were given refuge to escape religious persecution during the early Muslim conquests.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11]","image":"Parsi_lady.jpg.webp"}
