{"title":"Paella","summary":"Paella (/paɪˈɛlə/ py-EL-ə,[1] Valencian: [paˈeʎa], Spanish: [paˈeʎa]) is a rice dish originally from Valencia. While it is commonly viewed by non-Spaniards as Spain's national dish, Spaniards almost unanimously consider it to be a dish from the Valencian region. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.[2][3] It is one of the best-known dishes in Spanish cuisine.","image":"01_Paella_Valenciana_original.jpg.webp"}
