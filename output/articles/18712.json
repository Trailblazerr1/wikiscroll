{"title":"Graphics card","summary":"A graphics card (also called a video card, display card, graphics adapter, video adapter, or display adapter) is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display device (such as a computer monitor). Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics. At the core of both is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is the main part that does the actual computations, but should not be confused with the graphics card as a whole, although \"GPU\" is often used as a metonymic shorthand to refer to graphics cards.","image":"RTX_3090_Founders_Edition!.jpg.webp","url":"Graphics_card"}
