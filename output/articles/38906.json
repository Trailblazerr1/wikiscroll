{"title":"SNARE (protein)","summary":"SNARE proteins – \"SNAP REceptor\" – are a large protein family consisting of at least 24 members in yeasts, more than 60 members in mammalian cells,[2][3] and some numbers in plants.[4] The primary role of SNARE proteins is to mediate vesicle fusion – the fusion of vesicles with the target membrane; this notably mediates exocytosis, but can also mediate the fusion of vesicles with membrane-bound compartments (such as a lysosome). The best studied SNAREs are those that mediate the neurotransmitter release of synaptic vesicles in neurons. These neuronal SNAREs are the targets of the neurotoxins responsible for botulism and tetanus produced by certain bacteria.","image":"Exocytosis-machinery.jpg.webp"}
