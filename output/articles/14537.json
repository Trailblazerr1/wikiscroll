{"title":"Elijah","summary":"Elijah  (/ɪˈlaɪdʒə/ ih-LY-jə; Hebrew: אֵלִיָּהוּ‎, ʾĒlīyyāhū, meaning \"My God is Yahweh[8]/YHWH\"[9][10]) or Greek form Elias (/ɪˈlaɪəs/ ih-LY-əs)[lower-alpha 1] was, according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible, a prophet and a miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel[11] during the reign of King Ahab (9th century BCE). In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Hebrew God over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection, bringing fire down from the sky, and entering heaven alive \"by fire\".[12] He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\".[13] Following his ascension, Elisha, his disciple and most devoted assistant, took over his role as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah's return \"before the coming of the great and terrible day of the LORD\",[14] making him a harbinger of the  Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Sirach, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and Baháʼí writings.","image":"Andrea_di_Bonaiuto_-_Madonna_and_Child_with_Saints_(detail)_-_WGA00311.jpg.webp"}
