{"title":"History of slavery in the Muslim world","summary":"The history of slavery in the Muslim world began with institutions inherited from pre-Islamic Arabia;[1] and the practice of keeping slaves subsequently developed in radically different ways, depending on social-political factors such as the Arab slave trade. Any non-Muslim could be enslaved.[2] Throughout Islamic history, slaves served in various social and economic roles, from powerful emirs to harshly treated manual laborers. Early on in Muslim history slaves provided plantation labor similar to that in the early-modern Americas, but this practice was abandoned after harsh treatment led to destructive slave revolts,[3] the most notable being the Zanj Rebellion of 869â€“883.[4] Slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, and animal husbandry, but most commonly as soldiers, guards, domestic workers,[3] and concubines. Many rulers relied on military slaves (often in huge standing armies) and on slaves in administration - to such a degree that the slaves could sometimes seize power. Among black slaves, there were roughly two females to every one male.[3] Two rough estimates by scholars of the numbers of just one group - black slaves held over twelve centuries in the Muslim world - are 11.5 million[5]\nand 14 million,[6][7]\nwhile other estimates indicate a number between 12 and 15 million African slaves prior to the 20th century.[8]","image":"IJzeren_voetring_voor_gevangenen_transparent_background.png.webp"}
