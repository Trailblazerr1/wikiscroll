{"title":"Foot binding","summary":"Foot binding, or footbinding, was the Chinese custom of breaking and tightly binding the feet of young girls in order to change their shape and size. Feet altered by footbinding were known as lotus feet, and the shoes made for these feet were known as lotus shoes. In late imperial China, bound feet were considered a status symbol and a mark of feminine beauty. However, footbinding was a painful practice that limited the mobility of women and resulted in lifelong disabilities.","image":"A_Chinese_Golden_Lily_Foot%2C_Lai_Afong%2C_c1870s.jpg.webp","url":"Foot_binding"}
