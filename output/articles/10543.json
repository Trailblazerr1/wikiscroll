{"title":"Colony","summary":"In political science, a colony is a territory subject to a form of foreign rule.[1] Though dominated by the foreign colonizers, colonies remain separate from the administration of the original country of the colonizers, the metropolitan state (or \"mother country\"). This administrative colonial separation makes colonies neither incorporated territories, nor client states. Some colonies have been organized either as dependent territories that are not sufficiently self-governed, or as self-governed colonies controlled by colonial settlers.","image":"Non-Self-Governing.png.webp","url":"Colony"}
