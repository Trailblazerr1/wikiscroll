{"title":"Girl group","summary":"A girl group is a music act featuring several female singers who generally harmonize together. The term \"girl group\" is also used in a narrower sense in the United States to denote the wave of American female pop music singing groups, many of whom were influenced by doo-wop and which flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s between the decline of early rock and roll and start of the British Invasion.[1][2] All-female bands, in which members also play instruments, are usually considered a separate phenomenon. These groups are sometimes called \"girl bands\" to differentiate,[3] although this terminology is not universally followed.","image":"Please_Mr._Postman_album.JPG.webp","url":"Girl_group"}
