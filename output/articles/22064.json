{"title":"Instructional design","summary":"Instructional design (ID), also known as instructional systems design (ISD), is the practice of systematically designing, developing and delivering instructional materials and experiences, both digital and physical, in a consistent and reliable fashion toward an efficient, effective, appealing, engaging and inspiring acquisition of knowledge.[1][2] The process consists broadly of determining the state and needs of the learner, defining the end goal of instruction, and creating some \"intervention\" to assist in the transition. The outcome of this instruction may be directly observable and scientifically measured or completely hidden and assumed.[3] There are many instructional design models but many are based on the ADDIE model with the five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation.","image":"Bloom_taxonomy.svg.png.webp","url":"Instructional_design"}
