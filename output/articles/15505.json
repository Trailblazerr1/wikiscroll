{"title":"Existentialism","summary":"Existentialism\n(/ˌɛɡzɪˈstɛnʃəlɪzəm/[1] /ˌɛksəˈstɛntʃəˌlɪzəm/[2]) is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the problem of human existence and centers on the experience of thinking, feeling, and acting.[3][4] In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point has been called \"the existential angst\", a sense of dread, disorientation, confusion, or anxiety in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.[5] Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.[6]","image":"Kierkegaard-Dostoyevsky-Nietzsche-Sartre.jpg.webp"}
