{"title":"Bamar people","summary":"The Bamar or Burman (Burmese: ဗမာလူမျိုး; MLCTS: ba. ma lu myui:, IPA: [bəmà lùmjó]; also historically Mranmas) are a Southeast Asian Sino-Tibetan ethnic group native to Myanmar (formerly Burma). The Bamar live primarily in the Irrawaddy River basin and speak the Burmese language, which is the sole official language of Myanmar at a national level.[1] Bamar customs and identity are closely intertwined with the broader Burmese culture. The country’s name changed from “Burma” to “Myanmar” in June of 1989 by the State Law and Order Restoration Council.[2]","image":"Myat_Phaya_Galay_and_Ko_Ko_Naing.jpg.webp"}
