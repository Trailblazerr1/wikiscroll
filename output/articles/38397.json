{"title":"Roman economy","summary":"The Roman economy during the Roman Republic, was largely agrarian and centered on the trading of commodities such as grain and wine.[2] Financial markets were established through such trade, and financial institutions, which extended credit for personal use and public infrastructure, were established primarily by interfamily wealth.[3] In times of agricultural and cash shortfall, Roman officials and moneyers tended to respond by coining money, which happened during the prolonged crisis of the First Punic War and created economic distortion and difficulties.","image":"GDP_regional_Ancient_Rome.png.webp"}
