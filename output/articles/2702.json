{"title":"Alcathoe bat","summary":"The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in the genus Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary when it was first described in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), other analyses do not support a close relationship between M.Â alcathoe and any other species.","image":"Myotis_alcathoe_-_Manuel_Ruedi_-_1_-_cropped.JPG.webp","url":"Alcathoe_bat"}
