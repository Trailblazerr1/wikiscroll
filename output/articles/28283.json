{"title":"Manhattan (cocktail)","summary":"A Manhattan is a cocktail made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. While rye is the traditional whiskey of choice, other commonly used whiskies include Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey. The cocktail is usually stirred then strained into a cocktail glass and garnished traditionally with a maraschino cherry.[1][2] A Manhattan may also be served on the rocks in a lowball glass.","image":"Manhattan_Cocktail2.jpg.webp","url":"Manhattan_(cocktail)"}
