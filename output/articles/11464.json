{"title":"Creole peoples","summary":"Creole people are ethnic groups which originated during the colonial era from racial mixing mainly involving West Africans as well as some other people born in colonies, such as French, Spanish, and Indigenous American peoples; this process is known as creolization. Creole peoples vary widely in ethnic background and mixture and many have since developed distinct ethnic identities. The development of creole languages is sometimes mistakenly attributed to the emergence of creole ethnic identities; however, the two developments occur independently.","image":"Jacques_Aman_Creole_in_a_Red_Turban.jpeg.webp","url":"Creole_peoples"}
