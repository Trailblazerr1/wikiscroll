{"title":"Scotch-Irish Americans","summary":"Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) Americans are American descendants of Ulster Protestants who immigrated from Ulster in northern Ireland to America during the 18th and 19th centuries, whose ancestors had originally migrated mainly from the Scottish Lowlands and Northern England (and sometimes from the Anglo-Scottish border).[5][6] In the 2017 American Community Survey, 5.39 million (1.7% of the population) reported Scottish ancestry, an additional 3 million (0.9% of the population) identified more specifically with Scotch-Irish ancestry, and many people who claim \"American ancestry\" may actually be of Scotch-Irish ancestry.[7][8][9]","image":"Scotch_vs._Scottish.jpg.webp","url":"Scotch-Irish_Americans"}
