{"title":"Neutron","summary":"The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol n or n0, which has a neutral (not positive or negative) charge, and a mass slightly greater than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons constitute the nuclei of atoms. Since protons and neutrons behave similarly within the nucleus, and each has a mass of approximately one atomic mass unit, they are both referred to as nucleons.[7] Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics.","image":"Neutron_quark_structure.svg.png.webp"}
