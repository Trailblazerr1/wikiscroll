{"title":"Debit card","summary":"A debit card  (also known as a bank card, plastic card or check card) is a payment card that can be used in place of cash to make purchases. It is similar to a credit card, but unlike a credit card, the money for the purchase must be in the cardholder's bank account at the time of a purchase and is immediately transferred directly from that account to the merchantâ€™s account to pay for the purchase.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
