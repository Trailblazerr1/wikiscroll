{"title":"Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)","summary":"Butterfly is the sixth studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, released on September 16, 1997, by Columbia Records. The album contained both hip hop and urban adult contemporary sounds, as well as some softer and more contemporary melodies. Throughout the project, Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff, with whom she had written and produced most of the material from her previous albums. She also worked with many famed hip hop producers and rappers, such as Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, Q-Tip, Missy Elliott and the Trackmasters. With the latter acts producing most of the album, Butterfly deviated from the contemporary sound of Carey's older records.","image":"Mariah_Carey_Butterfly_1997_album_cover.png.webp","url":"Butterfly_(Mariah_Carey_album)"}
