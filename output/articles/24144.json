{"title":"Jumpin' Jack Flash","summary":"\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" is a song by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released as a non-album single in 1968. Called \"supernatural Delta blues by way of Swinging London\" by Rolling Stone magazine,[5] the song was perceived by some as the band's return to their blues roots after the baroque pop and psychedelia heard on their preceding albums Aftermath (1966), Between the Buttons (1967) and especially Their Satanic Majesties Request (1967).[3][6] One of the group's most popular and recognisable songs, it has featured in films and been covered by numerous performers, notably Thelma Houston, Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Peter Frampton, Johnny Winter, Leon Russell and Alex Chilton. To date, it is the band's most-performed song: they have played it over 1,100 times in concert.[7]","image":"Jackflash1.jpg.webp"}
