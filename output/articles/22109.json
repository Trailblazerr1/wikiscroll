{"title":"Intelligent design","summary":"Intelligent design (ID) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God, presented by its proponents as \"an evidence-based scientific theory about life's origins\".[1][2][3][4][5] Proponents claim that \"certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.\"[6] ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses, and is therefore not science.[7][8][9] The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute,  a Christian, politically conservative think tank based in the United States.[n 1]","image":"Watch_with_no_background.png.webp"}
