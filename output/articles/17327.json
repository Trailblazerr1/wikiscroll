{"title":"Galaxy morphological classification","summary":"Galaxy morphological classification is a system used by astronomers to divide galaxies into groups based on their visual appearance. There are several schemes in use by which galaxies can be classified according to their morphologies, the most famous being the Hubble sequence, devised by Edwin Hubble and later expanded by GÃ©rard de Vaucouleurs and Allan Sandage. However, galaxy classification and morphology are now largely done using computational methods and physical morphology.","image":"HubbleTuningFork.jpg.webp","url":"Galaxy_morphological_classification"}
