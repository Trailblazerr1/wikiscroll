It caused severe hardships in economic terms and living conditions in a country still recovering from the Second World War. There were massive disruptions of energy supply for homes, offices and factories. Animal herds froze or starved to death. People suffered from the persistent cold, and many businesses shut down temporarily. When warm weather returned, the ice thawed and flooding was severe in most low-lying areas.","image":"1947_winter_troops_clear_rails.JPG.webp","url":"Winter_of_1946–47_in_the_United_Kingdom"}
