He was most notable for designing the Sydney Opera House in Australia, completed in 1973.[2] When it was declared a World Heritage Site on 28 June 2007, Utzon became only the second person to have received such recognition for one of his works during his lifetime, after Oscar Niemeyer.[3] Other noteworthy works include Bagsværd Church near Copenhagen and the National Assembly Building in Kuwait. He also made important contributions to housing design, especially with his Kingo Houses near Helsingør.[4]","image":"Jorn_Utzon_2000_by_Ole_Haupt.jpg.webp"}
