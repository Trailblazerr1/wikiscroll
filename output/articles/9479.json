{"title":"Chemist","summary":"A chemist (from Greek chēm(ía) alchemy; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchemist)[1] is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, chemical reaction rates, and other chemical properties. In Commonwealth English, pharmacists are often called chemists.","image":"Metsu%2C_Gabriël_-_L'Apothicaire_-_c._1651-1667.jpg.webp","url":"Chemist"}
