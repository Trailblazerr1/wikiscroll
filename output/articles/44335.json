{"title":"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask","summary":"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask[lower-alpha 1] is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 home console. It was released worldwide in 2000 as the sixth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series and was the second to use 3D graphics, following 1998's The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, to which it is a direct sequel. Designed by a creative team led by Eiji Aonuma, Yoshiaki Koizumi, and Shigeru Miyamoto, Majora's Mask was completed in less than two years. It featured enhanced graphics and several gameplay changes from its predecessor, though it reused a number of elements and character models, which the game's creators called a creative decision made necessary by time constraints.","image":"The_Legend_of_Zelda_-_Majora's_Mask_Box_Art.jpg.webp","url":"The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora's_Mask"}
