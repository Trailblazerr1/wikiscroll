{"title":"Grass Fight","summary":"The Grass Fight was a small battle during the Texas Revolution, fought between the Mexican Army and the Texian Army.  The battle took place on November 26, 1835, just south of San Antonio de Béxar in the Mexican region of Texas.  The Texas Revolution had officially begun on October 2 and by the end of the month the Texian had initiated a siege of Béxar, home of the largest Mexican garrison in the province. Bored with the inactvity, many of the Texian soldiers returned home; a smaller number of adventurers from the United States arrived to replace them.  After the Texian Army rejected commander-in-chief Stephen F. Austin's call to launch an assault on Béxar on November 22, Austin resigned from the army. The men elected Edward Burleson their new commander-in-chief.","image":"Flag_of_Mexico_(1823-1864%2C_1867-1893).svg.png.webp","url":"Grass_Fight"}
