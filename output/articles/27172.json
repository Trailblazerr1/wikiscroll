{"title":"Loanword","summary":"A loanword (also loan word or loan-word) is a word as adopted from one language (the donor language) and incorporated into another language without translation. This is in contrast to cognates, which are words in two or more languages that are similar because they share an etymological origin, and calques, which involve translation. Loanwords from languages with different scripts are usually transliterated (between scripts), but they are not translated. Although the term loanword might suggest, through the ordinary meaning of the word loan (a loaned item being one returned to its original owner), that these might be temporary imports into the \"borrowing\" language, loanwords are in effect permanent adoptions from the \"donor\" language.[1]","image":"Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg.png.webp"}
