{"title":"Pentecostalism","summary":"Pentecostalism or classical Pentecostalism is a Protestant Christian movement[1][2] that emphasises direct personal experience of God through baptism with the Holy Spirit. The term Pentecostal is derived from Pentecost, an event that commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the followers of Jesus Christ, and the speaking in \"foreign\" tongues as described in the second chapter of the Acts of the Apostles. In Greek, it is the name for the Jewish Feast of Weeks.","image":"Chama_pentecoste.svg.png.webp"}
