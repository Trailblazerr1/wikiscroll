{"title":"Chicago River","summary":"The Chicago River is a system of rivers and canals with a combined length of 156 miles (251Â km)[1] that runs through the city of Chicago, including its center (the Chicago Loop).[2] Though not especially long, the river is notable because it is one of the reasons for Chicago's geographic importance: the related Chicago Portage is a link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River Basin, and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico.","image":"Chicago_River_5.jpg.webp"}
