{"title":"Banaue Rice Terraces","summary":"The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors of the Igorot people. The terraces are occasionally called the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\".[1][2][3] It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand.[4] The terraces are located approximately 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level. These are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half of the globe.[5]","image":"Banaue-terrace.JPG.webp"}
