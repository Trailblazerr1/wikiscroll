{"title":"Circassians","summary":"The Circassians, Cherkess or Adyghe (Adyghe: Адыгэхэр, romanized: Adıgəxər; Kabardian: Адыгэхэр, romanized: Adıgəxər) are an indigenous  Northwest Caucasian ethnic group and nation native to historical Circassia.[31] During the Circassian genocide perpetrated by Russia, most Circassians were exiled from their homeland in Circassia to Turkey and the Middle East, where the majority of them live today.[32] The Circassian language is the shared ancestral language of Circassians;[33] and Islam is their historical religion since the 16th century.[34] Circassia has been subject to repeated invasions since ancient times, and its isolated terrain and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the area has helped shape the Circassians' national character.","image":"Circassian_flag.svg.png.webp"}
