{"title":"Station wagon","summary":"A station wagon (US, also wagon) or estate car (UK, also estate), is an automotive body-style variant of a sedan/saloon with its roof extended rearward[1] over a shared passenger/cargo volume with access at the back via a third or fifth door (the liftgate or tailgate), instead of a trunk/boot lid.  The body style transforms a standard three-box design into a two-box design â€” to include an A, B, and C-pillar, as well as a D-pillar.  Station wagons can flexibly reconfigure their interior volume via fold-down rear seats to prioritize either passenger or cargo volume.","image":"2018_Volvo_V60_Momentum_PRO_D4_Automatic_2.0_Rear.jpg.webp","url":"Station_wagon"}
