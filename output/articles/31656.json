{"title":"Neogene","summary":"The Neogene ( /ˈniː.əˌdʒiːn, ˈniː.oʊ-/ NEE-ə-jeen, NEE-oh-)[6][7] (informally Upper Tertiary or Late Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period 23.03 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period 2.58 Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.[8] The term \"Neogene\" was coined in 1853 by the Austrian palaeontologist Moritz Hörnes (1815–1868).[9]","image":"Commons-logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Neogene"}
