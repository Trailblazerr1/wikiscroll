{"title":"P. T. Barnum","summary":"Phineas Taylor Barnum (/ˈbɑːrnəm/; July 5, 1810 – April 7, 1891) was an American showman, businessman, and politician, remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and founding the Barnum & Bailey Circus (1871–2017)[1] with James Anthony Bailey. He was also an author, publisher, and philanthropist, though he said of himself: \"I am a showman by profession ... and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me\".[2] According to his critics, his personal aim was \"to put money in his own coffers.\"[2] He is widely credited with coining the adage \"There's a sucker born every minute\",[3] although no proof can be found of him saying this.","image":"PT_Barnum_1851-crop.jpg.webp"}
