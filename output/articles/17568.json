{"title":"Gelding","summary":"A gelding is a castrated male horse or other equine, such as a pony, donkey or a mule. Castration, as well as the elimination of hormonally driven behavior associated with a stallion, allows a male equine to be calmer and better-behaved, making the animal quieter, gentler and generally more suitable as an everyday working animal.[1]  The gerund and participle \"gelding\" and the infinitive \"to geld\" refer to the castration procedure itself.","image":"Vesuvio_Bien_Vee_-_Paso_Fino_Bellas_Formas_National_Champion_3_Year_Old_Gelding_in_2001%3B_photo_taken_in_May_of_2006.JPG.webp"}
