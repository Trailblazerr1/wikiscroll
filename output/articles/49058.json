{"title":"Xanthophyll","summary":"Xanthophylls (originally phylloxanthins) are yellow pigments that occur widely in nature and form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group; the other division is formed by the carotenes. The name is from Greek xanthos (ξανθός, \"yellow\")[1] and phyllon (φύλλον, \"leaf\"),[2] due to their formation of the yellow band seen in early chromatography of leaf pigments.","image":"Raw_egg.jpg.webp","url":"Xanthophyll"}
