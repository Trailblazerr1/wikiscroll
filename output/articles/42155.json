{"title":"Station to Station","summary":"Station to Station is the 10th studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 23Â January 1976 by RCA Records. Regarded as one of his most significant works, the album was the vehicle for Bowie's performance persona, the Thin White Duke. Co-produced by Bowie and Harry Maslin, Station to Station was mainly recorded at Cherokee Studios in Los Angeles, California, in late 1975, after Bowie completed shooting the film The Man Who Fell to Earth; the cover art featured a still from the film. During the sessions, Bowie was dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later said that he recalled almost nothing of the production.","image":"Station_to_Station_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Station_to_Station"}
