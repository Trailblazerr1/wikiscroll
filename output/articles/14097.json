{"title":"Eclecticism","summary":"Eclecticism is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly to a single paradigm or set of assumptions, but instead draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies different theories in particular cases. However, this is often without conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined.","image":"Blaha_Rákóczi.JPG.webp","url":"Eclecticism"}
