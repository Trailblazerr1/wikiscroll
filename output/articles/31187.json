It is closely related to the blesmols and is the only species in the genus Heterocephalus of the family Heterocephalidae.[5] The naked mole-rat and the Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis)[6][7] are eusocial mammals, the highest classification of sociality. It has a highly unusual set of physical traits that allow it to thrive in a harsh underground environment and is the only mammalian thermoconformer, almost entirely ectothermic (cold-blooded) in how it regulates body temperature.[8]","image":"Nacktmull.jpg.webp","url":"Naked_mole-rat"}
