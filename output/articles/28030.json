{"title":"Magyarization","summary":"Magyarization (also Hungarization, Hungarianization; Hungarian: magyarosítás), after \"Magyar\"—the Hungarian autonym—was an assimilation or acculturation process by which non-Hungarian nationals living in Austro-Hungarian Transleithania adopted the Hungarian national identity and language in the period between the Compromise of 1867 and Austria-Hungary's dissolution in 1918. Magyarization occurred both voluntarily and as a result of social pressure, and was mandated in certain respects by specific government policies.[1]","image":"Hungarians_in_Hungary_(1890).png.webp"}
