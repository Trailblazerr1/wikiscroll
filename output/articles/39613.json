{"title":"Scholasticism","summary":"Scholasticism was a medieval school of philosophy that employed a critical method of philosophical analysis predicated upon a Latin Catholic theistic curriculum which dominated teaching in the medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700. It originated within the Christian monastic schools that were the basis of the earliest European universities.[1] The rise of scholasticism was closely associated with these schools that flourished in Italy, France, Spain and England.[2]","image":"Laurentius_de_Voltolina_001.jpg.webp"}
