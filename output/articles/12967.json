{"title":"Diffusion","summary":"Diffusion is the net movement of anything (for example, atoms, ions, molecules, energy) generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Diffusion is driven by a gradient in Gibbs free energy or chemical potential. It is possible to diffuse \"uphill\" from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration, like in spinodal decomposition.","image":"Diffusion.svg.png.webp","url":"Diffusion"}
