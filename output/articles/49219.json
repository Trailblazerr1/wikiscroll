{"title":"Yeshiva","summary":"A yeshiva (/jəˈʃiːvə/; Hebrew: ישיבה‎, lit. 'sitting'; pl. ישיבות‎, yeshivot or yeshivos) is a Jewish educational institution that focuses on the study of traditional religious texts, primarily the Talmud and the Torah, and halacha (Jewish law). The studying is usually done through daily shiurim (lectures or classes) as well as in study pairs called chavrusas (Aramaic for 'friendship'[1] or 'companionship'[2]). Chavrusa-style learning is one of the unique features of the yeshiva.","image":"Mirs_14.JPG.webp"}
