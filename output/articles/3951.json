{"title":"Antifreeze","summary":"An antifreeze is an additive which lowers the freezing point of a water-based liquid.  An antifreeze mixture is used to achieve freezing-point depression for cold environments.  Common antifreezes also increase the boiling point of the liquid, allowing higher coolant temperature.[1] However, all common antifreeze additives also have lower heat capacities than water, and do reduce water's ability to act as a coolant when added to it.[2]","image":"Antifreeze_in_the_radiator.jpg.webp","url":"Antifreeze"}
