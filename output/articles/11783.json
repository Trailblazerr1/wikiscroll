{"title":"Cyberman","summary":"The Cybermen are a fictional race of cyborgs who are among the most persistent enemies of The Doctor in the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who.  Within the context of the series, the Cybermen are a species of emotionless space-faring cyborgs who, often painfully, surgically convert human beings (or other similar species) to join and populate their ranks. First appearing in 1966, the Cybermen were created by Dr. Kit Pedler (the unofficial scientific advisor to the show) and story editor Gerry Davis.","image":"Cyberman_2020_redesign.jpg.webp","url":"Cyberman"}
