{"title":"History of silk","summary":"The production of silk originated in Neolithic period China within the Yangshao culture (4th millennium BC). Though it would later reach other places in the world, the art of silk production remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at 114 BC, though China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. The use of silk within China was not confined to clothing alone, and silk was used for a number of applications, such as writing. Within clothing, the color of silk worn also held social importance, and formed an important guide of social class during the Tang dynasty.","image":"Court_ladies_pounding_silk_from_a_painting_(捣练图)_by_Emperor_Huizong.jpg.webp","url":"History_of_silk"}
