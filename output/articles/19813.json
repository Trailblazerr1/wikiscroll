{"title":"Hawking radiation","summary":"Hawking radiation is thermal radiation that is theorized to be released outside a black hole's event horizon because of relativistic quantum effects. It is named after the physicist Stephen Hawking, who developed a theoretical argument for its existence in 1974.[1]  Hawking radiation is a purely kinematic effect that is generic to Lorentzian geometries containing event horizons or local apparent horizons.[2][3]","image":"Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg.png.webp","url":"Hawking_radiation"}
