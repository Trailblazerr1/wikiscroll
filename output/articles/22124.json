{"title":"Intercontinental ballistic missile","summary":"An intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) is a missile with a minimum range of 5,500 kilometres (3,400Â mi)[1] primarily designed for nuclear weapons delivery (delivering one or more thermonuclear warheads). Similarly, conventional, chemical, and biological weapons can also be delivered with varying effectiveness, but have never been deployed on ICBMs. Most modern designs support multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing a single missile to carry several warheads, each of which can strike a different target. Russia, the United States, China, France, India, the United Kingdom, and North Korea are the only countries that have operational ICBMs.","image":"Titan_II_launch.jpg.webp"}
