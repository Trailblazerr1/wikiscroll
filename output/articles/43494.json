{"title":"Taxus baccata","summary":"Taxus baccata is a species of evergreen tree in the family Taxaceae, native to western, central and southern Europe (including the British Isles), northwest Africa, northern Iran, and southwest Asia.[4] It is the tree originally known as yew, though with other related trees becoming known, it may now be known as common yew,[5] English yew,[6] or European yew. It is primarily grown as an ornamental. Most parts of the plant are poisonous, with toxins that can be absorbed through inhalation and through the skin;[7] consumption of even a small amount of the foliage can result in death.[8][9][10][11]","image":"Taxus_baccata_MHNT.jpg.webp","url":"Taxus_baccata"}
