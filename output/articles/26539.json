{"title":"List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders","summary":"In basketball, points are accumulated through free throws or field goals.[1] The National Basketball Association's (NBA) scoring title is awarded to the player with the highest points per game average in a given season. The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968–69 season, after which points per game was used to determine the leader instead.[2] The three-point field goal was introduced in the NBA at the start of the 1979–80 season.[3][4] To qualify for the scoring title, a player must appear in at least 58 games (out of 82). However, a player who appears in fewer than 58 games may qualify as annual scoring leader if his point total would have given him the greatest average, had he appeared in 58 games. This has been the requirement since the 2013–14 season, with requirements changing several times previously throughout history.[5]","image":"Jordan_Lipofsky.jpg.webp"}
