{"title":"Emperor of China","summary":"Emperor of China, or Huángdì, was the monarch of China during the imperial period of Chinese history. In traditional Chinese political theory, the emperor was considered the Son of Heaven and the autocrat of All under Heaven. Under the Han dynasty, Confucianism replaced Legalism as the official political theory and succession theoretically followed agnatic primogeniture. The succession of emperors in a paternal family line constituted a dynasty.","image":"Inscription_on_Imperial_Seal_of_China_\"受命於天_既壽永昌\".svg.png.webp"}
