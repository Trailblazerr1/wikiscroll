{"title":"Scabies","summary":"Scabies (also known as the seven-year itch[1]) is a contagious skin infestation by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei.[1][3] The most common symptoms are severe itchiness and a pimple-like rash.[2] Occasionally, tiny burrows may appear on the skin.[2] In a first-ever infection, the infected person will usually develop symptoms within two to six weeks.[2] During a second infection, symptoms may begin within 24 hours.[2] These symptoms can be present across most of the body or just certain areas such as the wrists, between fingers, or along the waistline.[2] The head may be affected, but this is typically only in young children.[2] The itch is often worse at night.[2] Scratching may cause skin breakdown and an additional bacterial infection in the skin.[2]","image":"Scabies-burrow.jpg.webp","url":"Scabies"}
