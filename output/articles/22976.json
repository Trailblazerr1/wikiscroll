{"title":"James Webb Space Telescope","summary":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a space telescope being jointly developed by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). It is planned to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope as NASA's Flagship astrophysics mission.[6][7] The JWST, which is scheduled to be launched on 22 December 2021 during Ariane flight VA256, will provide improved infrared resolution and sensitivity over Hubble, and will enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, including observing some of the most distant events and objects in the universe, such as the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.","image":"JWST_spacecraft_model_2.png.webp","url":"James_Webb_Space_Telescope"}
