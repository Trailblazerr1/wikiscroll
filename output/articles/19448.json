{"title":"Halloumi","summary":"Halloumi or haloumi (Greek: Χαλλούμι) (/həˈluːmi/) is a semi-hard, unripened cheese made from a mixture of goats' and sheep's milk, and sometimes also cows' milk.[4][5][6][7] It has a high melting point and so can easily be fried or grilled, a property that makes it a popular meat substitute. Rennet (mostly vegetarian or microbial) is used to curdle the milk in halloumi production,[8] although no acid-producing bacteria are used in its preparation.[9]","image":"Halloumislice_zoom.jpg.webp","url":"Halloumi"}
