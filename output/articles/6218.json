{"title":"Bengal famine of 1943","summary":"The Bengal famine of 1943 was a famine in the Bengal province of British India (now Bangladesh, West Bengal and eastern India) during World War II. An estimated 2.1â€“3 million,[upper-alpha 1] out of a population of 60.3 million, died of starvation, malaria, and other diseases aggravated by malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions and lack of health care. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and catastrophically disrupted the social fabric. Eventually, families disintegrated; men sold their small farms and left home to look for work or to join the British Indian Army, and women and children became homeless migrants, often travelling to Calcutta or other large cities in search of organised relief.[8] Historians usually characterise the famine as anthropogenic (man-made),[9] asserting that wartime colonial policies created and then exacerbated the crisis. A minority view holds, however, that the famine was the result of natural causes.[10]","image":"Dead_or_dying_children_on_a_Calcutta_street_(the_Statesman_22_August_1943).jpg.webp","url":"Bengal_famine_of_1943"}
