{"title":"Bradley Wiggins","summary":"Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins, CBE (born 28 April 1980) is a British former professional road and track racing cyclist, who competed professionally between 2001 and 2016. He began his cycling career on the track, but later made the transition to road cycling. He won world titles in four disciplines (Madison, individual pursuit, team pursuit and road time trial), and Olympic gold in three (individual pursuit, team pursuit and road time trial). He is the only rider to have won both World and Olympic championships on both the track and the road as well as winning the Tour de France. He has worn the leader's jersey in each of the three Grand Tours of cycling and held the world record in team pursuit on multiple occasions. He won a gold medal at four successive Olympic Games from 2004 to 2016, and held the record as Great Britain's most decorated Olympian with 8 medals until Jason Kenny won his 9th in 2021. He is the only rider to win both the Tour de France and Olympic Gold in the same year, winning them a week apart in 2012.[4] During his career and afterwards he faced a series of allegations that he exploited a loophole in cyclingâ€™s anti-doping regulations to use a performance-enhancing drug, but he did not receive any bans or suspensions in relation to doping during his career.[5]","image":"2015_UEC_Track_Elite_European_Championships_158_(cropped).JPG.webp","url":"Bradley_Wiggins"}
