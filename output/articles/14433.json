{"title":"Electrical connector","summary":"An electrical connector is an electromechanical device used to join electrical conductors and create an electrical circuit.[1] Most electrical connectors have a gender – i.e. the male component, called a plug, connects to the female component, or socket. The connection may be removable (as for portable equipment), require a tool for assembly and removal, or serve as a permanent electrical joint between two points.[2] An adapter can be used to join dissimilar connectors.","image":"ConnectorSymbols.svg.png.webp","url":"Electrical_connector"}
