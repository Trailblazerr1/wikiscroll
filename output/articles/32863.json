The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons,[3] being native to 25 countries throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia[4] and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara.[3] It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests.[3] The common name is derived from its coat colour, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.","image":"Olive_baboon_Ngorongoro.jpg.webp"}
