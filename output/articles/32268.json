{"title":"Non-metropolitan county","summary":"A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.8 million.[1] The term shire county is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most, such as Wiltshire and Staffordshire, end in the suffix \"-shire\". Of the remainder, some counties had the \"-shire\" ending but have lost it over time, such as Devon and Somerset.","image":"English_non-metropolitan_counties_2021.svg.png.webp","url":"Non-metropolitan_county"}
