{"title":"Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)","summary":"Virgil Riley Runnels Jr. (October 11, 1945 â€“ June 11, 2015), better known as \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes, was an American professional wrestler, booker, and trainer who most notably worked for the National Wrestling Alliance, Jim Crockett Promotions, and the World Wrestling Federation, later known as the WWE. Following his retirement from wrestling, he made occasional on-air appearances on WWE television and pay-per-views and worked as a backstage booker and producer in WWE's NXT developmental territory. Billed as \"the son of a plumber\", Rhodes did not have a typical wrestler's physique; his character was that of the \"common man\", known for the personality exhibited in his interviews. WWE chairman Vince McMahon remarked that no wrestler \"personified the essence of charisma quite like Dusty Rhodes\".[7]","image":"2014-04-05_14-44-16_NEX-6_8325_DxO_(13918745806).jpg.webp","url":"Dusty_Rhodes_(wrestler)"}
