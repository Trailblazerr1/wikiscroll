{"title":"Pion","summary":"In particle physics, a pion (or a pi meson, denoted with the Greek letter pi: π) is any of three subatomic particles: π0, π+, and π−. Each pion consists of a quark and an antiquark and is therefore a meson. Pions are the lightest mesons and, more generally, the lightest hadrons. They are unstable, with the charged pions π+ and π− decaying after a mean lifetime of 26.033 nanoseconds (2.6033×10−8 seconds), and the neutral pion π0 decaying after a much shorter lifetime of 85 attoseconds (8.5×10−17 seconds).[1] Charged pions most often decay into muons and muon neutrinos, while neutral pions generally decay into gamma rays.","image":"Quark_structure_pion.svg.png.webp"}
