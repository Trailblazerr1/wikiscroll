{"title":"Styracosaurus","summary":"Styracosaurus (/stɪˌrækəˈsɔːrəs/ sti-RAK-ə-SOR-əs; meaning \"spiked lizard\" from the Ancient Greek styrax/στύραξ \"spike at the butt-end of a spear-shaft\" and sauros/σαῦρος \"lizard\")[1] is a genus of herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur from the Cretaceous Period (Campanian stage), about 75.5 to 75 million years ago. It had four to six long parietal spikes extending from its neck frill, a smaller jugal horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, which may have been up to 60 centimeters (2 feet) long and 15 centimeters (6 inches) wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years.","image":"Torosaurus%2C_is_it%3F_(20752673005).jpg.webp"}
