{"title":"Jack Lemmon","summary":"John Uhler Lemmon III (February 8, 1925 â€“ June 27, 2001) was an American actor. Equally proficient in both dramatic and comic roles, Lemmon was known for his anxious, middle-class everyman screen persona in dramedy pictures,[1] leading The Guardian to coin him \"the most successful tragi-comedian of his age.\"[2] He was nominated for an Academy Award eight times, winning twice, and among many other accolades, including six Golden Globe Awards (counting the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award), three BAFTA Awards, and two Emmy Awards. In 1988, he was awarded the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the American cinema.","image":"Jack_Lemmon_-_1968.jpg.webp","url":"Jack_Lemmon"}
