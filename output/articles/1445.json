{"title":"Political economy","summary":"Political economy[1][2] is the study of production and trade and their relations with law, custom and government; and with the distribution of national income and wealth. As a discipline, political economy  originated in moral philosophy, in the 18th century, to explore the administration of states' wealth, with \"political\" signifying the Greek word polity and \"economy\" signifying the Greek word οἰκονομία (household management). The earliest works of political economy are usually attributed to the British scholars Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, and David Ricardo, although they were preceded by the work of the French physiocrats, such as François Quesnay (1694–1774) and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot (1727–1781).[3] There is also a tradition which is almost as long, of critique of political economy.","image":"Emblem-money.svg.png.webp"}
