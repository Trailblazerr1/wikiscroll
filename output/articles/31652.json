{"title":"Neoclassicism","summary":"Neoclassicism (also spelled Neo-classicism; from Greek νέος nèos, \"new\" and Greek κλασικός klasikόs, \"of the highest rank\")[1] was a Western cultural movement in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that drew inspiration from the art and culture of classical antiquity. Neoclassicism was born in Rome largely thanks to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, at the time of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum, but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.[2][3] The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.","image":"Psyche_revived_by_cupid's_kiss%2C_Paris_2_October_2011_002.jpg.webp"}
