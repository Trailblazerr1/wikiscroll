{"title":"Lethal dose","summary":"In toxicology, the lethal dose (LD) is an indication of the lethal toxicity of a given substance or type of radiation. Because resistance varies from one individual to another, the \"lethal dose\" represents a dose (usually recorded as dose per kilogram of subject body weight) at which a given percentage of subjects will die. The lethal concentration is a lethal dose measurement used for gases or particulates. The LD may be based on the standard person concept, a theoretical individual that has perfectly \"normal\" characteristics, and thus not apply to all sub-populations.","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp","url":"Lethal_dose"}
