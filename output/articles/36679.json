{"title":"Quakers","summary":"Quakers belong to a historically Protestant Christian set of denominations known formally as the Religious Society of Friends.[2] Members of these movements are generally united by a belief in each human's ability to experience the light within or see \"that of God in every one\".[3] Some profess a priesthood of all believers inspired by the First Epistle of Peter.[4][5][6][7] They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and traditional Quaker understandings of Christianity. There are also Nontheist Quakers, whose spiritual practice does not rely on the existence of God. To differing extents, the Friends avoid creeds and hierarchical structures.[8] In 2007, there were about 359,000 adult Quakers worldwide.[9] In 2017, there were 377,557 adult Quakers, 49 per cent of them in Africa.[10]","image":"George_Fox.jpg.webp"}
