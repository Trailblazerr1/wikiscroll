{"title":"List of UEFA Super Cup matches","summary":"The UEFA Super Cup is an annual association football match contested between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. Established in 1972, it was contested between the winners of the European Cup (or UEFA Champions League since 1993) and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup until 1999, when the latter was discontinued by UEFA. The last Super Cup disputed in this format was the 1999 UEFA Super Cup between Lazio and Manchester United, which Lazio won 1â€“0. The competition was originally played over two legs, one at each participating club's stadium in the winter months, but since the 1998 edition, it consists of a single match played at a neutral venue in August.[1] Between 1998 and 2012, the Stade Louis II in Monaco hosted the Super Cup, but since 2013, it has taken place every year at a different stadium across Europe.[2][3]","image":"2015_UEFA_Super_Cup_54.jpg.webp","url":"List_of_UEFA_Super_Cup_matches"}
