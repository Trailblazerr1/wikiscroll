{"title":"National Institutes of Health","summary":"The National Institutes of Health (NIH /ɛn.aɪ.ˈeɪtʃ/) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. It was founded in the late 1880s and is now part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The majority of NIH facilities are located in Bethesda, Maryland and other nearby suburbs of the Washington metropolitan area, with other primary facilities in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina and smaller satellite facilities located around the United States. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.","image":"NIH_Master_Logo_Vertical_2Color.png.webp"}
