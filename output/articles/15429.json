{"title":"Even-toed ungulate","summary":"The even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla /ˌɑːrtioʊˈdæktɪlə/, from Ancient Greek  ἄρτιος, ártios 'even', and  δάκτυλος, dáktylos 'finger, toe') are ungulates—hoofed animals—which bear weight equally on two (an even number) of their five toes: the third and fourth. The other three toes are either present, absent, vestigial, or pointing posteriorly. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates bear weight on an odd number of the five toes. Another difference between the two with the exception of Suina many other even-toed ungulates digest plant cellulose in one or more stomach chambers rather than in their intestine as the odd-toed ungulates do.","image":"The_Artiodactyla.jpg.webp","url":"Even-toed_ungulate"}
