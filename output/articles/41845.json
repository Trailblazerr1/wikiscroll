{"title":"Squall","summary":"A squall is a sudden, sharp increase in wind speed lasting minutes, contrary to a wind gust lasting seconds.[1] They are usually associated with active weather, such as rain showers, thunderstorms, or heavy snow.[2] Squalls refer to the increase to the sustained winds over that time interval, as there may be higher gusts during a squall event.[3] They usually occur in a region of strong sinking air or cooling in the mid-atmosphere. These force strong localized upward motions at the leading edge of the region of cooling, which then enhances local downward motions just in its wake.","image":"Rainbow1_-_NOAA.jpg.webp","url":"Squall"}
