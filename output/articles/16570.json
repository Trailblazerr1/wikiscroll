{"title":"Foie gras","summary":"Foie gras (English: /ˌfwɑːˈɡrɑː/ (listen), French: [fwa ɡʁɑ]; French for 'fat liver') is a specialty food product made of the liver of a duck or goose. According to French law,[1] foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by gavage (force feeding). In Spain[2] and other countries, it is occasionally produced using natural feeding.[3] Ducks are force-fed twice a day for 12.5 days and geese three times a day for around 17 days. Ducks are typically slaughtered at 100 days and geese at 112 days.[4]","image":"Loudspeaker.svg.png.webp"}
