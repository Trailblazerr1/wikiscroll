{"title":"Lloyd's of London","summary":"Lloyd's of London, generally known simply as Lloyd's, is an insurance and reinsurance market located in London, United Kingdom. Unlike most of its competitors in the industry, it is not an insurance company; rather, Lloyd's is a corporate body governed by the Lloyd's Act 1871 and subsequent Acts of Parliament. It operates as a partially-mutualised marketplace within which multiple financial backers, grouped in syndicates, come together to pool and spread risk. These underwriters, or \"members\", are a collection of both corporations and private individuals, the latter being traditionally known as \"Names\".","image":"Lloyd's_of_London_logo.svg.png.webp","url":"Lloyd's_of_London"}
