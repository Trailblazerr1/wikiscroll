{"title":"Extended play","summary":"An extended play record, usually referred to as an EP, is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single but fewer than an album or LP record.[1][2][3] Contemporary EPs generally contain four or five tracks, and are considered \"less expensive and time-consuming\" for an artist to produce than an album.[3] An EP originally referred to specific types of records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and LP,[4] but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well.[5]","image":"Michael_Nesmith_EP.jpg.webp"}
