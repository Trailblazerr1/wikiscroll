{"title":"USS Nevada (BB-36)","summary":"USS Nevada (BB-36), the third United States Navy ship to be named after the 36th state, was the lead ship of the two  Nevada-class battleships. Launched in 1914, Nevada was a leap forward in dreadnought technology; four of her new features would be included on almost every subsequent US battleship: triple gun turrets,[lower-alpha 3] oil in place of coal for fuel, geared steam turbines for greater range, and the \"all or nothing\" armor principle. These features made Nevada, alongside her sister ship Oklahoma, the first US Navy \"standard-type\" battleships.","image":"Uss_nevada.jpg.webp"}
