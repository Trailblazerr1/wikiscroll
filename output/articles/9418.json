{"title":"Charvaka","summary":"Charvaka (Sanskrit: चार्वाक; IAST: Cārvāka), also known as Lokāyata, is an ancient school of Indian materialism[1] or hedonism. It is a heterodox school of Indian philosophy. Charvaka holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism and rejects ritualism and supernaturalism.[2][3][4][5][6] It was a popular belief system in ancient India.[lower-alpha 1] It rejects supernatural concepts like god and soul. It also rejects metaphysical concepts like afterlife (or reincarnation) and moksha. Although Charvaka doctrine had disappeared by the end of the medieval period, its historical importance can be identified by the lengthy attempts to refute it found in both Buddhist and Hindu philosophical texts, which also constitute the main sources for knowledge of this philosophy.[8]","image":"Symbol_category_class.svg.png.webp"}
