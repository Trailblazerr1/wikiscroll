{"title":"SR Merchant Navy class","summary":"The SR Merchant Navy class (originally known as the 21C1 class, and later informally known as Bulleid Pacifics, Spam Cans – which name was also applied to the Light Pacifics – or Packets) is a class of air-smoothed 4-6-2 Pacific steam locomotives designed for the Southern Railway by Oliver Bulleid.  The Pacific design was chosen in preference to several others proposed by Bulleid.
