{"title":"Second Intifada","summary":"The Second Intifada (Arabic: الانتفاضة الثانية‎ Al-Intifada al-Thaniya; Hebrew: האינתיפאדה השנייה‎ Ha-Intifāda ha-Shniya), also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada (Arabic: انتفاضة الأقصى‎ Intifāḍat al-ʾAqṣā),[12] was a Palestinian uprising against Israel.[12] The general triggers for the violence were proposed as the failure of the 2000 Camp David Summit to reach final agreement on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in July 2000.[13] The violence started in September 2000, after Ariel Sharon made a highly provocative visit to the Temple Mount.[13] The visit itself was peaceful, but, as anticipated, it sparked protests and riots which the Israeli police put down with rubber bullets and tear gas.[14]","image":"Allenby_Street_bus_bombing_III.jpg.webp","url":"Second_Intifada"}
