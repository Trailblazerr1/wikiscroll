{"title":"SDS-PAGE","summary":"SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulphateâ€“polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), is a discontinuous electrophoretic system developed by Ulrich K. Laemmli which is commonly used as a method to separate proteins with molecular masses between 5 and 250 kDa.[1][2] The combined use of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, also known as sodium lauryl sulfate) and polyacrylamide gel allows to eliminate the influence of structure and charge, and proteins are separated solely on the basis of differences in their molecular weight.","image":"RBC_Membrane_Proteins_SDS-PAGE_gel.jpg.webp"}
