{"title":"Online community","summary":"An online community, also called an internet community or web community, is a community whose members interact with each other primarily via the Internet. Members of the community usually share common interests. For many, online communities may feel like home, consisting of a \"family of invisible friends\". Additionally, these \"friends\" can be connected through gaming communities and gaming companies. Those who wish to be a part of an online community usually have to become a member via a specific site and thereby gain access to specific content or links.","image":"Invision_Power_Board_3.4.6.jpg.webp","url":"Online_community"}
