{"title":"Designer baby","summary":"A designer baby is a baby whose genetic makeup has been selected or altered, often to include a particular gene or to remove genes associated with a health condition.[1] This process usually involves analysing a wide range of human embryos to identify genes associated with particular diseases and characteristics, and selecting embryos that have the desired genetic makeup; a process known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Other potential methods by which a baby's genetic information can be altered involve directly editing the genome before birth. This process is not routinely performed and only one instance of this is known to have occurred as of 2019, where Chinese twins Lulu and Nana were edited as embryos, causing widespread criticism.[2]","image":"Genetic_engineering_logo.png.webp"}
