{"title":"Covered bridge","summary":"A covered bridge is a timber-truss bridge with a roof, decking, and siding, which in most covered bridges create an almost complete enclosure.[1] The purpose of the covering is to protect the wooden structural members from the weather. Uncovered wooden bridges typically have a lifespan of only 20 years because of the effects of rain and sun, but a covered bridge could last over 100 years.[2] Once common, only about 1 in 10 survived the 20th century.[3] The relatively small number of surviving bridges is due to deliberate replacement, neglect, and the high cost of restoration.[4]","image":"Larrys_Creek_Covered_Bridge.JPG.webp","url":"Covered_bridge"}
