{"title":"Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad","summary":"The Nawab of Bengal[2][3][4][5] (Bengali: বাংলার নবাব) was the hereditary ruler of Bengal Subah in Mughal India. The Nawab of a princely state or autonomous province is comparable to the European title of Grand Duke. In the early 18th-century, the Nawab of Bengal was the de facto independent ruler of the three regions of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa which constitute the modern-day sovereign country of Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa.[6][7][8] They are often referred to as the Nawab of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa (Bengali: বাংলা, বিহার ও ওড়িশার নবাব).[9] The Nawabs were based in Murshidabad which was centrally located within Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. Their chief , a former prime minister, became the first Nawab. The Nawabs continued to issue coins in the name of the Mughal Emperor. But for all practical purposes, the Nawabs governed as independent monarchs. Bengal continued to contribute the largest share of funds to the imperial treasury in Delhi. The Nawabs, backed by bankers such as the Jagat Seth, became the financial backbone of the Mughal court. During the 18th-century, the Nawabs of Bengal were among the wealthiest rulers in the world.[10]","image":"Flag_of_the_Principality_of_Bengal_(15th-18th_century).svg.png.webp","url":"Nawabs_of_Bengal_and_Murshidabad"}
