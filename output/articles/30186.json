{"title":"Mob rule","summary":"Mob rule or ochlocracy (Greek: ὀχλοκρατία, romanized: okhlokratía;  Latin: ochlocratia) is the rule of government by a mob or mass of people and the intimidation of legitimate authorities. Insofar as it represents a pejorative for majoritarianism, it is akin to the Latin phrase mobile vulgus, meaning \"the fickle crowd\", from which the English term \"mob\" originally was derived in the 1680s.","image":"A_coloured_voting_box.svg.png.webp","url":"Mob_rule"}
