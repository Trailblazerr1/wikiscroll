{"title":"List of Olympic medalists in baseball","summary":"Baseball is a sport formerly contested at the Summer Olympic Games. It was originally played as a demonstration sport in seven Olympics—1912, 1936, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1984, and 1988[1]— more than for any other sport in Olympic history.[2] These exhibitions featured a single game at the first five Olympic appearances and then a tournament format in 1984 and 1988.[1] The International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted baseball official status on October 13, 1986, for the 1992 Summer Olympics.[1][3][4] The sport was contested at each subsequent Games through 2008, after which the IOC removed it from the roster of Olympic sports.","image":"El_Duque_and_his_cigar!.jpg.webp"}
