{"title":"Sauna","summary":"A sauna (/ˈsɔːnə, ˈsaʊnə/,[1][2] Finnish: [ˈsɑu̯nɑ]), or sudatory, is a small room or building designed as a place to experience dry or wet heat sessions, or an establishment with one or more of these facilities. The steam and high heat make the bathers perspire. A thermometer in a sauna is typically used to measure heat, a hygrometer can be used to measure levels of humidity or steam. Infrared therapy is often referred to as a type of sauna, but according to the Finnish sauna organisations, infrared is not a sauna.[3]","image":"Sauna_2.jpg.webp"}
