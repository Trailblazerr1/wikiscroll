{"title":"Auriscalpium vulgare","summary":"Auriscalpium vulgare, commonly known as the pinecone mushroom, the cone tooth, or the ear-pick fungus, is a species of fungus in the family Auriscalpiaceae of the order Russulales. It was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus, who included it as a member of the tooth fungi genus Hydnum, but British mycologist Samuel Frederick Gray recognized its uniqueness and in 1821 transferred it to the genus Auriscalpium that he created to contain it. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe, Central America, North America, and temperate Asia. Although common, its small size and nondescript colors lead it to be easily overlooked in the pine woods where it grows. A.Â vulgare is not generally considered edible because of its tough texture, but some historical literature says it used to be consumed in France and Italy.","image":"Auriscalpium_vulgare_129877.jpg.webp","url":"Auriscalpium_vulgare"}
