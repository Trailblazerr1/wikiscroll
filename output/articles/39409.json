Sarah's relationship and influence with Princess Anne were widely known, and leading public figures often turned their attentions to her, hoping for favor from Anne. By the time Anne became queen, Sarah’s knowledge of government and intimacy with the queen had made her a powerful friend and a dangerous enemy.","image":"Sarah%2C_Duchess_of_Marlborough_by_Jervas.jpg.webp","url":"Sarah_Churchill,_Duchess_of_Marlborough"}
