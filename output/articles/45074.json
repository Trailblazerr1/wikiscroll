{"title":"Thuggee","summary":"Thuggee (UK: /θʌˈɡiː/, US: /ˈθʌɡi/) refers to the acts of the Thugs, who were organised gangs of professional robbers and murderers. The English word thug traces its roots to the Hindi ठग (ṭhag), which means 'swindler' or 'deceiver'.  Related words are the verb thugna ('to deceive'), from the Sanskrit स्थग (sthaga 'cunning, sly, fraudulent') and स्थगति (sthagati, 'he conceals').[2] This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers, was popular in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent and particularly India.","image":"Group_of_Thugs.gif"}
