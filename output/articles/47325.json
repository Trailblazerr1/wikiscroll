{"title":"Viacom (2005–2019)","summary":"The second incarnation of Viacom Inc. (/ˈvaɪəkɒm/ VY-ə-kom or /ˈviːəkɒm/ VEE-ə-kom; a portmanteau of Video & Audio Communications) was an American multinational mass media conglomerate with interests primarily in film and television, which was formed as a spin-off of the original Viacom on December 31, 2005. It was one of two companies which succeeded the first Viacom, alongside the second incarnation of CBS Corporation; both were owned by National Amusements, a theater company controlled by businessman Sumner Redstone. The spin-off was structured so that CBS Corporation would be the legal successor to the first Viacom, with the second Viacom being an entirely separated company.[4][5][6][7][8]","image":"Viacom_logo.svg.png.webp"}
