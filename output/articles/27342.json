{"title":"Lord Chamberlain's Men","summary":"The Lord Chamberlain's Men was a company of actors, or a \"playing company\" (as it then would likely have been described), for which Shakespeare wrote during most of his career. Richard Burbage played most of the lead roles, including Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth. Formed at the end of a period of flux in the theatrical world of London, it had become, by 1603, one of the two leading companies of the city and was subsequently patronized by James I.","image":"The_Old_Globe.jpg.webp"}
