{"title":"Type 1 diabetes","summary":"Type 1 diabetes (T1D), previously known as juvenile diabetes, is an autoimmune disease that originates when very little or no insulin is produced by the islets of Langerhans (containing beta cells) in the pancreas.[4] Insulin is a hormone required for the cells to use blood sugar for energy and it helps regulate normal glucose levels in the bloodstream.[2] Before treatment this results in high blood sugar levels in the body.[1] The common symptoms of this elevated blood sugar are frequent urination, increased thirst, increased hunger, weight loss, and other serious complications.[4][9] Additional symptoms may include blurry vision, tiredness, and slow wound healing.[2] Symptoms typically develop over a short period of time, often a matter of weeks.[1]","image":"Blue_circle_for_diabetes.svg.png.webp","url":"Type_1_diabetes"}
