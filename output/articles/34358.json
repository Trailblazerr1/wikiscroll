{"title":"Penis","summary":"A penis (plural penises or penes (/-niÀêz/) is the primary sexual organ that male animals use to inseminate females (or hermaphrodites) during copulation.[1][2] Such organs occur in many animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, but males do not bear a penis in every animal species, and in those species in which the male does bear a so-called penis, the penises in the various species are not necessarily homologous.","image":"Penis_asiatischer_Elefant.JPG.webp"}
