{"title":"Quantum","summary":"In physics, a quantum (plural quanta) is the minimum amount of any physical entity (physical property) involved in an interaction. The fundamental notion that a physical property can be \"quantized\" is referred to as \"the hypothesis of quantization\".[1] This means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum.","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Quantum"}
