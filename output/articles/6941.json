{"title":"Blood and soil","summary":"Blood and soil (German: Blut und Boden) is a nationalist slogan expressing Nazi Germany's ideal of a racially defined national body (\"blood\") united with a settlement area (\"soil\"). By it, rural and farm life forms are idealized as a counterweight to urban ones. It is tied to the contemporaneous German concept of Lebensraum, the belief that the German people were to expand into Eastern Europe, conquering and displacing the native Slavic and Baltic population via Generalplan Ost.","image":"Blut_und_Boden.svg.png.webp"}
