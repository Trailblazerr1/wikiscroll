{"title":"Delicate (Taylor Swift song)","summary":"\"Delicate\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017). It was written by Swift and its producers, Max Martin and Shellback. Swift described \"Delicate\" as one of the songs about vulnerability on Reputation, contrary to the album's recurring themes of vengeance and feigned disinterest in her perceived image. The lyrics are about her insecurity in whether her new love interest would be bothered by her blemished reputation. To create a sound accompanying the vulnerable sentiment, Martin and Shellback manipulated Swift's vocals with a vocoder. \"Delicate\" is an electropop ballad with dense synthesizers and house beats.","image":"Delicate_by_Taylor_Swift_(Sawyr_and_Ryan_Tedder_remix).png.webp"}
