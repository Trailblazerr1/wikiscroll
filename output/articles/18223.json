{"title":"Global North and Global South","summary":"The concept of Global North and Global South (or Northâ€“South divide in a global context) is used to describe a grouping of countries along socio-economic and political characteristics. The Global South is a term often used to identify lower-income countries on one side of the so-called divide, the other side being the countries of the Global North (often equated with developed countries).[1] As such, the term does not inherently refer to a geographical south; for example, most of the Global South is geographically within the Northern Hemisphere.[1]","image":"Global_North_and_Global_South.svg.png.webp"}
