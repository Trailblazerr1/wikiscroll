{"title":"Mitsuharu Misawa","summary":"Mitsuharu Misawa (三沢 光晴, Misawa Mitsuharu, June 18, 1962 – June 13, 2009) was a Japanese amateur and professional wrestler and promoter. He is primarily known for his time in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and also for forming the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion in 2000. In the early 1990s, Misawa gained fame alongside Toshiaki Kawada, Kenta Kobashi, and Akira Taue, who came to be nicknamed AJPW's \"Four Pillars of Heaven\",[7][nb 1] and whose matches developed the ōdō (王道, \"King's Road\") style of puroresu and received significant critical acclaim.[9] Despite never working in the United States during the 1990s, Misawa had significant stylistic influence upon American independent wrestling,[10] through the popularity of his work among tape-traders in the country.[11] Misawa is regarded by some as the greatest professional wrestler of all time.[12] However, the physical demands and consequences of the style in which he worked and the circumstances of his death have made his legacy, or at least that of ōdō, somewhat problematic.[13][14]","image":"Mitsuharu_Misawa%2C_2007.jpg.webp"}
