{"title":"Pale ale","summary":"Pale ale is a typically golden to amber coloured style of ale which is brewed using an ale yeast and predominantly pale malt.[1][2][3] The term first appeared around 1703 for beers made from malts dried with high-carbon coke, which resulted in a lighter colour than other beers popular at that time. Different brewing practices and hop quantities have resulted in a range of tastes and strengths within the pale ale family.","image":"THAT_Brewery_Bearfoot_Pale_Ale.jpg.webp","url":"Pale_ale"}
