{"title":"Beatlemania","summary":"Beatlemania was the fanaticism surrounding the English rock band the Beatles in the 1960s. The group's popularity grew in the United Kingdom throughout 1963, propelled by the singles \"Please Please Me\", \"From Me to You\" and \"She Loves You\". By October, the press adopted the term \"Beatlemania\" to describe the scenes of adulation that attended the band's concert performances. From the start of 1964, their world tours were characterised by the same levels of hysteria and high-pitched screaming by female fans, both at concerts and during the group's travels. Commentators likened the intensity of this adulation to a religious fervour and to a female masturbation fantasy. Among the displays of deity-like worship, fans would approach the band in the belief that they possessed supernatural healing powers.","image":"The_Beatles_in_America.JPG.webp","url":"Beatlemania"}
