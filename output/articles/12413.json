{"title":"Decline in insect populations","summary":"Several studies report a substantial decline in insect populations. Most commonly, the declines involve reductions in abundance, though in some cases entire species are going extinct. The declines are far from uniform. In some localities, there have been reports of increases in overall insect population, and some types of insects appear to be increasing in abundance across the world.","image":"Journal.pone.0185809.g004.PNG.webp","url":"Decline_in_insect_populations"}
