{"title":"Planck constant","summary":"The Planck constant, or Planck's constant, is a fundamental physical constant denoted h {\\displaystyle h} , and is of fundamental importance in quantum mechanics. A photon's energy is equal to its frequency multiplied by the Planck constant.  Due to massâ€“energy equivalence, the Planck constant also relates mass to frequency.","image":"b26be3e694314bc90c3215047e4a2010c6ee184a.svg","url":"Planck_constant"}
