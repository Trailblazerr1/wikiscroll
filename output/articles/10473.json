{"title":"Coinage Act of 1873","summary":"The Coinage Act of 1873 or Mint Act of 1873, 17 Stat. 424, was a general revision of the laws relating to the Mint of the United States. In abolishing the right of holders of silver bullion to have their metal struck into fully legal tender dollar coins, it ended bimetallism in the United States, placing the nation firmly on the gold standard. Because of this, the act became contentious in later years, and was denounced by some as the \"Crime of '73\".","image":"Great_Seal_of_the_United_States_(obverse).svg.png.webp","url":"Coinage_Act_of_1873"}
