{"title":"Species distribution","summary":"Species distribution —or species dispersion —[1] is the manner in which a biological taxon is spatially arranged.[2] The geographic limits of a particular taxon's distribution is its range, often represented as shaded areas on a map. Patterns of distribution change depending on the scale at which they are viewed, from the arrangement of individuals within a small family unit, to patterns within a population, or the distribution of the entire species as a whole (range). Species distribution is not to be confused with dispersal, which is the movement of individuals away from their region of origin or from a population center of high density.","image":"Juniperus_communis_range_map.gif"}
