{"title":"Indo-Aryan migrations","summary":"The Indo-Aryan migrations[note 1] were the migrations into the Indian subcontinent of Indo-Aryan peoples, an ethnolinguistic group that spoke Indo-Aryan languages, the predominant languages of today's North India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Indo-Aryan population movements into the region from Central Asia are considered to have started after 2000 BCE, as a slow diffusion during the Late Harappan period, which led to a language shift in the northern Indian subcontinent. Around the same time, the Iranian languages were brought into the Iranian plateau by the Iranians, who were closely related to the Indo-Aryans.","image":"Indo-European_migrations.gif","url":"Indo-Aryan_migrations"}
