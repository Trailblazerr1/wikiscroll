{"title":"Centriole","summary":"In cell biology a centriole is a cylindrical organelle composed mainly of a protein called tubulin.[1] Centrioles are found in most eukaryotic cells, but are not present in conifers (Pinophyta), flowering plants (angiosperms) and most fungi, and are only present in the male gametes of charophytes, bryophytes, seedless vascular plants, cycads, and Ginkgo.[2][3] A bound pair of centrioles, surrounded by a highly ordered mass of dense material, called the pericentriolar material (PCM),[4] makes up a structure called a centrosome.[1]","image":"Centrosome_(numbers_version).svg.png.webp","url":"Centriole"}
