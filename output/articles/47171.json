{"title":"Vascular tissue","summary":"Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium.  All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.","image":"Celery_cross_section.jpg.webp"}
