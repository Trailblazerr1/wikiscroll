{"title":"The Scouring of the Shire","summary":"\"The Scouring of the Shire\" is the penultimate chapter of the high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Fellowship hobbits, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin, return home to the Shire to find that it is under the brutal control of ruffians and their leader \"Sharkey\", revealed to be the Wizard Saruman. The ruffians have despoiled the Shire, cutting down trees and destroying old houses, as well as replacing the old mill with a larger one full of machinery which pollutes the air and the water. The hobbits rouse the Shire to rebellion, lead their fellow-hobbits to victory in the Battle of Bywater, and end Saruman's rule.","image":"Sketch_Map_of_The_Shire.svg.png.webp"}
