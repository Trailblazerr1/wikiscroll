{"title":"Foster care","summary":"Foster care is a system in which a minor has been placed into a ward, group home (residential child care community, treatment center, etc.), or private home of a state-certified caregiver, referred to as a \"foster parent\" or with a family member approved by the state. The placement of the child is normally arranged through the government or a social service agency. The institution, group home, or foster parent is compensated for expenses unless with a family member. In some states, relative or \"Kinship\" caregivers of children who are wards of the state are provided with a financial stipend.","image":"Childrens_migrant_programme.jpg.webp"}
