{"title":"NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player Award","summary":"The NBA All-Star Game Kobe Bryant Most Valuable Player[1] (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given to the player(s) voted best of the annual All-Star Game. The award was established in 1953 when NBA officials decided to designate an MVP for each year's game. The league also re-honored players from the previous two All-Star Games. Ed Macauley and Paul Arizin were selected as the 1951 and 1952 MVP winners respectively.[2] The winner is voted upon by a panel of media members, who cast their vote after the conclusion of the game. The player(s) with the most votes or ties for the most votes wins the award.[3] In February 2020, Commissioner Adam Silver renamed the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player in honor of four-time winner Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash a few weeks earlier.[1]","image":"Wilt_Chamberlain_Bill_Russell.jpg.webp","url":"NBA_All-Star_Game_Kobe_Bryant_Most_Valuable_Player_Award"}
