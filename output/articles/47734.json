{"title":"Von Willebrand factor","summary":"von Willebrand factor (VWF) (German: [fɔn ˈvɪləbʁant]) is a blood glycoprotein involved in hemostasis, specifically, platelet adhesion. It is deficient and/or defective in von Willebrand disease and is involved in many other diseases, including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Heyde's syndrome, and possibly hemolytic–uremic syndrome.[5] Increased plasma levels in many cardiovascular, neoplastic, metabolic (e.g. diabetes), and connective tissue diseases are presumed to arise from adverse changes to the endothelium, and may predict an increased risk of thrombosis.[6]","image":"PBB_Protein_VWF_image.jpg.webp","url":"Von_Willebrand_factor"}
