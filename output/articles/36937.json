{"title":"Radio-controlled car","summary":"Radio-controlled cars (or RC cars for short) are miniature model cars or trucks that can be controlled from a distance using a specialized transmitter or remote. The term \"RC\" has been used to mean both \"remote controlled\" and \"radio controlled\", where \"remote controlled\" includes vehicles that are controlled by radio, infrared or a physical wire connection (the latter is now obsolete). Common use of \"RC\" today usually refers only to vehicles controlled by radio, and this article focuses on radio-controlled vehicles only.[1]","image":"Rastar_range_rover_sport.JPG.webp","url":"Radio-controlled_car"}
