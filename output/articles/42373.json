{"title":"Stoicism","summary":"Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded by Zeno of Citium in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It is a philosophy of personal eudaimonic virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia - flourishing, by means of living an ethical life. The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia with a life spent practicing the cardinal virtues and living in accordance with nature.","image":"Paolo_Monti_-_Servizio_fotografico_(Napoli%2C_1969)_-_BEIC_6353768.jpg.webp","url":"Stoicism"}
