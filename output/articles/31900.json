{"title":"New York and New Jersey campaign","summary":"The New York and New Jersey campaign was a series of battles in 1776 and the winter months of 1777 for control of the Port of New York and the state of New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War between British forces under General Sir William Howe and the Continental Army under General George Washington.  Howe was successful in driving Washington out of New York, but overextended his reach into New Jersey, and ended the active campaign season in January 1777 with only a few outposts near the city.  The British held New York harbor for the rest of the war, using it as a base for expeditions against other targets.","image":"NY-NJ-retreat-1776.svg.png.webp","url":"New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign"}
