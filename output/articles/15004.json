{"title":"Equal temperament","summary":"An equal temperament is a musical temperament or tuning system, which approximates just intervals by dividing an octave (or other interval) into equal steps. This means the ratio of the frequencies of any adjacent pair of notes is the same, which gives an equal perceived step size as pitch is perceived roughly as the logarithm of frequency.[2]","image":"Equal_Temper_w_limits.svg.png.webp","url":"Equal_temperament"}
