{"title":"Head of government","summary":"The head of government is either the highest or second-highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, autonomous region, or other government who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments.  \"Head of government\" is often differentiated from \"head of state\" (as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list),[1][2][3] as they may be separate positions, individuals, or roles depending on the country.","image":"Fumio_Kishida_2021_(cropped).jpg.webp"}
