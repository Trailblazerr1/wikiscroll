{"title":"Accelerated Graphics Port","summary":"Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) is a parallel expansion card standard, designed for attaching a video card to a computer system to assist in the acceleration of 3D computer graphics. It was originally designed as a successor to PCI-type connections for video cards. Since 2004, AGP has been progressively phased out in favor of PCI Express (PCIe), which is serial, as opposed to parallel; by mid-2008, PCI Express cards dominated the market and only a few AGP models were available,[1] with GPU manufacturers and add-in board partners eventually dropping support for the interface in favor of PCI Express.","image":"Accelerated_Graphics_Port_(logo).svg.png.webp"}
