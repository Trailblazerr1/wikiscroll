{"title":"Yaws","summary":"Yaws is a tropical infection of the skin, bones, and joints caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum pertenue.[6][8] The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, 2 to 5 cm (0.79 to 1.97 in) in diameter.[6] The center may break open and form an ulcer.[6] This initial skin lesion typically heals after 3–6 months.[7] After weeks to years, joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin lesions may appear.[6] The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open.[7] The bones (especially those of the nose) may become misshapen.[7] After 5 years or more, large areas of skin may die, leaving scars.[6]","image":"Yaws_01.jpg.webp","url":"Yaws"}
