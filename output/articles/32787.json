{"title":"Oil tanker","summary":"An oil tanker, also known as a petroleum tanker, is a ship designed for the bulk transport of oil or its products. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers.[1] Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries.[1] Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets.","image":"Supertanker_AbQaiq.jpg.webp","url":"Oil_tanker"}
