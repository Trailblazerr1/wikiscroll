{"title":"Religious conversion","summary":"Religious conversion is the adoption of a set of beliefs identified with one particular religious denomination to the exclusion of others. Thus \"religious conversion\" would describe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with another. This might be from one to another denomination within the same religion, for example, from Baptist to Catholic Christianity or from Sunni Islam to Shiâ€™a Islam.[1] In some cases, religious conversion \"marks a transformation of religious identity and is symbolized by special rituals\".[2]","image":"Michelangelo_Merisi_da_Caravaggio_-_The_Conversion_of_St._Paul_-_WGA04135.jpg.webp"}
