{"title":"Philosophy","summary":"Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, 'love of wisdom')[1][2] is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about existence, reason, knowledge, values, mind, and language.[3][4] Such questions are often posed as problems[5][6] to be studied or resolved. Some sources claim the term was coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BCE);[7][8] others dispute this story,[9][10] arguing that Pythagoreans merely claimed use of a preexisting term.[11]  Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.[12][13][lower-roman 1]","image":"\"The_School_of_Athens\"_by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino.jpg.webp","url":"Philosophy"}
