{"title":"Iron Maiden (album)","summary":"Iron Maiden is the debut studio album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was released on 14 April 1980 in the United Kingdom by EMI Records and in the United States by Harvest and Capitol Records. The North American version included the song \"Sanctuary\", released in the UK as a non-album single. In 1998, along with the rest of the band's pre-1995 releases, Iron Maiden was remastered with \"Sanctuary\" added in all territories. However, 2014 vinyl reissues, 2015 digital releases and 2018 CD reissues use the original track listing across the globe. It is the band's only album to feature guitarist Dennis Stratton.","image":"Iron_Maiden_(album)_cover.jpg.webp","url":"Iron_Maiden_(album)"}
