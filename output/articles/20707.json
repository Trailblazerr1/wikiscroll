{"title":"Homo antecessor","summary":"Homo antecessor (Latin \"pioneer\") is an archaic human species recorded in the Spanish Sierra de Atapuerca from 1.2 to 0.8 million years ago during the Early Pleistocene. Populations may have been present elsewhere in Western Europe, and were among the first to colonise that region of the world (hence, the name). The first fossils were found in the Gran Dolina cave in 1994, and the species was formally described in 1997 as the last common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals, supplanting the more conventional H. heidelbergensis in this function. H. antecessor has since been reinterpreted as merely an offshoot, though probably one branching off just before the modern human/Neanderthal split.","image":"Reproducciones_del_cráneo_(frontal_ATD6-15_)_y_mandíbula_(parte_del_esqueleto_facial_ATD6-69)_del_Niño_de_la_Gran_Dolina_(Homínido_3)._Museo_Arqueológico_Nacional_de_España.jpg.webp","url":"Homo_antecessor"}
