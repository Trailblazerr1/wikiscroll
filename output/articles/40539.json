{"title":"Shtokavian","summary":"Shtokavian or Štokavian (/ʃtɒˈkɑːviən, -ˈkæv-/; Serbo-Croatian Latin: štokavski / Serbo-Croatian Cyrillic: штокавски, pronounced [ʃtǒːkaʋskiː])[1] is the prestige dialect of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language and the basis of its Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin standards.[2] It is a part of the South Slavic dialect continuum.[3][4] Its name comes from the form for the interrogatory pronoun for \"what\" in Western Shtokavian, što (it is šta in Eastern Shtokavian). This is in contrast to Kajkavian and Chakavian (kaj and ča also meaning \"what\").","image":"Serbo_croatian_language2005.png.webp"}
