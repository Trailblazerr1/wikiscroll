{"title":"Thomas-Alexandre Dumas","summary":"Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie (French: [tɔmɑ alɛksɑ̃dʁ dymɑ davi də la pajət(ə)ʁi]; known as Alexandre Dumas; 25 March 1762 – 26 February 1806) was a French general in Revolutionary France. Along with Toussaint Louverture in Haiti and Abram Petrovich Gannibal in Imperial Russia, Thomas-Alexandre Dumas is notable as a man of African descent (in Dumas's case, with a white father and black mother) leading European troops as a general officer. [1] He was the first person of color in the French military to become brigadier general, divisional general, and general-in-chief of a French army.[2] Dumas and Toussaint Louverture (appointed general-in-chief in 1797[3]) were the two highest-ranking officers of sub-Saharan African descent in the West until 1975, when \"Chappie\" James achieved the equivalent rank of four-star general in the United States Air Force.","image":"General_Dumas_by_Guillon_Lethière.jpg.webp"}
