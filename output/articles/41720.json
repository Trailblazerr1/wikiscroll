As of AugustÂ 2021, 49,623 spider species in 129 families have been recorded by taxonomists.[1] However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.[5]","image":"Spiders_Diversity.jpg.webp"}
