{"title":"1938 New England hurricane","summary":"The 1938 New England Hurricane (also referred to as the Great New England Hurricane and the Long Island Express Hurricane)[1][2] was one of the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclones to strike Long Island, New York, and New England. The storm formed near the coast of Africa on September 9, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson hurricane scale, before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane[3] on Long Island on September 21. It is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people,[4] damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at $306 million ($4.7 billion in 2017).[5] Multiple other sources, however, mention that the 1938 hurricane might have really been a more powerful Category 4, having winds similar to Hurricanes Hugo, Harvey, Frederic and Gracie when it ran through Long Island and New England.[6][7] Also, numerous others estimate the real damage between  $347 million and almost $410 million.[8] Damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951.[9] It remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane in recorded New England history, perhaps eclipsed in landfall intensity only by the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.[10]","image":"1938_hurricane_September_21%2C_1938_weather_map.jpg.webp"}
