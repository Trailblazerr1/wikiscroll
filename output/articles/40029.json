{"title":"Sentence (linguistics)","summary":"In linguistics and grammar, a sentence is a linguistic expression, such as the English example \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" In traditional grammar, it is typically defined as a string of words that expresses a complete thought, or as a unit consisting of a subject and predicate. In non-functional linguistics it is typically defined as a maximal unit of syntactic structure such as a constituent. In functional linguistics, it is defined as a unit of written texts delimited by graphological features such as upper case letters and markers such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks. This notion contrasts with a curve, which is delimited by phonologic features such as pitch and loudness and markers such as pauses; and with a clause, which is a sequence of words that represents some process going on throughout time.[1]","image":"OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png.webp","url":"Sentence_(linguistics)"}
