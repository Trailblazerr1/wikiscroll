{"title":"Diatomaceous earth","summary":"Diatomaceous earth (/ˌdaɪətəˈmeɪʃəs/), diatomite (/daɪˈætəmaɪt/), or kieselgur/kieselguhr is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that can be crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from more than 3 μm to less than 1 mm, but typically 10 to 200 μm. Depending on the granularity, this powder can have an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and has a low density as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven-dried diatomaceous earth is 80–90% silica, with 2–4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals), and 0.5–2% iron oxide.[1]","image":"Diatomaceous_Earth.jpg.webp"}
